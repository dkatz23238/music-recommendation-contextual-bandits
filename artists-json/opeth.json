[[Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt]] has been Opeth's frontman and primary songwriter since Isberg's departure. Opeth has consistently incorporated [[progressive metal|progressive]], [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[classical music|classical]], and [[jazz]] influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from [[death metal]], especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong [[dynamics (music)|dynamic]] shifts, as well as [[death growls]]. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of [[Mellotron]]s in their work. The band rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums, but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of ''[[Blackwater Park]]'', they have led several major world tours.\n\nOpeth has released 13 studio albums, four live DVDs, four live albums (three that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album ''[[Orchid (album)|Orchid]]'' in 1995. Although their eighth studio album, ''[[Ghost Reveries]]'', was quite popular in the United States, Opeth did not experience major American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album, ''[[Watershed (Opeth album)|Watershed]]'', which peaked at No. 23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release.

When \u00c5kerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that \u00c5kerfeldt would be joining the band.

Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint.

The group began to rely less on the [[blast beat]]s and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated [[acoustic guitar]]s and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with [[Candlelight Records]] in 1994.

It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music.

But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done ''Heritage''. I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think ''Heritage'' is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.<ref name=splittingfanbase /></blockquote>\n\nVocally, \u00c5kerfeldt shifts between traditional [[Death growl|death metal vocals]] for heavy sections, and clean, sometimes whispered or soft-spoken vocals over mellower passages.

I think it is great that Opeth has succeeded to this enormous extend that they have. It is a band with really good musicians for so many years and they just develop their sound in a very truthful way and honest condition. It is refreshing to see that kind of band getting that amount of recognition. | date = February 2010 | archive-date = 19 February 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170219001834/http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/en/interviews/view/id/3127 | url-status = live }}</ref> [[Simone Simons]] of Epica,<ref>{{cite web | access-date = 19 February 2017 | url = http://www.lagrosseradio.com/metal/webzine-metal/interview-metal/p4196-simone-simons-chanteuse-d-epica.html | language = fr | website = Lagrosseradio.com | quote = J'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 le nouvel album d'Opeth, qui reste \u00e0 ce jour mon groupe pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9&nbsp;... j'adore son c\u00f4t\u00e9 pysch\u00e9d\u00e9lique et space.

Personnellement j'aime les \"deux\" Opeth, et je suis contente de voir qu'il ne regarde pas autour de lui pour faire la musique qui lui plait vraiment, c'est un vrai musicien qui \u00e9coute son coeur. (I loved Opeth's new album, which remains my favorite band so far&nbsp;... I love its psychedelic side and space. Of course I went to see them live and it's funny to see that even here Mikael has totally stopped the growls, we discussed it together and besides he has a bit of criticism about it. Personally I like the \"two\" Opeth, and I'm glad to see that he does not look around him to make the music he really likes, he's a real musician who listens to his heart.) | title = Simone Simons, chanteuse d'Epica | date = 19 February 2012 | author = Ju de Melon | archive-date = 21 March 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170321035614/http://www.lagrosseradio.com/metal/webzine-metal/interview-metal/p4196-simone-simons-chanteuse-d-epica.html | url-status = live }}</ref> [[Oliver Palotai]] of [[Kamelot]],<ref>{{cite web | access-date = 19 February 2017 | url = http://www.progwereld.org/cms/kamelot-%E2%80%93-interview-met-oliver-palotai-en-thomas-youngblood-nav-hun-nieuwe-album-%E2%80%9Chaven%E2%80%9D/ | title = Kamelot \u2013 Interview met Oliver Palotai en Thomas Youngblood nav hun nieuwe album \"Haven\" | first = Mario | last = van Os | website = Progwereld.org | language = nl | location = [[Amsterdam]] | quote = Mijn favoriete band is waarschijnlijk Opeth.
