The band was formed by guitarist Eddie Reyes and bassist [[Jesse Lacey]] in 1999. The band's members currently are [[Adam Lazzara]] (lead vocals), [[John Nolan (musician)|John Nolan]] (lead guitar, keyboards, vocals), [[Shaun Cooper (musician)|Shaun Cooper]] (bass guitar) and Mark O'Connell (drums), accompanied by Nathan Cogan (guitar) for their live performances. Among the band's former members include Lacey, Reyes and guitarist and vocalist [[Fred Mascherino]].\n\nLazzara replaced original vocalist Antonio Longo prior to the release of the band's 2002 debut album ''[[Tell All Your Friends]].'' Nolan and Cooper left the band in 2003 to form [[Straylight Run]] before returning in 2010. The band's breakthrough album, 2006's ''[[Louder Now]]'', featured the popular lead single \"[[MakeDamnSure]]\", sold over 900,000 copies, and peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the United States [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], surpassing the band's previous Billboard 200 peak in 2004 at No.&nbsp;3 with ''[[Where You Want to Be]]''.\n\nThe band most recently released their seventh album ''[[Tidal Wave (Taking Back Sunday album)|Tidal Wave]]'' in 2016. Lacey quit Taking Back Sunday in 1999 and formed the critically acclaimed rock band [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]] in 2000, with whom Taking Back Sunday would become embroiled in a highly publicized feud.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-08-28|title=Retracing the Brand New and Taking Back Sunday beef|url=https://ontheaside.com/music/retracing-the-brand-new-taking-back-sunday-beef/|access-date=2022-01-28|website=A.Side|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-04-11|title=When your head goes through the windshield: the 10 best moments of the TBS/Brand New feud|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/the_10_best_moments_of_the_taking_back_sunday_brand_new_feud/|access-date=2022-01-28|website=Alternative Press Magazine|language=en}}</ref> Reyes left the band in 2018, leaving Taking Back Sunday without both its founding members.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1999\u20132002)===\nGuitarist Eddie Reyes, who had played in [[The Movielife]], Mind Over Matter and Inside, and guitarist [[Jesse Lacey]] of the Rookie Lot founded Taking Back Sunday in [[Amityville, New York]] in November 1999.<ref name=\"DIYDecade\">{{cite web|author=Jennings, Harriet|date=March 26, 2012|title=Tell All Your Friends - A Decade Under The Influence Of Taking Back Sunday|url=http://diymag.com/archive/tell-all-your-friends-a-decade-under-the-influence-of-taking-back-sunday|access-date=July 17, 2016|work=DIY|publisher=Sonic Media Group}}</ref><ref name=AltPTaste>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/taste_of_tuesday_taking_back_sunday|title=Taste Of Tuesday: Looking back at musical thrills and offstage spills with Taking Back Sunday|work=Alternative Press|author=Tatone, Jenny|date=April 19, 2016|access-date=July 16, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821154718/http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/taste_of_tuesday_taking_back_sunday|archive-date=August 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Lacey moved to bass with the addition of guitarist [[John Nolan (musician)|John Nolan]].
