The infobox is there to include additional occupations.--> who is credited as a pioneer and influence by musicians across a range of genres that include [[rhythm and blues]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[funk]] and [[jazz]]. A virtual [[one-man band]], Wonder's use of [[synthesizer]]s and other [[electronic musical instrument]]s during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. He also helped drive the genre into the [[album era]], crafting his [[LP record|LPs]] as cohesive, consistent socially conscious statements with complex compositions. [[Visual impairment|Blind]] since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a [[child prodigy]] who signed with [[Motown]]'s [[Tamla]] label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name '''Little Stevie Wonder'''.\n\nWonder's single \"[[Fingertips]]\" was a No. 1 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1963, at the age of 13, making him the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Age records|youngest artist ever]] to top the chart. Wonder's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His \"classic period\" began in 1972 with the releases of ''[[Music of My Mind]]'' and ''[[Talking Book]]'', the latter featuring \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the [[Clavinet|Hohner Clavinet]] keyboard. His works ''[[Innervisions]]'' (1973), ''[[Fulfillingness' First Finale]]'' (1974) and ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' (1976) all won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], making him the tied-record holder for the most [[Grammy Award records#Most Album of the Year wins|Album of the Year wins]], with three. He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases. Wonder began his \"commercial period\" in the 1980s; he achieved his biggest hits and highest level of fame, had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations (including [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Michael Jackson]]), political impact, and television appearances. Wonder has continued to remain active in music and political causes.\n\nWonder is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], with sales of over 100 million records worldwide. He has won 25 [[Grammy Awards]] (the most by a solo artist) and one [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] ([[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Original Song]], for the 1984 film ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]''). Wonder has been inducted into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame]], [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. He is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s birthday a [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day|federal holiday]] in the U.S. In 2009, he was named a [[United Nations Messengers of Peace|United Nations Messenger of Peace]], and in 2014, he was honored with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].\n\n== Early life ==\nWonder was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins in [[Saginaw, Michigan]], on May 13, 1950,<ref name=\"blindfaith\">{{cite book|first1=Dennis |last1= Love| first2= Stacy| last2= Brown |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2I_vHgAACAAJ |title=Blind Faith: The Miraculous Journey of Lula Hardaway, Stevie Wonder's Mother|publisher= Simon & Schuster|year= 2007| isbn= 978-1-4165-7785-0}}</ref> the third of five children born to [[Lula Mae Hardaway]], and the second of Hardaway's two children with Calvin Judkins.<ref name= \"Ribowski\">Ribowski, Mark (2010).
