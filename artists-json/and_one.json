Jason Ankeny of [[AllMusic]] called their 1990 single, \"Metal Hammer\", a \"significant club hit\".<ref name=allmusic/> The duo became a trio with the addition of Alex Two, prior to the release of their debut album, ''[[Anguish (album)|Anguish]]'' in 1991.  That same year, they were honored as the Best New Artist in western Germany.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IE3yERse7MUC&q=%22and+one%22+%22bodypop%22&pg=PA108 | title=Synthiepop - Die gef\u00fchlvolle K\u00e4lte | language=de | author=Horst, Dirk | publisher=Norderstedt | year=2010 | isbn=9783842334229 | access-date=April 21, 2011 | archive-date=June 9, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210609120719/https://books.google.com/books?id=IE3yERse7MUC&q=%22and+one%22+%22bodypop%22&pg=PA108 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nGoing into the release of ''Anguish'', they had already garnered a decent following through touring and appearances at various parties. With their debut release, they took home the Best New Artist award in Germany in 1991. Chris Ruiz left in 1992 (he would later return in 2001) while Steve Naghavi remained with the band. And One released three more albums with [[Machinery Records]], ''Flop!'' (1992), ''Spot'' (1993) and ''I.S.T.'' (1994). The band left Machinery around 1996\u20131997 and signed to [[Virgin Schallplatten]]. And One would release four albums on this label between 1997 and 2003: ''Nordhausen'' (1997), ''9.9.99 9 Uhr'' (1998), ''Virgin Superstar'' (2000) and ''Aggressor'' (2003).\n\nThe next And One album, ''[[Bodypop]]'', was released on 1 September 2006 by [[Out of Line Music|Out of Line]] in Europe and on 7 November 2006 on [[Metropolis Records]] in the US.
