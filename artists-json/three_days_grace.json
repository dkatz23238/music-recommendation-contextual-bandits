In 2003, [[Barry Stock]] was recruited as the band's lead guitarist, making them a quartet. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by [[My Darkest Days]]' vocalist Matt Walst, the younger brother of Brad Walst.\n\nCurrently signed to [[RCA Records]], they have released seven studio albums, six of which at three-year intervals: ''[[Three Days Grace (album)|Three Days Grace]]'' in 2003, ''[[One-X]]'' in 2006, ''[[Life Starts Now]]'' in 2009, ''[[Transit of Venus (album)|Transit of Venus]]'' in 2012, ''[[Human (Three Days Grace album)|Human]]'' in 2015, and ''[[Outsider (Three Days Grace album)|Outsider]]'' in 2018. Their seventh studio album ''[[Explosions (album)|Explosions]]'' was released on May 6, 2022. The first three albums have been [[RIAA certified]] 2\u00d7 platinum, 3\u00d7 platinum, and platinum, respectively, in the United States. In Canada, they have been [[Music Canada#Certification-awards|certified by Music Canada]] as platinum, triple platinum, and double platinum, respectively. The band has 17 No. 1 songs on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart (tied with [[Shinedown]]), and 3 No. 1 hits on [[Alternative Songs]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== As Groundswell (1992\u20131997) ===\n\nThe band started out as a quintet named \"Groundswell\" in [[Norwood, Ontario|Norwood]], Ontario, in 1992.<ref name=\"allmusic bio\"/> Groundswell released one full-length album, ''Wave of Popular Feeling'' in 1995, containing singles \"Eddie\", \"Poison Ivy\" and \"Stare\".

About this time, Gontier developed an addiction to the prescription [[narcotic analgesic|drug]] [[OxyContin]]. After finishing the tour for their first album, the band knew they could not continue with the condition he was in, so in 2005, with the support of his family, friends, and band members, Gontier checked himself into the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] (CAMH) in Toronto.

The band found a place suitable for further songwriting in [[Northern Ontario]], in a cottage where they experimented on, tested, and practiced new songs. After three months at the cottage, they had about finished what would be their second album. Gontier contributed lyrics about his experiences in rehab; the first single from ''[[One-X]]'', titled \"[[Animal I Have Become]]\", features lyrics Gontier had written while getting sober. The second album contained at least four more such songs, including \"Over and Over\", \"Gone Forever\", and the hit songs \"[[Pain (Three Days Grace song)|Pain]]\" and \"[[Never Too Late (Three Days Grace song)|Never Too Late]]\". In a 2006 interview, Gontier said that the album's material was more personal to him than the band's previous work because the inspiration had come out of his experiences with despondence, drug abuse, and rehab, which had constituted the past two years of his life.<ref name=revolver>{{cite journal |last=Kelley |first=Trevor |date=January 2007 |title=Three Days Grace |journal=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |issue=52 |pages=46\u201348 |issn=1527-408X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPoDAAAAMBAJ |access-date=August 13, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name=msnbc>{{cite news | title=Three Days Grace Singer Feels the Pain |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/three-days-grace-singer-feels-pain-wbna13106824 |publisher=[[Today.com]] |date=June 2, 2006 |access-date=August 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''One-X'' was released on June 13, 2006<ref name=msnbc /> and marked [[Barry Stock]]'s first effort with the band.<ref name=\"allmusic bio\" /> Gontier also performed live by himself at various rehabilitation centres as a \"thank you\" to the people who had helped him get through his addiction, and as an inspiration to others who were also dealing with addiction issues. In these performances, he would play songs such as \"Pain\", \"Animal I Have Become\", and \"Never Too Late\", to encourage and motivate people under treatment to overcome their addiction. Most, if not all, of these solo acoustic performances, called the \"Three Days to Change\" tour, took place simultaneously as Three Days Grace toured promoting ''One-X''. In November 2006, Gontier performed with the band at a special show at the CAMH in Toronto, where he had gone for his own rehab. The audience of about 250 people included patients, radio contest winners, family and friends of the band, and representatives from the band's label. Following the performance, Gontier did a 50-minute Q&A session which was filmed as part of the \"Behind the Pain\" documentary.<ref name=behind-the-pain>{{cite news|author=Bliss, Karen|title=3DG doc aims to help addicts|work=JAM!
