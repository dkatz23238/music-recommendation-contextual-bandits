Since the summer of 2006, J\u00f3nsi has been using a guitar that was made on the road by his then guitar tech Dan Johnson. The guitar is usually referred to as \"The Bird\", after the band's bird designs seen on previous album artwork that adorn the neck and frets of the guitar. \"The Bird\" is based on the body of the Ibanez PF200. The artist has also been seen playing a variety of other instruments such as the piano, acoustic guitar, electric bass guitar, harmonium, mellotron, baritone ukulele, and the banjo.\n\n==Activism==\nIn 2003, he was escorted off the premises while protesting against [[K\u00e1rahnj\u00fakar Hydropower Plant]] in Iceland.<ref name=\"sigur-ros.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/news/?m=200301 |title=Sigur R\u00f3s Official Site |date= January 2003|access-date=19 November 2008}}</ref>\n\nJ\u00f3nsi is a vegetarian.
