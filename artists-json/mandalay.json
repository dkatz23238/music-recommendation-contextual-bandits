Located on the east bank of the [[Irrawaddy River]], 631km (392 miles) (Road Distance) north of Yangon, the city has a population of 1,225,553 (2014 census).\n\nMandalay was founded in 1857 by King [[Mindon Min|Mindon]], replacing [[Amarapura]] as the new royal capital of the [[Konbaung dynasty]]. It was Burma's final royal capital before the kingdom's annexation by the [[British Empire]] in 1885. Under British rule, Mandalay remained commercially and culturally important despite the rise of Yangon, the new capital of British Burma. The city suffered extensive destruction during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. In 1948, Mandalay became part of the newly independent Union of Burma.\n\nToday, Mandalay is the economic centre of [[Upper Myanmar]] and considered the centre of Burmese culture. A continuing influx of illegal [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] immigrants, mostly from [[Yunnan]], since the late 20th century, has reshaped the city's ethnic makeup and increased commerce with China.<ref name=iiss/><ref name=jt/>{{dead link|date=August 2020}} Despite [[Naypyidaw]]'s recent rise, Mandalay remains Upper Myanmar's main commercial, educational and health center.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe city gets its name from the nearby [[Mandalay Hill]].

Between the two World Wars, the city was Upper Burma's focal point in a series of nationwide protests against the British rule. The British rule brought in many immigrants from India to the city.

On 3 April 1942, during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] carried out an extensive assault. The city was in effect defenseless as its firefighting resources were weak, having been lost in earlier bombing, it had no anti-aircraft capacity, and the British [[RAF]] had by now withdrawn all its aircraft to India. Three-fifths of Mandalay's houses were destroyed and 2,000 civilians were killed.<ref>[http://history.howstuffworks.com/world-war-ii/axis-conquers-philippines9.htm The Axis Conquers the Philippines: January 1942 \u2013 July 1942] ''history.howstuffworks.com'', accessed 21 March 2021</ref><ref>[http://www.worldwar-2.net/timelines/asia-and-the-pacific/asian-mainland/asian-mainland-index-1942.htm World War II net] ''www.worldwar-2.net'', accessed 21 March 2021</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cghbp0WbhxAC&q=Japanese+bombing+of+Rangoon+civilians&pg=PA41 |title=The British Empire and the Second World War |first=Ashley |last=Jackson |date=10 May 2006 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Academic]] |pages=41 |isbn=9781852854171}}</ref> Many residents also fled when the city was under [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] occupation from May 1942 to March 1945. The palace citadel, which had been turned into a supply depot by the Japanese, was in turn burnt to the ground by Allied bombing; only the royal [[mint (coin)|mint]] and the watch tower survived. (A faithful replica of the palace was rebuilt in the 1990s.)\n\n===Contemporary Mandalay (1948\u2013present)===\nAfter the country gained independence from Britain in 1948, Mandalay continued to be the main cultural, educational and economic hub of Upper Burma. Until the early 1990s, most students from Upper Burma went to Mandalay for university education. Until 1991, [[Mandalay University]], the [[University of Medicine, Mandalay]] and the [[Defence Services Academy]] were the only three universities in Upper Burma. Only a few other cities had \"Degree Colleges\" affiliated with Mandalay University that offered a limited number of subjects. Today, the city attracts a fraction of students as the military government requires students to attend their local universities in order to reduce concentration of students in one place.\n\nIn November 1959, Mandalay celebrated its centennial with a festival at the foot of Mandalay Hill.

Monastery]]:  The \"Atumashi [[kyaung]]\", <button >which</button> literally means \"inimitable [[vihara]]\", is also one of the well known sights. The original structure was destroyed by a fire in 1890 though the masonry plinth survived. The reconstruction project was started by the government on 2 May 1995 and completed in June 1996.\n* [[Buddha's Replica Tooth Relic Pagoda]]:  One of the Buddha's Sacred Replica Tooth Relics was enshrined in the Mandalay Swedaw Pagoda on Maha Dhammayanthi Hill in [[Amarapura]] Township. The pagoda was built with cash donations contributed by the peoples of Burma and Buddhist donors from around the world under the supervision of the State Peace and Development Council. The authorities and donors hoisted Buddha's Replica Tooth Relic Pagoda Mandalay's ''Shwe Htidaw'' (sacred golden umbrella), ''Hngetmyatnadaw'' (sacred bird perch vane) and ''Seinhpudaw'' (sacred diamond bud) on 13 December 1996.\n* [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] (The World's Biggest Book):  Built by King Mindon in 1857, this pagoda modeled on the [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] at [[Nyaung-U]], is surrounded by 729 upright stone slabs on which are inscribed the entire ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka|Tipi\u1e6daka]]'' as edited and approved by the [[Fifth Buddhist council]]. It is popularly known as \"[[World's largest book]]\" for its stone scriptures.\n* [[Kyauktawgyi Buddha Temple (Mandalay)|Kyauktawgyi Pagoda]]: Near the southern approach to Mandalay Hill stands the Kyauktawgyi Buddha image built by King Mindon in 1853\u201378. The Image was carved out of a huge single block of marble. Statues of 80 [[arhat|arahants]] are assembled around the Image, twenty on each side. The carving was completed in 1865.\n* [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple]]: The image of Gautama Buddha at Mahamuni Buddha Temple is said to have been cast in the life-time of the Gautama Buddha and that the Buddha embraced it seven times, thereby bringing it to life. Consequently, devout Buddhists hold it to be alive and refer to it as the Mahamuni Sacred Living Image. Revered as the holiest pagoda in Mandalay, It was built by King [[Bodawpaya]] in 1784. The image in a sitting posture is 12&nbsp;feet and 7&nbsp;inches (3.8&nbsp;m) high. As the image was brought from [[Rakhine State]], it was also called the Great Rakhine Buddha. The early morning ritual of washing the Face of Buddha Image draws a large crowd of devotees every day. The Great Image is also considered {{by whom|date=May 2019}} as the greatest in Burma next to [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. \n* [[Mandalay Hill]]:  The hill has for long been a holy mount. Legend has it that the Buddha, on his visit, had prophesied that a great city would be founded at its foot. Mandalay Hill, 230&nbsp;metres high, provides a view of the city and surrounding countryside. The construction of a motor road to reach the hill-top has already been finished.\n* [[Mandalay Palace]]:  The whole palace complex was destroyed by a fire during World War II. The palace walls, the city gates with their crowning wooden pavilions and the surrounding moat, \"Mya-nan-san-kyaw Shwenandaw\", were rebuilt using forced labor. A model of the Mandalay Palace, Nanmyint-saung and [[Mandalay Cultural Museum]] are located inside the Palace grounds.\n* [[Shwenandaw Monastery]]: known for its wood carvings, it was a part of the old palace. In 1880 it was moved by King Thibaw to its current site close to Atumashi Monastery.\n*[[U Bein Bridge]] : known for the oldest and (once) longest teakwood bridge in the world. It was constructed when the capital of Ava Kingdom moved to Amarapura .\n* [[Yadanabon Zoological Gardens]]: A small zoo between the [[Mandalay Palace]] and [[Mandalay Hill]]. It has over 300 species and is notably the only zoo to have [[Burmese roofed turtle]]s.\n\n[[File:Eastern walkway Mandalay.jpg|thumb|Eastern walkway of Mandalay moat]]\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Headquater of MCDC.jpg|thumb|Mandalay City Hall and MCDC Headquarter]]\nThe [[Mandalay Region Government]] is the government for Mandalay Region including Mandalay City.

In 2018, as part of Mandalay Smart City initiatives, new traffic lights with internet-connected sensors have been installed by Mandalay City Development Committee to manage traffic at junctions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mmtimes.com/news/mandalays-challenging-road-becoming-smart-city.html |title=Mandalay's challenging road to becoming a smart city |website=www.mmtimes.com |date=19 November 2018 |access-date=21 March 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations|type=Burma\n| 1950|167000\n| 1960|250000\n| 1970|374000\n| 1980|499000\n| 1990|636000\n| 2000|810000\n| 2007|961000\n| 2010|1034000\n| footnote = <ref name=un>{{Cite web |url=http://esa.un.org/unup/index.asp?panel=2 |title=United Nations World Urbanization Prospects, 2007 revision |access-date=24 January 2009 |publisher=The United Nations Population Division |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218103032/http://esa.un.org/unup/index.asp?panel=2 |archive-date=18 December 2008}}</ref>\n}}\n\nA 2007 estimate by the UN puts Mandalay's population at nearly 1 million.
