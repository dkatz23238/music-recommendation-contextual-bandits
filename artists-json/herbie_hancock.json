He shortly thereafter joined the [[Miles Davis Quintet]], where he helped to redefine the role of a jazz [[rhythm section]] and was one of the primary architects of the [[post-bop]] sound. In the 1970s, Hancock experimented with [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], and [[electro-funk|electro]] styles, utilizing a wide array of [[synthesizers]] and electronics. It was during this period that he released perhaps his best-known and most influential album, ''[[Head Hunters]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/herbie-hancock-head-hunters/|title=Herbie Hancock: Head Hunters Album Review|date=5 April 2020|last=Larson|first=Jeremy D.|work=Pitchfork|access-date=29 September 2021}}</ref>\n\nHancock's best-known compositions include \"[[Cantaloupe Island]]\", \"[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]\", \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\", and \"[[Chameleon (composition)|Chameleon]]\", all of which are [[jazz standard]]s. During the 1980s, he enjoyed a hit single with the electronic instrumental \"[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]\", a collaboration with bassist/producer [[Bill Laswell]]. His 2007 [[Joni Mitchell]] tribute album ''[[River: The Joni Letters]]'' won the 2008 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], only the second jazz album to win the award after ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'' in 1965.\n\nSince 2012, Hancock has served as a professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he teaches at the [[UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music]].<ref name=\"schoolofmusic.ucla.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/people/herbie-hancock/|title=Herbie Hancock|website=The UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music|access-date=June 24, 2020|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116192102/https://schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/people/herbie-hancock/|url-status=live}}</ref> He is also the chairman of the [[Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz]]<ref name=\"schoolofmusic.ucla.edu\"/> (formerly known as the [[Thelonious Monk]] Institute of Jazz until 2019).\n\n== Early life ==\nHancock was born in [[Chicago]], the son of Winnie Belle (n\u00e9e Griffin), a secretary, and Wayman Edward Hancock, a government meat inspector.

The pianist quickly earned a reputation, and played subsequent sessions with [[Oliver Nelson]] and [[Phil Woods]].\n\nHe recorded his first solo album ''[[Takin' Off]]'' for [[Blue Note Records]] in 1962. \"[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]\" (from ''Takin' Off'') was to provide [[Mongo Santamar\u00eda]] with a hit single, but more importantly for Hancock, ''Takin' Off'' caught the attention of [[Miles Davis]], who was at that time assembling a new band. Hancock was introduced to Davis by the young drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]], a member of the new band.\n\n==Career==\n=== Miles Davis Quintet (1963\u20131968) and Blue Note Records (1962\u20131969) ===\nHancock received considerable attention when, in May 1963,<ref name=\"grove\" /> he joined Davis's [[Miles Davis Quintet#Second Great Quintet (1964\u201368)|Second Great Quintet]]. Davis personally sought out Hancock, whom he saw as one of the most promising talents in jazz. The [[rhythm section]] Davis organized was young but effective, comprising bassist [[Ron Carter]], 17-year-old drummer Williams, and Hancock on piano. After [[George Coleman]] and [[Sam Rivers (jazz musician)|Sam Rivers]] each took a turn at the saxophone spot, the quintet gelled with [[Wayne Shorter]] on tenor saxophone. This quintet is often regarded as one of the finest jazz ensembles<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/oct/13/miles-davis-second-great-quintet 50 great moments in jazz: How Miles Davis's second quintet changed jazz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116192054/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/oct/13/miles-davis-second-great-quintet |date=November 16, 2020 }}, theguardian.com</ref> yet.\n\nWhile in Davis's band, Hancock also found time to record dozens of sessions for the Blue Note label, both under his own name and as a [[sideman]] with other musicians such as Shorter, Williams, [[Grant Green]], [[Bobby Hutcherson]], Rivers, Byrd, [[Kenny Dorham]], [[Hank Mobley]], [[Lee Morgan]], [[Freddie Hubbard]], and [[Eric Dolphy]].\n\nHancock also recorded several less-well-known but still critically acclaimed albums with larger ensembles \u2013 ''[[My Point of View]]'' (1963), ''[[Speak Like a Child (album)|Speak Like a Child]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Prisoner (album)|The Prisoner]]'' (1969), albums which featured [[flugelhorn]], [[alto flute]] and [[bass trombone]] in addition to the traditional jazz instrumentation. 1963's ''[[Inventions and Dimensions]]'' was an album of almost entirely improvised music, teaming Hancock with bassist [[Paul Chambers]] and two Latin percussionists, [[Willie Bobo]] and Osvaldo \"Chihuahua\" Martinez.\n\nDuring this period, Hancock also composed the [[Film scores|score]] to [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s film ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966), the first of many [[film soundtrack]]s he recorded in his career. As well as feature film soundtracks, Hancock recorded a number of musical themes used on American television commercials for such then-well-known products as [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]]'s [[Space Food Sticks]], [[Standard Oil]], [[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] diet cola and [[Virginia Slims]] cigarettes. Hancock also wrote, arranged and conducted a spy type theme for a series of [[F. William Free]] commercials for Silva Thins cigarettes. Hancock liked it so much he wished to record it as a song but the ad agency would not let him. He rewrote the harmony, tempo and tone and recorded the piece as the track \"He Who Lives in Fear\" from his ''The Prisoner'' album of 1969.<ref>Hancock, Herbie & Dickey, Lisa  ''Herbie Hancock: Possibilities'' Penguin, October 23, 2014</ref>\n\nDavis had begun incorporating elements of rock and popular music into his recordings by the end of Hancock's tenure with the band. Despite some initial reluctance, Hancock began doubling on electric [[Keyboard instruments|keyboards]], including the [[Fender Rhodes]] [[electric piano]] at Davis's insistence. Hancock adapted quickly to the new instruments, which proved to be important in his future artistic endeavors.\n\nUnder the pretext that he had returned late from a honeymoon in Brazil, Hancock was dismissed from Davis's band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/herbie-hancock-too-good-to-be-true-422113.html|title=Herbie Hancock: Too good to be true|date=October 23, 2011|website=The Independent}}</ref> In the summer of 1968 Hancock formed his own sextet. However, although Davis soon disbanded his quintet to search for a new sound, Hancock, despite his departure from the working band, continued to appear on Davis records for the next few years. Appearances included ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', ''[[A Tribute to Jack Johnson]]'' and ''[[On the Corner]]''.\n\n=== ''Fat Albert'' (1969) and Mwandishi era (1971\u20131973) ===\n[[File:Herbie hancock 1970.png|thumb|Hancock {{circa}} 1970]]\nHancock left Blue Note in 1969, signing with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. In 1969, Hancock composed the soundtrack for [[Bill Cosby]]'s animated prime-time television special ''[[Hey, Hey, Hey, It's Fat Albert]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497624/fullcredits|title=Hey, Hey, Hey, It's Fat Albert (TV Movie 1969)|via=www.imdb.com|access-date=July 1, 2018|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116192107/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497624/fullcredits|url-status=live}}</ref> Music from the soundtrack was later included on ''[[Fat Albert Rotunda]]'' (1969), an [[R&B]]-inspired album with strong jazz overtones. One of the jazzier songs on the record, the moody ballad \"Tell Me a Bedtime Story\", was later re-worked as a more electronic sounding song for the [[Quincy Jones]] album ''[[Sounds...and Stuff Like That!!]]'' (1978).\n\nHancock became fascinated with electronic musical instruments. Together with the profound influence of Davis's ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970), this fascination culminated in a series of albums in which electronic instruments were coupled with acoustic instruments.\n\nHancock's first ventures into [[electronic music]] started with a sextet comprising Hancock, bassist [[Buster Williams]] and drummer [[Billy Hart]], and a trio of horn players: [[Eddie Henderson (musician)|Eddie Henderson]] (trumpet), [[Julian Priester]] ([[trombone]]), and [[multireedist]] [[Bennie Maupin]]. [[Patrick Gleeson]] was eventually added to the mix to play and program the synthesizers.\n\nThe sextet, later a septet with the addition of Gleeson, made three albums under Hancock's name: ''[[Mwandishi]]'' (1971), ''[[Crossings (Herbie Hancock album)|Crossings]]'' (1972) (both on Warner Bros. Records), and ''[[Sextant (album)|Sextant]]'' (1973) (released on [[Columbia Records]]); two more, ''[[Realization (album)|Realization]]'' and ''[[Inside Out (Eddie Henderson album)|Inside Out]]'', were recorded under Henderson's name with essentially the same personnel. The music exhibited strong improvisational aspect beyond the confines of jazz mainstream and showed influence from the electronic music of [[contemporary music|contemporary classical]] composers.\n\nHancock's three records released in 1971\u201373 later became known as the \"Mwandishi\" albums, so-called after a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] name Hancock sometimes used during this era (\"''Mwandishi''\" is [[Swahili language|Swahili]] for \"writer\"). The first two, including ''[[Fat Albert Rotunda]]'' were made available on the 2-CD set ''Mwandishi: the Complete Warner Bros. Recordings'', released in 1994. \"Hornets\" was later revised on the 2001 album ''[[Future2Future]]'' as \"Virtual Hornets\".\n\nAmong the instruments Hancock and Gleeson used were [[Fender Rhodes]] piano, [[ARP Odyssey]], [[ARP 2600]], [[ARP Pro Soloist]] Synthesizer, a [[Mellotron]] and the [[Moog synthesizer]] III.\n\n=== From ''Head Hunters'' (1973) to ''Secrets'' (1976) ===\n{{See also|Head Hunters}}\n[[File:Herbie Hancock and The Headhunters 1975.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Hancock (left) with the Headhunters]]\n\nHancock formed [[The Headhunters]], keeping only Maupin from the sextet and adding bassist [[Paul Jackson (bassist)|Paul Jackson]], percussionist [[Bill Summers (musician)|Bill Summers]], and drummer [[Harvey Mason]]. The album ''[[Head Hunters (album)|Head Hunters]]'' (1973) was a hit, crossing over to pop audiences but criticized within his jazz audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thevinylfactory.com/features/electric-herbie-15-essential-funk-era-herbie-hancock-records/|work=thevinylfactory.com|title=Electric Herbie: 15 essential funk-era Herbie Hancock records|author=Anton Spice|date=September 25, 2014|access-date=January 25, 2019|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116192058/https://thevinylfactory.com/features/electric-herbie-15-essential-funk-era-herbie-hancock-records/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Stephen Erlewine]], in a retrospective summary for [[AllMusic]], said, \"''Head Hunters'' still sounds fresh and vital three decades after its initial release, and its genre-bending proved vastly influential on not only jazz, but funk, soul, and hip-hop.\"<ref name=\"Headhunters ''Allmusic'' review\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic |class=album |id=r140166/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Headhunters Herbie Hancock|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|year=2010|work=Allmusic review of Headhunters|access-date=July 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDrummer Mason was replaced by [[Mike Clark (jazz musician)|Mike Clark]], and the band released a second album, ''[[Thrust (album)|Thrust]]'', the following year, 1974. (A live album from a Japan performance, consisting of compositions from those first two ''Head Hunters'' releases was released in 1975 as ''[[Flood (Herbie Hancock album)|Flood]]''). This was almost as well received as its predecessor, if not attaining the same level of commercial success. The Headhunters made another successful album called ''[[Survival of the Fittest (The Headhunters album)|Survival of the Fittest]]'' in 1975 without Hancock, while Hancock himself started to make even more commercial albums, often featuring members of the band, but no longer billed as The Headhunters. The Headhunters reunited with Hancock in 1998 for ''Return of the Headhunters'', and a version of the band (featuring Jackson and Clark) continues to play and record.\n\nIn 1973, Hancock composed his soundtrack to the controversial film ''[[The Spook Who Sat by the Door (film)|The Spook Who Sat by the Door]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Herbie-Hancock-The-Spook-Who-Sat-By-The-Door/release/635602|title=Herbie Hancock \u2013 The Spook Who Sat By The Door|website=discogs|access-date=September 22, 2020|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116192035/https://www.discogs.com/Herbie-Hancock-The-Spook-Who-Sat-By-The-Door/release/635602|url-status=live}}</ref> Then in 1974, he composed the soundtrack to the first ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'' film. One of his memorable songs, \"Joanna's Theme\", was re-recorded in 1997 on his duet album with Shorter, ''[[1+1 (Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter album)|1+1]]''.\n\nHancock's next jazz-funk albums of the 1970s were ''[[Man-Child]]'' (1975) and ''[[Secrets (Herbie Hancock album)|Secrets]]'' (1976), which point toward the more commercial direction Hancock would take over the next decade. These albums feature the members of the Headhunters band, but also a variety of other musicians in important roles.\n\n=== From ''V.S.O.P.'' (1976) to ''Future Shock'' (1983) ===\n[[File:Herbie Hancock 1976.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Hancock in 1976]]\nIn 1978, Hancock recorded a duet with [[Chick Corea]], who replaced him in the Davis band a decade earlier. Hancock also released a solo acoustic piano album, ''[[The Piano (Herbie Hancock album)|The Piano]]'' (1979), which was released only in Japan. (It was released in the US in 2004). Other Japan-only albums include ''[[Dedication (Herbie Hancock album)|Dedication]]'' (1974), ''[[VSOP: Tempest in the Colosseum|V.S.O.P.'s Tempest in the Colosseum]]'' (1977), and ''[[Direct Step]]'' (1978). ''[[VSOP: Live Under the Sky]]'' was a VSOP album remastered for the US in 2004 and included a second concert from the tour in July 1979.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1982, Hancock recorded many albums of jazz-inflected [[disco]] and pop music, beginning with ''[[Sunlight (jazz album)|Sunlight]]'' (featuring guest musicians including Williams and Pastorius on the last track) (1978). Singing through a [[vocoder]], he earned a British hit,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=2006 |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |edition=19th |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |location=London |isbn=1-904994-10-5 |page=242}}</ref> \"I Thought It Was You\", although critics were unimpressed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warr.org/hancock.html |title=Herbie Hancock |publisher=Warr.org |access-date=October 22, 2011 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116192130/http://www.warr.org/hancock.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This led to more vocoder on his next album, ''[[Feets, Don't Fail Me Now]]'' (1979), which gave him another UK hit in \"You Bet Your Love\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" />\n\nHancock toured with Williams and Carter in 1981, recording ''[[Herbie Hancock Trio (1982 album)|Herbie Hancock Trio]]'', a five-track album released only in Japan. A month later, he recorded ''[[Quartet (Herbie Hancock album)|Quartet]]'' with trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]], released in the US the following year. Hancock, Williams, and Carter toured internationally with Wynton Marsalis and his brother, saxophonist [[Branford Marsalis]], in what was known as \"VSOP II\". This quintet can be heard on Wynton Marsalis's debut album on Columbia (1981). In 1984 VSOP II performed at the Playboy Jazz Festival as a sextet with Hancock, Williams, Carter, the Marsalis Brothers, and [[Bobby McFerrin]].\n\nIn 1982, Hancock contributed to the album ''[[New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)]]'' by [[Simple Minds]], playing a synthesizer solo on the track \"Hunter and the Hunted\".\n\nIn 1983, Hancock had a pop hit with the Grammy Award-winning single \"[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]\" from the album ''[[Future Shock (Herbie Hancock album)|Future Shock]]''.

This single ushered in a collaboration with noted bassist and producer [[Bill Laswell]]. Hancock experimented with electronic music on a string of three LPs produced by Laswell: ''Future Shock'' (1983), the Grammy Award-winning ''[[Sound-System (album)|Sound-System]]'' (1984), and ''[[Perfect Machine (album)|Perfect Machine]]'' (1988).\n\nDuring this period, he appeared onstage at the [[Grammy Awards]] with [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]], and [[Thomas Dolby]], in a synthesizer [[Jam band|jam]]. Lesser known works from the 1980s are the live album ''[[Jazz Africa]]'' (1987) and the studio album ''[[Village Life (album)|Village Life]]'' (1984), which were recorded with [[Gambia]]n [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] player [[Foday Musa Suso]]. Also, in 1985 Hancock performed as a guest on the album ''[[So Red the Rose]]'' (1985) by the [[Duran Duran]] spinoff group [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]]. He also provided introductory and closing comments for the [[PBS]] rebroadcast in the United States of the [[BBC]] educational series from the mid-1980s, ''[[Rockschool]]'' (not to be confused with the most recent ''Gene Simmons' Rock School'' series).\n\nIn 1986, Hancock performed and acted in the film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|'Round Midnight]]''. He also wrote the score/soundtrack, for which he won an [[Academy Award for Original Music Score]]. His film work was prolific during the 1980s, and included the scores to ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'' (1984), ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]'' (1986), ''[[Action Jackson (1988 film)|Action Jackson]]'' (1988 with [[Michael Kamen]]), ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'' (1988), and the [[Eddie Murphy]] comedy ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' (1989). Often he would also write music for TV commercials. \"Maiden Voyage\", in fact, started out as a cologne advertisement. At the end of the ''Perfect Machine'' tour, Hancock decided to leave Columbia Records after a 15-plus-year relationship.\n\n=== 1990s to 2000 ===\n[[File:Herbie Hancock-Chameleon Live.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hancock live in concert]]\nAfter a break following his departure from Columbia, Hancock, together with Carter, Williams, Shorter, and Davis admirer [[Wallace Roney]], recorded ''[[A Tribute to Miles]]'', which was released in 1994. The album contained two live recordings and studio recording songs, with Roney playing Davis's part as trumpet player. The album won a Grammy for best group album. Hancock also toured with [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Dave Holland]] and [[Pat Metheny]] in 1990 on their ''[[Parallel Realities]]'' tour, which included a performance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in July 1990, and scored the 1991 comedy film ''[[Livin' Large]]'', which starred [[Terrence C. Carson]].\n\nHancock's next album, ''[[Dis Is da Drum]]'', released in 1994, saw him return to [[acid jazz]]. Also in 1994, he appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool]]''. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as \"Album of the Year\" by ''[[Time Magazine]]''.\n\n1995's ''[[The New Standard (Herbie Hancock album)|The New Standard]]'' found Hancock and an all-star band including [[John Scofield]], DeJohnette and [[Michael Brecker]], interpreting pop songs by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[the Beatles]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and others.\n\nA 1997 duet album with Shorter, entitled ''1+1'', was successful; the song \"Aung San Suu Kyi\" winning the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. Hancock also achieved great success in 1998 with his album ''[[Gershwin's World]]'', which featured readings of [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] standards by Hancock and a plethora of guest stars, including Wonder, [[Joni Mitchell]] and Shorter. Hancock toured the world in support of ''Gershwin's World'' with a sextet that featured [[Cyro Baptista]], [[Terri Lynne Carrington]], [[Ira Coleman]], [[Eli Degibri]] and [[Eddie Henderson (musician)|Eddie Henderson]].\n\n=== 2000 to 2009 ===\nIn 2001, Hancock recorded ''[[Future2Future]]'', which reunited Hancock with Laswell and featured doses of [[electronica]] as well as [[turntablist]] [[Rob Swift]] of [[The X-Ecutioners]]. Hancock later toured with the band, and released a concert DVD with a different lineup, which also included the \"Rockit\" music video. Also in 2001 Hancock partnered with Brecker and [[Roy Hargrove]] to record a live concert album saluting Davis and [[John Coltrane]], entitled ''[[Directions in Music: Live at Massey Hall]]'', recorded live in Toronto. The threesome toured to support the album, and toured on-and-off through 2005.\n\n[[File:Herbie Hancock 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Hancock performing in concert, 2006]]\nThe year 2005 saw the release of a duet album called ''[[Possibilities]]''. It featured duets with [[Carlos Santana]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[John Mayer]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and others. In 2006, ''Possibilities'' was nominated for Grammy Awards in two categories: \"A Song for You\" (featuring Aguilera) was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]], and \"Gelo No Montanha\" (featuring [[Trey Anastasio]] on guitar) was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Performance]], although neither nomination resulted in an award.\n\nAlso in 2005, Hancock toured Europe with a new quartet that included [[Benin]]ese guitarist [[Lionel Loueke]], and explored textures ranging from [[ambient music|ambient]] to straight jazz to [[African music]]. Plus, during the summer of 2005, Hancock re-staffed the Headhunters and went on tour with them, including a performance at The [[Bonnaroo]] Music & Arts Festival. This lineup did not consist of any of the original Headhunters musicians. The group included [[Marcus Miller]], Carrington, Loueke and Mayer. Hancock also served as the first artist in residence for Bonnaroo that summer.\n[[File:Herbie Hancock.jpg|thumb|Hancock playing a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] AX-7 [[keytar]], at [[The Roundhouse]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], London, 2006]]\nAlso in 2006, [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]] (which bought out Hancock's old label, Columbia Records) released the two-disc retrospective ''[[The Essential Herbie Hancock]]''. This set was the first compilation of his work at Warner Bros., Blue Note, Columbia and [[Verve Records|Verve]]/[[Polygram Records|Polygram]]. This became Hancock's second major compilation of work since the 2002 Columbia-only ''The Herbie Hancock Box'', which was released at first in a plastic 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;4 cube then re-released in 2004 in a long box set. Also in 2006, Hancock recorded a new song with [[Josh Groban]] and Eric Mouquet (co-founder of [[Deep Forest]]), entitled \"Machine\". It is featured on Groban's CD ''[[Awake (Josh Groban album)|Awake]]''. Hancock also recorded and improvised with guitarist Loueke on Loueke's 1996 debut album ''Virgin Forest'', on the [[ObliqSound]] label, resulting in two improvisational tracks \u2013 \"Le R\u00e9veil des agneaux (The Awakening of the Lambs)\" and \"La Poursuite du lion (The Lion's Pursuit)\".\n\nHancock, a longtime associate and friend of Mitchell, released a 2007 album, ''[[River: The Joni Letters]]'', that paid tribute to her work, with [[Norah Jones]] and [[Tina Turner]] adding vocals to the album,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/hancock.html |title=Key figure: An interview with jazz legend Herbie Hancock |author=Andre Mayer |date=June 18, 2007 |access-date=September 11, 2007 |work=CBC News}}</ref> as did [[Corinne Bailey Rae]].
