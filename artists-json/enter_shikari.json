They released an EP called ''[[Commit No Nuisance]]'', which featured the tracks \"Perfect Pygmalion\", \"Look Inside\", \"Torch Song\", \"Honesty Box\" and \"Fake\". In 2003, with the addition of guitarist Rory Clewlow, Hybryd became Enter Shikari. The band was named after ''Shikari'', a boat belonging to Reynold's uncle. In a 2011 interview, Rolfe explained that: \"Shikari is a [[Hindi]] word for hunter.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Enter Shikari &#124; Artist Interviews |url=http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304025238/http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |archive-date=4 March 2011 |access-date=12 March 2011 |publisher=Access All Areas}}</ref> After the band's line-up and name change, Reynolds focused his musical efforts on vocals and electronics instead of guitar.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Enter Shikari: Unplugged & Personal |url=https://headlinermagazine.net/headliners/enter-shikari-unplugged-and-personal.html |access-date=13 March 2017 |website=Headliner Magazine}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2003 and 2004, the band released three demo EPs (''[[Nodding Acquaintance]]'', ''Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour'' and ''[[Sorry You're Not a Winner EP|Sorry You're Not a Winner]]'') that were available from their gigs and their website, featuring original versions of some songs that were eventually re-recorded for their debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]''.

For this the first versions of \"Return To Energiser\" and \"Labyrinth\" were recorded. Early versions of \"OK Time for Plan B\" and \"We Can Breathe in Space\" were also recorded around this time but it's unclear if these were destined for the EP. It was at this time that Kerrang!

In mid January 2007, Enter Shikari's first single, \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\", entered the UK singles chart for one week at number 151, on Downloads only (despite its physical formats not being eligible for charts [at the band's request]). This was followed a week later by \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which charted at number 182 on the singles chart (despite its physical formats being ineligible for charts [at the band's request]) and number 146 in the Download Chart. In addition \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\" featured on the [[EA Sports]] video game titles [[NHL 08]] and [[Madden 08]]. Enter Shikari secured a spot on the Gibson/Myspace stage at 2006's [[Download Festival#Download 2006|Download Festival]].\n\nThey also had interviews with popular music press such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and ''[[Rock Sound]]''.

Their album ''[[The Spark (Enter Shikari album)|The Spark]]'' in particular delves more into personal issues within the band, with Reynolds stating in an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', regarding lyrical themes: \"What I was trying to do with this album in marrying the personal and the political is to ensure that human vulnerability is laid bare, and to not be afraid to speak about emotions.\" He elaborates by stating that \"I don\u2019t think I could have done it [writing more personal lyrics] before this record. So much happened over those two years [since the release of their previous album], globally and in my personal life, so before. I was kind of comfortable. I have a very finely attuned cringe muscle, I don't like writing about things that have been written about a thousand times. Some of it is maybe even a self-confidence thing, feeling as though I don't have much to offer in terms of art that helps other people. But seeing as 2015 was the year of hell for me, it wasn't just that I wanted to write a more personal record, I had to.
