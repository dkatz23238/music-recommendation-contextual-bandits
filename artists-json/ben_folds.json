The group's first chart breakthrough came in the UK, when \"Underground\" made the lower reaches of the Top 40, peaking at no. 37.

The concert was complete with pranks staged ahead of time by Folds, including a drunk man falling over the balcony during \"Jesusland\" and a \"suicide attempt\" by Folds at the end. The concert is also notable for featuring a \"guitorchestra\", a group of acoustic guitarists from Nashville who accompanied Folds on some songs, as well as an impromptu ringtone orchestra made up of audience members playing their cellphone's ringtones in unison.

Other new songs include \"Errant Dog\", \"Effington\", \"Bitch Went Nuts\", \"Free Coffee\", and \"Kylie From Connecticut\".

The file contained nine tracks along with a [[PDF]] of supposed cover art, and was a mix of what appeared to be legitimate songs from ''Way to Normal'', pastiches of dry humor and melodramatic pop interwoven with bright, energetic melodies. Folds explained on Triple J radio a few weeks later that in one overnight session in Dublin he and the band had recorded 'fake' versions of songs from the new album.
