The title reflects the two batches of songs she recorded with singer-songwriter and producer [[Howe Gelb]] in 2012. ''Invisible Empire,'' recorded in April, is the melancholic half that deals with her father's death and the theme of mortality, while ''Crescent Moon'', recorded in November 2012, features songs that are more ethereal. These 13 songs formed an album that Tunstall described as \"from the heart,\" inspired by her divorce from [[Luke Bullen]] and her father's passing away.\n\n''Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon'' came out in the United Kingdom on 10 June 2013, while it was released in Germany and Australia on 7 June, in Japan and Canada on 11 June, and 6 August 2013 in the United States. Meanwhile, the lead single, \"[[Feel It All]]\", was released worldwide on 10 June, and its music video premiered on 29 April.\n\nIn its first week of release, the album entered the UK charts at No. 14 and it was a modest commercial success in Europe: it peaked at No. 52 in Belgium, No. 84 in the Netherlands, No. 240 in France, No. 7 in Scotland, and No. 56 in Switzerland.
