Yamamoto left in 1990 and was replaced initially by [[Jason Everman]] and shortly thereafter by [[Ben Shepherd]]. The band dissolved in 1997 and re-formed in 2010. Following Cornell's death in 2017 and a year of uncertainty regarding the band's future, Thayil declared in October 2018 that Soundgarden had disbanded once again, though they did reunite in January 2019 for a one-off concert in tribute to Cornell.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.93x.com/2019/01/22/watch-soundgardens-complete-chris-cornell-tribute-set/|title=Watch Soundgarden's Complete Chris Cornell Tribute Set|website=[[KXXR|93X]]|date=January 22, 2019|access-date=July 19, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe band helped to popularize [[grunge]] music, a style of [[alternative rock]] that developed in the American [[Pacific Northwest]] in the mid-1980s, alongside such Seattle contemporaries as [[Alice in Chains]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. They were the first of a number of grunge bands to sign to the Seattle-based record label [[Sub Pop]], through which they released an [[Extended play|EP]] in both 1987 and 1988. California-based independent label [[SST Records]] released Soundgarden's debut album, ''[[Ultramega OK]]'', which, although it did not sell well nationally, garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for a [[Grammy]] award in 1990. Their second album, ''[[Louder Than Love]]'', was recorded independently, but, after they signed with [[A&M Records]] in 1989 (making them one of the first grunge bands to sign to a major label), the album became their major-label debut. While ''Ultramega OK'' had failed to chart and ''Louder Than Love'' peaked at number 108 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, the band's third album, ''[[Badmotorfinger]]'', buoyed by the success of the singles \"[[Jesus Christ Pose]]\", \"[[Outshined]]\", and \"[[Rusty Cage]]\", reached number 39 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and has been certified double-platinum by the [[RIAA]].\n\nSoundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album ''[[Superunknown]]'', which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and yielded the [[Grammy Award]]-winning singles \"[[Spoonman]]\" and \"[[Black Hole Sun]]\". The band experimented with new sonic textures on their follow-up album ''[[Down on the Upside]]'', which debuted at number 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200 in 1996 and spawned several hit singles of its own, including \"[[Burden in My Hand]]\" and \"[[Blow Up the Outside World]]\". In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction and exhaustion from touring. After more than a decade of working on projects and other bands, they reunited in 2010, and [[Republic Records]] released their sixth and final studio album, ''[[King Animal]]'', two years later.\n\nAs of 2019, Soundgarden had sold more than 14 million records in the United States,<ref name=\"riaa\">{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Soundgarden&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526210337/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Soundgarden&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |title=Gold and Platinum Database Search  |work=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]  |access-date=February 12, 2007}}</ref> and an estimated 30 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/502068/09251998/soundgarden.jhtml |title=Ex-Soundgarden Singer Chris Cornell Plows Ahead With Solo Debut |date=September 25, 1998 |access-date=January 19, 2008 |author=Kaufman, Gil |publisher=[[VH1|VH1.com]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905000455/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/502068/09251998/soundgarden.jhtml |archive-date=September 5, 2009 }}</ref> [[VH1]] ranked Soundgarden at number 14 in their special ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''.<ref name=\"vh1 greatest\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early recordings (1984\u20131988)===\n[[File:Soundgarden (1987 Sub Pop promo photo).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Soundgarden in 1987]]\nSoundgarden's origins began with a band called the Shemps, which performed around Seattle in the early 1980s,<ref name=\"history\">{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Kyle|title=Accidental Revolution|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York|year=2007|isbn=978-0-312-35819-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/accidentalrevolu0000ande/page/112 112\u2013116]|url=https://archive.org/details/accidentalrevolu0000ande/page/112}}</ref> and featured bassist [[Hiro Yamamoto]] and drummer and singer [[Chris Cornell]].
