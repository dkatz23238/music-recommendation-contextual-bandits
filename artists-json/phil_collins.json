He was the drummer and lead singer of the rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and also has a career as a solo performer. Between 1982 and 1990, Collins scored three UK and seven US number-one singles as a solo artist. When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, he had more US top 40 singles than any other artist during the 1980s.<ref name=\"Top\">{{cite news|first=John|last=Anderson|title=Pop Notes|work=Newsday|location=New York|date=7 January 1990}}</ref> His most successful singles from the period include \"[[In the Air Tonight]]\", \"[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]\", \"[[One More Night (Phil Collins song)|One More Night]]\", and \"[[Another Day in Paradise]]\".\n\nBorn and brought up in west London, Collins played drums from the age of five and completed drama school training, which secured him various roles as a child actor, with his first major role, aged 13, as the [[Artful Dodger]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''[[Oliver!]]''. He then pursued a music career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of [[Peter Gabriel]]. Collins began a successful solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of [[soul music]], releasing the albums ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' (1981), ''[[Hello, I Must Be Going! (album)|Hello, I Must Be Going]]'' (1982), ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985) and ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989).

He also  resumed his acting career, appearing in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' and subsequently starring in the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' (1988). In 1996, Collins left Genesis to focus on solo work; this included writing songs for Disney's ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999) for which he received an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[You'll Be in My Heart]]\". He rejoined Genesis for their [[Turn It On Again: The Tour|Turn It On Again Tour]] in 2007.
