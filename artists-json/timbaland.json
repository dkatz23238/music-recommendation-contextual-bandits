Further work on [[Aaliyah]]'s second studio album ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'' (1996) and [[Missy Elliott]]'s debut studio album ''[[Supa Dupa Fly]]'' (1997) made him a prominent producer for R&B and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists. As a rapper he initially released several albums with fellow rapper [[Magoo (rapper)|Magoo]], followed by his debut solo album ''[[Tim's Bio: Life from da Bassment|Tim's Bio]]'' in 1998. In 2002, Timbaland produced the hit single \"[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]\" for [[Justin Timberlake]] and went on to produce most of Timberlake's subsequent LPs, such as ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'' and ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'' along with their respective hit singles.\n\nThe Timbaland-owned imprint label, [[Mosley Music Group]], featured artists such as [[Nelly Furtado]], whose Timbaland-produced album ''[[Loose (Nelly Furtado album)|Loose]]'' (2006) was a commercial and critical success. In 2007, Timbaland released a solo album, ''[[Shock Value (Timbaland album)|Shock Value]]'', which was followed by ''[[Shock Value II]]'' in 2009.

''I'm not a rapper,\" he says dismissively. ''I'm not talking about my scars or my battles.'' Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. ''I'll tell you this,'' Tim says. ''If you get shot and you survive, you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But then they got that burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn!

She and her R&B group, Sista, auditioned for [[DeVante Swing]], a producer and member of the successful R&B act [[Jodeci]]. DeVante signed Sista to his Swing Mob record label and Elliott brought Mosley and Barcliff along with her to New York, where Swing Mob was based. It was DeVante who renamed the young producer Timbaland, after the [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]] brand of construction boots.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Where did timberland get his name from?|url=https://www.answers.com/Q/Where_did_timberland_get_his_name_from|access-date=2021-08-12|website=Answers|language=en}}</ref> He and Magoo became part of SCI Zakys School stable of Swing Mob signees known as \"Da Bassment\" crew, joining artists such as R&B singer [[Ginuwine]], male vocal group [[Playa (band)|Playa]] ([[Smoke E.

Elliott began receiving recognition as a songwriter for artists such as R&B girl group 702 and [[MC Lyte]]. Due to Timbaland's connection with her, he was often contacted to produce remixes of her songs.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 25, 2008|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/9850,213743,2083,22.html|title=Tim's Brio |publisher=[[The Village Voice]]}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1994\u20132005===\nTimbaland began his producing career for [[R&B]] acts. In the early-1990s, he produced a few songs for R&B acts such as [[Jodeci]] and Sista. In 1996, he made his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both [[Aaliyah]]'s second album ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'' and [[Ginuwine]]'s debut album ''[[Ginuwine...the Bachelor]]''. This included the major hit singles \"[[If Your Girl Only Knew]]\" by [[Aaliyah]] and \"[[Pony (Ginuwine song)|Pony]]\" by [[Ginuwine]]. While Timbaland was initially producing for R&B artists, his trademark sound was very much rooted in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] with its fast-paced nature and clear drum breaks. He was taking a hip-hop sound and applying it to R&B, and in this way his sound was instrumental in blurring the distinction between hip-hop and R&B production.<ref>{{cite web|last=Birchmeier |first=Jason |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/timbaland-p218225 |title=Timbaland |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=May 29, 2011}}</ref> In 1997, he fully produced ''[[Supa Dupa Fly]]'', the debut album of [[Missy Elliott]], who had been a childhood friend of Mosley. In this album Timbaland continued with his now trademark electronic production style, but since Missy frequently rapped the music was considered hip-hop. Also in 1997, he released his first album with his partner [[Magoo (rapper)|Magoo]], ''[[Welcome to Our World]]'', also a hip-hop album. In the late 1990s, his hip-hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high-profile hip-hop artists including [[Jay-Z]], [[Nas]], and [[The LOX]]. In 1999, he scored a major hit with Jay-Z and rap group [[UGK]] with the hit \"[[Big Pimpin']]\". He also fully produced Missy's second album in 1999, ''[[Da Real World]]''. During this time,  Timbaland continued to produce primarily for R&B artists. He continued to produce for [[Ginuwine]] and [[Aaliyah]], as well as contributing significantly to albums by [[Xscape (band)|Xscape]], [[Nicole Wray|Nicole]], [[Playa (band)|Playa]], and [[Total (music)|Total]]. He remixed [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s major hit \"[[You Make Me Wanna]]\".
