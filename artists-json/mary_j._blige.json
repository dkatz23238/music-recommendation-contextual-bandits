Later in the year, she recorded the [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]]-penned and produced \"[[Not Gon' Cry]]\", for the soundtrack to the motion picture ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]''. The platinum-selling single rose to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in early 1996. Blige gained her first two Grammy nominations and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|1996 Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for her collaboration with [[Method Man]] on \"[[I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By]]\". Shortly after, Blige was featured on [[Jay-Z]]'s breakthrough single, \"[[Can't Knock the Hustle (Jay-Z song)|Can't Knock the Hustle]]\", from his debut ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1996) and with [[Ghostface Killah]] on \"[[All That I Got Is You]]\" from his debut, ''[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]'', which was also released that year. In addition, Blige co-wrote four songs, provided [[backing vocalist|background vocals]] and was featured prominently on two singles with fellow [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Case Woodard|Case]] on his [[Case (album)|self-titled debut album]] (1996) including the US top 20 hit, \"[[Touch Me, Tease Me]]\", which also featured then up-and-coming rapper [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]].\n\n''What's the 411?''  highlights the featuring of woman centered narratives although in this album her narratives were regularly policed and told through male emcees. Nonetheless, it marked the start of a transition towards black women centered narratives that focused on the daily experiences and troubles of the black experience through the lens of women rather than necessarily singing about black trauma. Treva B. Lindsey, in her piece \"If You Look in My Life: Love, Hip-Hop Soul, and Contemporary African-American Womanhood\", highlights the regulating by men saying, \"Although the lyrics on ''What's the 411?'' establish an African American woman-centered discourse, male artists' words of adoration and longing first introduce listeners to Blige as a hip-hop storyteller. ''What's the 411?'', therefore, functions as an African American woman-centered storytelling space created largely by black men.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lindsey|first=Treva B.|date=2013|title=If You Look in My Life: Love, Hip-Hop Soul, and Contemporary African American Womanhood|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/african_american_review/v046/46.1.lindsey.html|journal=African American Review|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=87\u201399|doi=10.1353/afa.2013.0004|s2cid=161453628|issn=1945-6182}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132000: ''Share My World'' and ''Mary''===\n[[File:Mary J. Blige 1998.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Blige in 1998]]\nOn April 22, 1997, MCA Records (parent company to Uptown Records, which was in the process of being dismantled) released Blige's third album, ''[[Share My World]]''. By then, she and Combs had dissolved their working relationship. In his place were the [[Trackmasters]], who executive-produced the project along with [[Steve Stoute]]. Sharing production duties were producers [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]]. The album was made at a time when Blige was trying to \"get her life together\", by trying to overcome drugs and alcohol, as well as the ending of her relationship with Hailey. After an encounter with a person who threatened her life the previous year, she tried to quit the unhealthy lifestyle and make more upbeat, happier music. As a result, songs such as \"Love Is All We Need\" and \"Share My World\" were made.<!--give source for this info per MoS--> ''Share My World'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned five hit singles: \"Love Is All We Need\" (featuring [[Nas]]), \"I Can Love You\" (featuring [[Lil' Kim]]), \"Everything\", \"Missing You\" (UK only) and \"Seven Days\" (featuring [[George Benson]]). In February 1997, Blige performed her hit at the time, \"[[Not Gon' Cry]]\", at the [[1997 Grammy Awards]], which gained her a third Grammy Award nomination, her first for [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]], as Blige was recording the follow-up to ''My Life''. In early 1998, Blige won an American Music Award for \"Favorite Soul/R&B Album\". That summer, she embarked on the Share My World Tour, which resulted in a Gold-certified [[live album]] released later that year, simply titled ''[[The Tour (album)|The Tour]]''. The album spawned one single, \"Misty Blue\".\n\nOn August 17, 1999, Blige's fourth album, titled ''[[Mary (Mary J. Blige album)|Mary]]'' was released. It marked a departure from her more familiar hip hop-oriented sound; this set featured a more earthy, whimsical, and [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]-tinged collection of songs, reminiscent of the 1970s to early 1980s soul. She also appeared on ''[[In Concert: A Benefit for the Crossroads Centre at Antigua]]'' with [[Eric Clapton]] in 1999. On December 14, 1999, the album was re-released as a double-disc set. The second disc was enhanced with the music videos for the singles \"All That I Can Say\" and \"Deep Inside\" and included two bonus tracks: \"Sincerity\" (featuring [[Nas]], Andy Hogan and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]) and \"Confrontation\" (a collaboration with hip hop duo [[Funkmaster Flex]] & [[Big Kap]] originally from their 1999 album ''The Tunnel''). The ''Mary'' album was critically praised, becoming her most nominated release to date, and was certified double platinum. It was not as commercially successful as Blige's prior releases, though all of the singles: \"All That I Can Say\", \"Deep Inside\", \"Your Child\", and \"Give Me You\" performed considerably on the radio. In the meantime, MCA used the album to expand Blige's demographic into the nightclub market, as club-friendly [[dance music|dance]] [[remix]]es of the ''Mary'' singles were released. The club remix of \"Your Child\" peaked at number-one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart in October 2000. In 2001, a Japan-only compilation, ''[[Ballads (Mary J. Blige album)|Ballads]]'', was released. The album featured covers of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"Overjoyed\", and previous recordings of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s \"[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]\" and [[Dorothy Moore]]'s \"[[Misty Blue]]\". In 1999, [[George Michael]] and Mary J. Blige covered the song 'As' written by Stevie Wonder, and worldwide outside of the United States, it was the second single from George Michael's greatest hits album ''[[Ladies & Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael]]''. It became a top ten UK pop hit, reaching number four on the chart. It was not released on the U.S. version of the greatest hits collection or as a single in the U.S. Michael cited Blige's record company president for pulling the track in America after Michael's arrest for committing a lewd act.\n\nIn January 2001, Blige performed as a special guest in the [[Super Bowl XXXV halftime show]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The most memorable Super Bowl halftime shows |url=https://ew.com/gallery/super-bowl-memorable-halftime-shows/?slide=421911#421911 |website=EW.com |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=1 December 2020 |language=en |date=2 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n===2001\u20132004: ''No More Drama'' and ''Love & Life''===\n[[File:Mary j-02-mika.jpg|thumb|Blige in [[Hamburg]], Germany, 2000|alt=]]\n\nOn August 28, 2001, MCA released Blige's fifth studio album, ''[[No More Drama]]''. The album's first single, \"[[Family Affair (Mary J. Blige song)|Family Affair]]\" (produced by [[Dr. Dre]]) became her first and only number-one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, where it remained for six consecutive weeks. It was followed by two further hit singles, the European only single \"[[Dance for Me (Mary J. Blige song)|Dance for Me]]\" featuring [[Common (rapper)|Common]] with samples from \"[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]]\" by [[The Police]], and the [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]-produced [[No More Drama (song)|title track]] (originally recorded for the ''Mary'' album), which sampled \"[[Nadia's Theme]]\", the piano-driven theme song to the daytime drama ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''. Though the album sold nearly two million copies in the U.S., MCA was underwhelmed by its sales, and subsequently repackaged and re-released the album on January 29, 2002. The ''No More Drama'' re-release featured a new album cover, deleted three of the songs from the original tracklisting, while adding two brand-new songs\u2014one of which was the fourth single and top twenty Hot 100 hit \"[[Rainy Dayz]]\", (featuring [[Ja Rule]]), plus two remixes; one of the title track, serviced by Sean Combs/Puff Daddy and the single version of \"Dance for Me\" featuring Common. Blige won a Grammy for '[[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]' for the song \"He Think I Don't Know\". In April 2002, Blige performed with [[Shakira]] with the song \"[[Love Is a Battlefield]]\" on [[VH1 Divas]] show live in Las Vegas, she also performed \"[[No More Drama (song)|No More Drama]]\" and \"[[Rainy Dayz]]\" as a duet with the returning [[Whitney Houston]].\n\nOn July 22, 2002, MCA released ''[[Dance for Me (album)|Dance for Me]]'', a collection of club remixes of some of her past top hits including the [[Junior Vasquez]] remix of \"Your Child\", and the [[Thunderpuss]] mix of \"No More Drama\". This album was released in a limited edition double pack 12\" vinyl for DJ-friendly play in nightclubs.\n\nOn August 26, 2003, Blige's sixth album ''[[Love & Life (Mary J. Blige album)|Love & Life]]'' was released on [[Geffen Records]] (which had absorbed MCA Records.) Blige heavily collaborated with her one-time producer Sean Combs for this set. Due to the history between them on ''What's the 411?'' and ''My Life'', which is generally regarded as their best work, and Blige having just come off of a successful fifth album, expectations were high for the reunion effort.\n\nDespite the album debuting at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 and becoming Blige's fourth consecutive UK top ten album, ''Love & Life''{{'}}s lead-off single, the Diddy-produced \"[[Love @ 1st Sight]]\", which featured Method Man, barely cracked the top ten on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, while altogether missing the top twenty on the Hot 100 (although peaking inside the UK top twenty). The following singles, \"[[Ooh!]]\", \"[[Not Today (Mary J. Blige song)|Not Today]]\" featuring [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], \"[[Whenever I Say Your Name]]\" featuring [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] on the international re-release, and \"[[It's a Wrap]]\" fared worse. Although the album was certified platinum, it became Blige's lowest-selling at the time. Critics and fans alike largely panned the disc, citing a lack of consistency and noticeable ploys to recapture the early Blige/Combs glory. Blige and Combs reportedly struggled and clashed during the making of this album, and again parted ways upon the completion of it.<!--give source of this info per MoS-->\n\nThe album became Blige's first album in six years to debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling 285,298 copies in first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht859 |title=Previous Album Sales Chart |publisher=HITS Daily Double |access-date=February 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906112248/http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht859 |archive-date=September 6, 2013 }}</ref> ''Love & Life'' received mixed reviews from music critics.<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/bligemaryj/loveandlife?q=Mary%20J.%20Blige |title=Mary J.

I doubt myself every single day, no matter what happens\u2026 And I think I always will, and I think it's always something I'm going to struggle with. But this song helped me, and helps me moment to moment. I don't think we can ever hope to fully get over the things that make us insecure, or the voices in your head that say, 'You can't do it, you're not good enough, nobody likes you, you're not cool, you're so annoying.' But I wanted to sing this song for you because this was the first city I heard this song. And it is absolutely foolish to try and sing a Mary J. Blige song, because she's the greatest singer who ever lived. But this song matters to me, and it means so much to me to get to sing it to you, and I think it can help you if you struggle with the same kinds of insecurities that I do.}}</ref> [[Monica (singer)|Monica]],<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/cDcwt_ZYuKk Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20201019070906/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDcwt_ZYuKk Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{Citation|title=Monica on Mary J Blige interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDcwt_ZYuKk|access-date=March 5, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Layton Greene]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allhiphop.com/features/layton-greene-on-signing-to-quality-control-kodak-black-sliding-into-her-dm-s-DGanuMOIQU6AhKLAN5Je4w|title=Layton Greene On Signing To Quality Control & Kodak Black Sliding Into Her DM's|website=AllHipHop.com|language=en|access-date=March 5, 2021}}</ref> [[Keyshia Cole]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Keyshia Cole Talks Biggest Musical Inspirations |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_iKKkqlK3s |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/K_iKKkqlK3s| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|work=[[Music Choice]] |access-date=March 5, 2021|date=February 28, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Bryson Tiller]],<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/iwmvFM7Qy3E Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20190902012747/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwmvFM7Qy3E&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwmvFM7Qy3E&t=3s|title=Bryson Tiller names his TOP 10 inspirations, Rihanna vs. Beyonc\u00e9 &#124; Interview MalcolmMusic |work= MalcolmMusic|publisher=YouTube|last=Ohanwe|first=Malcolm|date=June 21, 2017|access-date=March 5, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/cheryl-cole-my-music-isnt-lifechanging-16214184.html|title=Cheryl Cole: My music isn't life-changing|date=21 September 2012|work=The Belfast Telegraph|access-date=March 5, 2021}}</ref> [[Teyana Taylor]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Wete|first=Brad|title=Interview: Teyana Taylor Talks Joining G.O.O.D.
