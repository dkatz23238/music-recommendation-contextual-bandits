See WP:ENGVAR. --> an Irish [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Dublin]], formed in 1976.<!-- Please do not remove without discussing on the talk page first --> The group consists of [[Bono]] (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), [[the Edge]] (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), [[Adam Clayton]] (bass guitar), and [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in [[post-punk]], U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, [[Effects unit|effects]]-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career.\n\nThe band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with [[Island Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'' (1980). Subsequent work such as their first UK number-one album, ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]'' (1983), and the singles \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\" and \"[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. By the mid-1980s, they had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. The group's fifth album, ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' (1987), made them international superstars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced their only number-one singles in the US to date: \"[[With or Without You]]\" and \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\".\n\nFacing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary/double album, ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' (1991), and the multimedia-intensive [[Zoo TV Tour]], the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by [[alternative rock]], [[electronic dance music]], and [[industrial music]], and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, ''[[Pop (U2 album)|Pop]]'' (1997), and the [[PopMart Tour]], which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]'' (2000) and ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'' (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their [[U2 360\u00b0 Tour]] of 2009\u20132011 set records for the highest-attended and [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tour]], both of which were surpassed in 2019. The group most recently released the companion albums ''[[Songs of Innocence (U2 album)|Songs of Innocence]]'' (2014) and ''[[Songs of Experience (U2 album)|Songs of Experience]]'' (2017), the former of which received criticism for its pervasive, no-cost release through the [[iTunes Store]].\n\nU2 have released 14 studio albums and are one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]], having sold an estimated 150\u2013170 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"170sales\">{{bulleted list|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u2-what-theyre-still-looking-for/3/|title=U2: What they're still looking for|website=[[CBS News]]|first=Anthony|last=Mason|date=24 May 2015|access-date=25 May 2015|archive-date=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525121713/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u2-what-theyre-still-looking-for/3/|url-status=dead}}|{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/former-u2-manager-paul-mcguinness-cracking-crime-on-the-c%C3%B4te-d-azur-1.2237369|title=Former U2 manager Paul McGuinness: Cracking crime on the C\u00f4te d'Azur|last=Marlowe|first=Lara|date=7 June 2015|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|access-date=8 October 2015}}}}</ref> They have won 22 [[Grammy Award]]s, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in their first year of eligibility.
