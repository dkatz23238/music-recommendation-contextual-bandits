Among the album's shortcomings, critics made note of a lack of sonic unity and the absence of the Byrds' signature jangly guitar sound.<ref name=\"hjort27\"/>  Nonetheless, the album managed to climb to number 20 on the ''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tapes chart and number 31 in the UK.<ref name=\"hjort27\"/>  In the United States, the album became the band's highest charting LP of new material since

pair of [[Neil Young]] songs.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher10\"/>  The album also featured the Gene Clark compositions \"Changing Heart\" and \"[[Full Circle Song|Full Circle]]\", the latter of which had

music press resulted in the band losing faith in the idea of an ongoing series of reunions.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher10\"/>  In the years following its release, all five band members were openly critical of the album, with the general consensus being that the material included on it was weak and that the recording sessions had been rushed and ill-thought out.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher10\"/>  In addition, McGuinn and Hillman have both suggested that with the exception of Gene Clark, the songwriting members of the band were reluctant to bring their strongest compositions to the recording sessions,
