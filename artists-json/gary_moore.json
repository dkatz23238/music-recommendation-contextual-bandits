Over the course of his career he played in various groups and performed a range of music including [[blues]], [[blues rock]], [[hard rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[jazz fusion]].\n\nInfluenced by [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] and [[Eric Clapton]], Moore began his career in the late 1960s when he joined [[Skid Row (Irish band)|Skid Row]], with whom he released two albums. After Moore left the group he joined [[Thin Lizzy]], featuring his former Skid Row bandmate and frequent collaborator [[Phil Lynott]]. Moore began his solo career in the 1970s and achieved major success with 1978's \"[[Parisienne Walkways]]\", which is considered his [[signature song]]. During the 1980s, Moore transitioned into playing hard rock and heavy metal with varying degrees of international success. In 1990, he returned to his roots with ''[[Still Got the Blues]]'', which became the most successful album of his career. Moore continued to release new music throughout his later career, collaborating with other artists from time to time. Moore died on 6 February 2011 from a heart attack while on holiday in Spain.\n\nMoore was often described as a [[virtuoso]] and has been cited as an influence by many other guitar players. He was voted as one of the greatest guitarists of all time on respective lists by ''[[Total Guitar]]'' and ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Louder]]''. Irish singer-songwriter [[Bob Geldof]] said that \"without question, [Moore] was one of the great Irish bluesmen\".<ref name=\"BBC 12382274\">{{cite news|date=7 February 2011|title=Gary Moore: an obituary|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12382274|access-date=9 September 2020}}</ref> For most of his career, Moore was heavily associated with Peter Green's famed [[Greeny (guitar)|1959 Gibson Les Paul]] guitar.
