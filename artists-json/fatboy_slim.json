In the 1980s, Cook was the bassist for the [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]-based [[indie rock]] band [[the Housemartins]], who achieved a UK number-one single with their [[a cappella]] cover of \"[[Caravan of Love]]\". After the Housemartins split up, Cook formed the electronic band [[Beats International]] in [[Brighton]], who produced the number-one single \"[[Dub Be Good to Me]]\".

When he was 14, his brother brought home the first album from the punk band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], which turned him onto that genre; he started attending gigs at the Greyhound pub in [[Croydon]] and playing in punk bands.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.acast.com/distractionpieces/normancookakafatboyslim-distractionpiecespodcastwithscroobiuspip-268|title=Norman Cook aka Fatboy Slim \u2022 Distraction Pieces Podcast with Scroobius Pip #268 {{!}} Distraction Pieces Podcast with Scroobius Pip on acast|last=acast|date=14 May 2019|website=acast|language=en|access-date=17 May 2019}}{{dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He played drums in Disque Attack, a British [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced rock band. When frontman Charlie Alcock was told by his parents that he had to give up the band to concentrate on his [[O levels]], Cook took over as lead vocalist. At The Railway Tavern in Reigate, Cook met [[Paul Heaton]], with whom he formed the Stomping Pondfrogs.\n\nAt 18, Cook went to [[University of Brighton|Brighton Polytechnic]] to read a B.A. in English, politics, and sociology, where he achieved a 2:1 in British Studies. He had begun DJing some years before, but it was at this time that he began to develop his skills in the thriving [[Brighton]] club scene, regularly appearing at the Brighton Belle and  student favourite The Basement, where (then known as DJ Quentox) he began laying the base for Brighton's hip-hop scene.\n\n=== 1985\u20131995: The Housemartins to The Mighty Dub Katz ===\nIn 1985, Heaton formed a guitar band called [[the Housemartins]]. Their bassist left on the eve of their first national tour, so Cook agreed to move to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] to join them. The band soon had a hit single, \"[[Happy Hour (The Housemartins song)|Happy Hour]]\", and their two albums, ''[[London 0 Hull 4]]'' and ''[[The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death]]'', peaked in the Top 10 of the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"martins\">{{cite web|title=HOUSEMARTINS|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/housemartins/|publisher=Official Charts Company|access-date=25 December 2013}}</ref> They also reached [[List of number-one singles from the 1980s (UK)|number one]] just before Christmas 1986 with a version of \"[[Caravan of Love]]\", originally a hit the year before for [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]].<ref name=\"martins\" /> By 1988 they split up. Heaton and the band's drummer Dave Hemingway went on to form [[The Beautiful South]], while Cook moved back to Brighton to pursue his interest in the style of music he preferred. He started working with young studio engineer Simon Thornton, with whom he continues to make records. All of Cook's records since have involved both of them to varying degrees (Thornton is credited in 2004 as \"Executive Producer\", for example).\n\nCook achieved his first solo hit in 1989, \"Blame It on the Bassline\", featuring future [[Beats International]] member MC Wildski. Credited to \"Norman Cook feat. MC Wildski\", the song followed the basic template of what would become Beats International's style. It was a modest hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching number 29.\n\nCook formed Beats International, a loose confederation of [[studio musician]]s including vocalists [[Lindy Layton]] and Lester Noel, rappers D.J. Baptiste and MC Wildski, and keyboardist Andy Boucher. Their first album, ''[[Let Them Eat Bingo]]'', included the number one single \"[[Dub Be Good to Me]]\", which caused a legal dispute over allegations of [[copyright]] infringement through the liberal use of unauthorised [[Sampling (music)|samples]]: the [[bassline]] was lifted note for note from [[The Clash]]'s \"[[The Guns of Brixton]]\" and the lyrics borrowed heavily from [[The S.O.S. Band]]'s \"[[Just Be Good to Me]]\". Cook lost the case and was ordered to pay back twice the royalties made on the record, bankrupting him. The 1991 follow-up album ''Excursion on the Version'', an exploration of [[Dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] music, failed to duplicate its predecessor's success as it did not chart.\n\nCook then formed [[Freak Power]] with horn player [[Ashley Slater]] and singer Jesse Graham. They released their debut album ''[[Drive-Thru Booty]]'' in 1994, which contained the single \"[[Turn On, Tune In, Cop Out]]\". [[Levi's]] used the song in a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign. In 1996, Cook rejoined Freak Power for their second album, ''More of Everything for Everybody''.\n\nCook enlisted help from producer friends Tim Jeffery and JC Reid to create a [[house music]] album as [[Pizzaman (band)|Pizzaman]]. The 1995 ''Pizzamania'' album spawned three [[UK Top 40]] hits: \"[[Trippin' on Sunshine]]\", \"[[Sex on the Streets]]\", and \"[[Happiness (Pizzaman song)|Happiness]]\". [[Del Monte Foods]] corporation used \"Happiness\" in a UK fruit juice ad. The videos for the three singles were directed by [[Michael Dominic]].\n\nCook also formed the group The Mighty Dub Katz with Gareth Hansome (aka GMoney), his former flatmate. Together they started the ''Boutique'' Nightclub in Brighton, formerly known as the ''Big Beat Boutique''. Their biggest song together was \"[[Magic Carpet Ride (Mighty Dub Katz song)|Magic Carpet Ride]]\".\n\n=== 1996\u20132008: Fatboy Slim ===\n[[File:Fatboy Slim at Portrush Beach Party 2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cook performing at the first \"Beach Party\" in [[Portrush]], 2006]]\nCook adopted a quasi-blues-style pseudonym Fatboy Slim in 1996. Cook said of the name: \"It doesn't mean anything. I've told so many different lies over the years about it I can't actually remember the truth.

Fatboy Slim's next work was the single \"[[The Rockafeller Skank]]\", released before the album ''[[You've Come a Long Way, Baby]]'', both of which were released in 1998. \"[[Praise You]]\", also from this album, was Cook's first UK solo [[List of Number 1 singles from the 1990s (UK)#1999|number one]].

It consists of 18 tracks, including ten Top 40 singles, a couple of Number Ones, and two new tracks, \"[[Champion Sound (song)|Champion Sound]]\" and \"[[That Old Pair of Jeans]]\".\n\nIn 2006, Cook travelled to [[Cuba]] and wrote and produced two original Cuban crossover tracks for the album ''The Revolution Presents: Revolution'', which was released by [[Studio ! K7]] and Rapster Records in 2009. The tracks are \"Shelter\" (which featured longtime collaborator [[Lateef the Truthspeaker|Lateef]]) and \"Siente Mi Ritmo\", featuring Cuba's female vocal group Sexto Sentido. The recordings took place at Cuba's EGREM Studios, home of the [[Buena Vista Social Club]], and featured a band of young Cuban musicians, including [[Harold Lopez Nussa]]. Another track recorded during these sessions, \"Guaguanco\", was released separately under the Mighty Dub Katz moniker in 2006.\n\n=== 2008\u20132012: The Brighton Port Authority ===\nThe Brighton Port Authority debuted in 2008 with a collaboration with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]] titled \"[[Toe Jam (The Brighton Port Authority song)|Toe Jam]]\", along with a video featuring nude dancers with [[censor bar]]s on them, making pictures and words with them.\n\nThe soundtrack album for the TV series ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' also includes the Brighton Port Authority's track \"He's Frank (Slight Return)\" (a cover of a song by [[The Monochrome Set]]), with [[Iggy Pop]] as vocalist.
