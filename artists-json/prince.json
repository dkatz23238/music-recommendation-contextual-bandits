''Prince'' is also a title of [[nobility]] (often highest), often [[hereditary title|hereditary]], in some [[Europe]]an [[State (polity)|states]]. The female equivalent is a [[princess]]. The [[English language|English word]] derives, via the [[French language|French word]] ''prince'', from the [[Latin]] noun {{Lang|la|[[princeps|pr\u012bnceps]]}}, from {{Lang|la|primus}} (first) and {{Lang|la|caput}} (head), meaning \"the first, foremost, the chief, most distinguished, noble [[monarch|ruler]], prince\".<ref>Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant & Charles, 260th thousand</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Cicer\u00f3n denuncia a Catilina, por Cesare Maccari.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Cicero]] attacks [[Catiline]] in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] of the [[Roman Republic]].]]\nThe [[Latin]] word {{Lang|la|pr\u012bnceps}} (older Latin *pr\u012bsmo-kaps, literally \"the one who takes the first [place/position]\"), became the usual title of the informal leader of the [[Roman senate]] some centuries before the transition to [[Roman Empire|empire]], the ''[[princeps senatus]]''.\n\n[[Emperor Augustus]] established the formal position of monarch on the basis of [[principate]], not [[Dominate|dominion]]. He also tasked his grandsons as summer rulers of the city when most of the government were on holiday in the country or attending religious rituals, and, for that task, granted them the title of princeps.\n\nThe title has generic and substantive meanings:\n* Generically, ''prince'' refers to a member of a family that [[monarchy|ruled by hereditary right]] (such as the [[House of Sverre]] in [[Norway]]) or to non-reigning descendants, the title referring to sovereigns, former sovereigns' [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s as descendants of King [[Haakon V]]) or to [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] of a sovereign's family. The term may be broadly used of persons in various cultures, continents or eras. In Europe, it is the title legally borne by [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynastic]] [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] in monarchies, and borne by courtesy by members of formerly reigning dynasties.\n* As a [[substantive title]], a ''prince'' was a monarch of the lowest [[Nobility|rank]] in post-[[Napol\u00e9on I of France|Napoleon]]ic Europe, e.g. Princes of [[Andorra]], [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], [[Mingrelia]], [[Monaco]], [[Waldeck and Pyrmont]], [[Wallachia]], etc.\n* Also substantively, the title was granted by [[pope]]s and secular monarchs to specific individuals and to the [[agnatic primogeniture|heads]] of some high-ranking European families who, however, never exercised dynastic sovereignty and whose cadets are not entitled to share the princely title, ''viz'' the Princes de Beauvau-Craon, von [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Colonna]], von [[Dohna-Schlobitten]], von Eulenburg, de Faucigny-Lucinge, von [[Lichnowsky]], von [[Pszczyna|Pless]], Ruffo di Calabria, (de [[Talleyrand]]) von [[\u017baga\u0144|Sagan]], van [[Duke of Ursel|Ursel]], etc.\n* Generically, cadets of some non-sovereign families whose head bears the non-dynastic title of prince (or, less commonly, [[duke]]) were sometimes also authorized to use the princely title, e.g. von Carolath-Beuthen, de [[House of Broglie|Broglie]], Demidoff di San Donato, [[Lieven]], de [[House of Merode|Merode]], [[House of Pignatelli|Pignatelli]], [[Radziwill]], von [[Wrede]], [[Prince Felix Yusupov|Yussopov]], etc.\n* Substantively, the [[heir apparent|heirs apparent]] in some monarchies use a specific princely title associated with a territory within the monarch's [[realm]], e.g. the Princes of Asturias (Spain), Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 (Brazil, formerly), Orange (Netherlands), Viana (Navarre, formerly), Wales (U.K.), etc.\n* Substantively, it became the fashion from the 17th century for the [[heir apparent|heirs apparent]] of the leading [[duke|ducal]] families to assume a princely title, associated with a ''[[fief|seigneurie]]'' in the family's possession. These titles were borne by courtesy and preserved by tradition, not law, e.g. the ''princes de'', respectively, Bidache (Gramont), Marcillac (La Rochefoucauld), Tonnay-Charente (Mortemart), Poix (Noailles), L\u00e9on (Rohan-Chabot), etc.\n\n==Prince as generic for ruler==\nThe original but now less common use of the word was the application of the Latin word ''{{Lang|la|[[Princeps|pr\u012bnceps]]}}'', from [[Byzantine Empire|late Roman]] [[law]] and the classical system of government that eventually gave way to the European [[feudalism|feudal]] society. In this sense, a prince is a ruler of a territory that is [[sovereignty|sovereign]] or quasi-sovereign, i.e., exercising substantial (though not all) prerogatives associated with monarchs of independent nations, such as the [[imperial immediacy|immediate states]] within the historical boundaries of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In [[medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]], there were as many as two hundred such territories, especially in Italy, Germany, and [[Gaelic Ireland]]. In this sense, \"prince\" is used of any and all rulers, regardless of actual title or precise rank. This is the [[Renaissance]] use of the term found in [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s famous work, ''[[The Prince|Il Principe]]''.<ref name=\"furst\">\"F\u00fcrst - Origins and cognates of the title\", 2006, webpage: [http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Frst__Other_uses_in_German/id/5035795 EFest-Frst] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828052838/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Frst__Other_uses_in_German/id/5035795 |date=2011-08-28 }}.</ref> It is also used in this sense in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].\n\nAs a title, by the end of the medieval era, ''prince'' was borne by rulers of territories that were either substantially smaller than those of or exercised fewer of the rights of sovereignty than did emperors and kings. A [[lord]] of even a quite small territory might come to be referred to as a ''prince'' before the 13th century, either from translations of a native title into the Latin ''{{Lang|la|pr\u012bnceps}}'' (as for the hereditary ruler of [[Wales]]) or when the lord's territory was [[allodial title|allodial]]. The lord of an [[allodial title|allodium]] owned his lands and exercised prerogatives over the subjects in his territory absolutely, owing no feudal homage or duty as a vassal to a [[feudalism|liege lord]], nor being subject to any higher jurisdiction. Most small territories designated as principalities during feudal eras were allodial, e.g. the [[Dombes|Princedom of Dombes]].\n\nLords who exercised lawful authority over territories and people within a feudal hierarchy were also sometimes regarded as ''princes'' in the general sense, especially if they held the rank of [[count]] or higher. This is attested in some surviving [[style (manner of address)|styles]] for e.g., British earls, [[marquess]]es, and [[duke]]s are still addressed by the [[The Crown|Crown]] on [[ceremony|ceremonial]] occasions as ''high and noble princes'' (cf. [[Royal and noble styles]]).\n\nIn parts of the Holy Roman Empire in which [[primogeniture]] did not prevail (e.g., Germany), all legitimate [[patrilineality|agnates]] had an equal right to the family's hereditary titles. While offices such as [[emperor]], [[king]], and [[prince elector|elector]] could only be legally occupied by one dynast at a time, holders of such other titles as [[duke]], [[margrave]], [[landgrave]], [[count palatine]], and prince could only differentiate themselves by adding the name of their [[appanage]] to the family's original title. This tended to proliferate unwieldy titles (e.g. [[Catherine II of Russia|Princess Katherine of Anhalt-Zerbst]]; [[Charles X of Sweden|Karl, Count Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken-Neukastell-Kleeburg]]; or [[Prince Christian Charles of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl\u00f6n-Norburg]]) and, as [[agnatic primogeniture]] gradually became the norm in the Holy Roman Empire by the end of the 18th century, another means of distinguishing the monarch from other members of his dynasty became necessary. Gradual substitution of the title of ''Prinz'' for the monarch's title of ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' occurred, and became customary for cadets in all German dynasties except in the grand duchies of [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]].<ref>''Almanach de Gotha'' (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), pages 14\u2013131.</ref> Both {{Lang|de|Prinz}} and ''{{Lang|de|F\u00fcrst}}'' are translated into English as \"prince\", but they reflect not only different but mutually exclusive concepts.\n\nThis distinction had evolved before the 18th century (although Liechtenstein long remained an exception, with cadets and females using {{Lang|de|F\u00fcrst/F\u00fcrstin}} into the 19th century) for dynasties headed by a ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' in Germany. The custom spread through the [[Continental Europe|Continent]] to such an extent that a renowned imperial general who belonged to a [[cadet branch]] of a reigning ducal family, remains best known to history by the generic dynastic title, \"[[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]\". Note that the princely title was used as a prefix to his Christian name, which also became customary.\n\nCadets of France's other {{Lang|fr|[[princes \u00e9trangers]]}} affected similar usage under the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] kings. Always facing the scepticism of Saint-Simon and like-minded courtiers, these quasi-royal aristocrats' assumption of the princely title as a personal, rather than territorial, designation encountered some resistance. In writing ''Histoire Genealogique et Chonologique'', [[P\u00e8re Anselme]] accepts that, by the end of the 17th century, the heir apparent to the [[House of la Tour d'Auvergne|House of La Tour d'Auvergne]]'s sovereign duchy bears the title ''Prince de Bouillon'', but he would record in 1728 that the heir's ''La Tour'' cousin, the Count of Oliergues, is \"''known as'' the Prince Frederick\" (\"''dit'' le prince Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\").<ref>{{cite book|author = P\u00e8re Anselme|author-link= P\u00e8re Anselme|title= Histoire Genealogique et Chronologique de la Maison Royale de France|year = 1728|publisher= Compagnie des Libraires|location= Paris|language= fr|pages= 543, 545|chapter= Ducs de Bouillon}}</ref>\n\nThe post-medieval rank of {{Lang|de|gef\u00fcrsteter Graf}} (princely count) embraced but elevated the German equivalent of the intermediate French, English and Spanish nobles. In the Holy Roman Empire, these nobles rose to dynastic status by preserving from the Imperial crown ({{Lang|la|[[de jure]]}} after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648) the exercise of such sovereign prerogatives as the [[mint (coin)|minting]] of money; the [[muster (military)|muster]] of military troops and the right to wage war and contract [[treaty|treaties]]; local judicial authority and [[constabulary]] enforcement; and the habit of inter-marrying with sovereign dynasties. By the 19th century, cadets of a ''{{Lang|de|[[F\u00fcrst]]}}'' would become known as ''{{Lang|de|Prinzen}}''.\n\n==Princes consort and princes of the blood==\n{{confusing|section|date=June 2012}}\n\n{{Main article|Prince du Sang}}\n[[File:Grandconde.jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9]], was the {{lang|fr|premier prince du sang}} during his lifetime (painted by Joost van Egmont).]]\n\nThe husband of a [[queen regnant]] is usually titled \"[[prince consort]]\" or simply \"prince\", whereas the wives of male monarchs take the female equivalent (e.g., empress, queen) of their husband's title. In Brazil, Portugal and Spain, however, the husband of a female monarch is accorded the masculine equivalent of her title (e.g., emperor, king), at least after he fathered her heir. In previous epochs, husbands of queens regnant were often deemed entitled to the [[crown matrimonial]], sharing their consorts' regnal title and rank {{Lang|la|[[jure uxoris]]}}.\n\nHowever, in cultures which allow the ruler to have several wives (e.g., four in [[Islam]]) or official [[concubine]]s (e.g., [[Imperial China]], [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Thailand]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]]), these women, sometimes collectively referred to as a [[harem]], often have specific rules determining their relative hierarchy and a variety of titles, which may distinguish between those whose offspring can be in line for the succession or not, or specifically who is mother to the heir to the throne.\n\nTo complicate matters, the style ''His/Her (Imperial/Royal) Highness'', a [[prefix]] often accompanying the title of a dynastic prince, may be awarded/withheld separately (as a compromise or consolation prize, in some sense, e.g., [[Duke of C\u00e1diz#List of holders|Duke of C\u00e1diz]], [[Duke of Windsor|Duchess of Windsor]], [[Lilian, Princess of R\u00e9thy#Titles|Princesse de R\u00e9thy]], [[Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza|Prince d'Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]]).\n\nAlthough the arrangement set out above is the one that is most commonly understood, there are also different systems. Depending on country, epoch, and translation, other usages of \"prince\" are possible.\n\nForeign-language titles such as {{Lang-it|principe}}, {{Lang-fr|prince}}, {{Lang-de|[[F\u00fcrst]]}}, {{Lang-de|Prinz|links=no}} (non-reigning descendant of a reigning monarch),<ref name=\"DDNP1\">[[Duden]]; Definition of the German title ''F\u00fcrst'' (in German).

Other examples are {{lang|fa-Latn|(e)[[mirza]](da), [[khanzada (title)|khanzada]], [[nawabzada]], [[sahibzada]], [[shahzada (title)|shahzada]], [[sultanzada]]}} (all using the [[Persian language|Persian]] patronymic suffix ''-zada'', meaning \"son, descendant\"). However, some princely titles develop in unusual ways, such as adoption of a style for dynasts which is not pegged to the ruler's title, but rather continues an old tradition (e.g., \"[[grand duke]]\" in [[Romanov]] Russia or \"[[archduke]]\" in Habsburg Austria), claims dynastic succession to a lost monarchy (e.g. {{lang|fr|Prince de Tarente}} for the [[La Tr\u00e9moille|La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle heirs]] to the [[kingdom of Sicily|Neapolitan throne]]), or descends from a ruler whose princely title or sovereign status was not de jure hereditary, but attributed to descendants as an international courtesy, (e.g., [[Gr\u00e9goire Bibesco-Bassaraba|Bibesco-Bassaraba de Brancovan]], [[Poniatowski]], [[Ypsilantis|Ypsilanti]]).\n\n===Specific titles===\n[[File:D. Jos\u00e9, Pr\u00edncipe da Beira e do Brasil.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Jos\u00e9, Prince of Brazil]], [[Duke of Braganza]], died before he could ascend to the throne of Portugal.]]\nIn some dynasties, a specific style other than prince has become customary for dynasts, such as {{Lang|fr|[[fils de France]]}} in the [[House of Capet]], and {{Lang|es|[[Infante]]}}. {{Lang|es|Infante}} was borne by children of the monarch other than the [[heir apparent]] in all of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] monarchies. Some monarchies used a specific princely title for their heirs, such as [[Prince of Asturias]] in Spain and [[Prince of Brazil]] in Portugal.\n\nSometimes a specific title is commonly used by various dynasties in a region, e.g. [[Mian (title)|Mian]] in various of the Punjabi princely [[Hill States]] (lower Himalayan region in British India).\n\nEuropean dynasties usually awarded [[appanage]]s to princes of the blood, typically attached to a feudal noble title, such as [[Prince of Orange]] in the Netherlands, Britain's [[royal duke]]s, the {{Lang|fr|[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]}} in France, the Count of Flanders in Belgium, and the Count of Syracuse in [[Two Sicilies|Sicily]]. Sometimes appanage titles were princely, e.g. [[Prince of Achaia]] (Courtenay), {{Lang|fr|Prince de Cond\u00e9}} (Bourbon), [[Prince of Carignan]] (Savoy), but it was the fact that their owners were of princely ''rank'' rather than that they held a princely ''title'' which was the source of their pre-eminence.\n\nFor the often specific terminology concerning an heir apparent, see [[Crown prince]].\n\n==Prince as a substantive title==\n\nOther princes derive their title not from dynastic membership as such, but from inheritance of a title named for a specific and historical territory. The family's possession of prerogatives or properties in that territory might be long past. Such were most of the \"princedoms\" of France's ''[[ancien r\u00e9gime]]'', so resented for their pretentiousness in the memoirs of [[Louis de Rouvroy, Duke of Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. These included the princedoms of Arches-Charleville, Boisbelle-Henrichemont, Chalais, Ch\u00e2teau-Regnault, Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9e, Martigues, Merc\u0153ur, Sedan, Talmond, Tingrey, and the \"kingship\" of Yvetot,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/frprince.htm#list|title=The Rank/Title of Prince in France|first=Francois|last=Velde|access-date=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324220136/http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/frprince.htm#list|archive-date=24 March 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> among others.\n\n===Prince as a reigning monarch===<!-- \"reigning prince\" redirects here, edit that redirect if editing this heading-->\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nA prince or princess who is the [[head of state]] of a territory that has a [[monarchy]] as a [[form of government]] is a reigning prince.\n\n====Extant principalities====\nThe current princely monarchies include:\n* The [[co-principality]] of [[Principality of Andorra|Andorra]] (current reigning princes are the [[President of the French Republic|French President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] and [[Joan Enric Vives Sic\u00edlia|HE Joan Enric Vives Sic\u00edlia]])\n* The [[emir]]ate of [[Kuwait]] (current reigning emir is [[Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]])\n* The [[principality]] of [[Liechtenstein]] (current reigning prince is [[Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Hans-Adam II]])\n* The principality of [[Monaco]] (current reigning prince is [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Albert II]])\n* The [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (currently vacant following the death of [[Giacomo dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto]], [[Marco Luzzago]] is Lieutenant of the Grand Master and acting head of the order.

Princely titles self-assumed by the {{Lang|fr|[[prince du sang|princes du sang]]}} and by the {{Lang|fr|[[prince \u00e9tranger|princes \u00e9trangers]]}} were generally tolerated by the king and used at the royal court, outside the [[Parlement of Paris]].

Different (historical, religious...) backgrounds have also begot significantly different dynastic and nobiliary systems, which are poorly represented by the 'closest' western analogy.\n\nIt therefore makes sense to treat these per civilization.\n\n===Islamic traditions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n*Arabian tradition since the [[caliphate]]\u2014in several monarchies it remains customary to use the title [[Sheikh]] (in itself below princely rank) for all members of the royal family. In families (often reigning dynasties) which claim descent from [[Muhammad]], this is expressed in either of a number of titles (supposing different exact relations): sayid, sharif; these are retained even when too remote from any line of succession to be a member of any dynasty. \n*In Saudi Arabia the title of [[Emir]] is used in role of prince for all members of the [[House of Saud]].\n*In Iraq, the direct descendants of previous Emirs from the largest tribes, who ruled the kingdoms before modern statehood, use the title of Sheikh or Prince as the progeny of royalty.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Howell|first=Georgina|title=Queen of The Desert: The Extraordinary Life of Gertrude Bell|date=15 January 2015|isbn=9781447286264}}</ref>\n*In the Ottoman Empire, the sovereign of imperial rank (incorrectly known in the west as ''(Great) sultan'') was styled ''[[padishah]]'' with a host of additional titles, reflecting his claim as political successor to the various conquered states. Princes of the blood, male, were given the style [[\u015eehzade]].\n*Persia (Iran)\u2014Princes as members of a royal family, are referred to by the title ''Shahzadeh'', meaning \"descendant of the king\". Since the word ''zadeh'' could refer to either a male or female descendant, ''Shahzadeh'' had the parallel meaning of \"princess\" as well. Princes can also be sons of provincial kings ([[Khan (title)|Khan]]) and the title referring to them would be the title of Khanzadeh. Princes as people who got a title from the King are called \"[[Mirza]]\", diminutive of \"Amir Zadeh\" (King's Son).\n*In Indian Muslim dynasties, the most common titles were ''[[Mirza]]'' (from ''Amirzada'') and ''[[Shah#Shahzada|Shahzada]]''; while ''[[Nawabzada]]'' and ''[[Sahibzada]]'' were also given to younger blood princes.\n*In [[Kazakh Khanate]] the title Sultan was used for lords from a ruling dynasty (direct descendants of [[Genghis Khan]]), that gives them a right to be elected as [[khan (title)|khan]], as an experienced ruler; and an honorific ''[[tore]]'' ([[:ru:\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435 (\u0440\u043e\u0434)]]) for ordinary members of a ruling dynasty.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Non-Islamic Asian traditions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\n====China====\nBefore [[Qin dynasty]], prince (in the sense of royal family member) had no special title. Since [[Han dynasty]], royal family members were entitled ''Wang'' ({{lang|ch|\u738b}}, lit. King), the former highest title which was then replaced by ''Huang Di'' ({{lang|ch|\u7687\u5e1d}}, lit. Emperor). Since [[Western Jin]], the ''Wang'' rank was divided into two ranks, ''Qin Wang'' ({{lang|ch|\u89aa\u738b}}, lit. King of the Blood) and ''Jun Wang'' ({{lang|ch|\u90e1\u738b}}, lit. King of the Commandery). Only family of the Emperor can be entitled ''Qin Wang'', so prince is usually translated as ''Qin Wang'', e.g. \u83f2\u5229\u666e\u89aa\u738b (Prince Philip). For the son of the ruler, prince is usually translated as ''Huang Zi'' ({{lang|ch|\u7687\u5b50}}, lit. Son of the Emperor) or ''Wang Zi'' ({{lang|ch|\u738b\u5b50}} lit., Son of the King), e.g. \u67e5\u723e\u65af\u738b\u5b50 (Prince Charles).\n\nAs a title of nobility, prince can be translated as ''Qin Wang'' according to tradition, ''Da Gong'' (\u5927\u516c, lit., Grand Duke) if one want to emphasize that it is a very high rank but below the King (''Wang''), or just ''Zhu Hou'' ({{lang|ch|\u8bf8\u4faf}}, lit. princes) which refers to princes of all ranks in general. For example, \u6469\u7d0d\u54e5\u89aa\u738b (Prince of Monaco).\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, the title ''K\u014dshaku'' ({{lang|ja|\u516c\u7235}}) was used as the highest title of ''[[Kazoku]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u83ef\u65cf}} Japanese modern nobility) before the present constitution. ''K\u014dshaku'', however, is more commonly translated as \"Duke\" to avoid confusion with the following royal ranks in the Imperial Household: ''Shinn\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u89aa\u738b}} literally, Prince of the Blood); ''Naishinn\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u5185\u89aa\u738b}} lit., Princess of the Blood in her own right); and ''Shinn\u014dhi'' {{lang|ja|\u89aa\u738b\u5983}} lit., Princess Consort); or ''\u014c'' ({{lang|ja|\u738b}} lit., Prince); ''Jyo-\u014c'' ({{lang|ja|\u5973\u738b}} lit., Princess (in her own right)); and ''\u014chi'' ({{lang|ja|\u738b\u5983}} lit., Princess Consort). The former is the higher title of a male member of the Imperial family while the latter is the lower.\n\n====Korea====\nIn the [[Joseon Dynasty]], the title \"Prince\" was used for the king's male-line descendants. There were generally the divisions of princedom: the king's legitimate son used the title ''daegun'' (\ub300\uad70, \u5927\u541b, literally \"grand prince\"). A son born of a concubine as well as the great-great-grandsons of the king used the title ''gun'' (\uad70, \u541b, lit. \"prince\"). But the title of ''gun'' wasn't limited to the royal family. Instead, it was often granted as an honorary and non-hereditory title.\nAs noble titles no longer exist in modern Korea, the English word \"Prince\" is now usually translated as {{transl|ko|wangja}} (\uc655\uc790, \u738b\u5b50, lit. \"king's son\"), referring to princes from non-Korean royal families. Princes and principalities in continental Europe are almost always confused with dukes and duchies in Korean speech, both being translated as ''gong'' (\uacf5, \u516c, lit. \"duke\") and {{transl|ko|gongguk}} (\uacf5\uad6d, \u516c\u570b, lit. \"duchy\").\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nThe title 'Prince' was used for the [[Monarch|King's]] son in [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] generation in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n====India====\n[[File:Weeks Edwin Indian Prince And Parade Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Indian Prince And Parade Ceremony (by [[Edwin Lord Weeks]])]] \n''See'' [[princely states]] for the often particular, mainly [[Hindu]] titles in former [[British Raj|British India]], including modern [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]], and [[Nepal]].\n\n====Indochina====\n''See'' [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Laos]]\n\n====Philippines====\n''See'' [[Principalia]], the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]].\n\n====Thailand====\nIn [[Thailand]] (formerly Siam), the title of Prince was divided into three classes depending on the rank of their mothers. Those who were born of a king and had a royal mother (a queen or princess consort) are titled ''[[Thai royal ranks and titles#Chao Fa .28HRH Prince.29 .28HRH Princess.29|Chaofa Chai]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e22}}: literally, \"Male Celestial Lord\"). Those born of a king and a commoner, or children of Chaofas, are tilted ''[[Phra Ong Chao]]'' (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32). The children of Phra Ong Chaos are titled ''[[Mom Chao]]'' (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32), abbreviated as M.C. (or \u0e21.\u0e08.).\n\n===African traditions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nA Western model was sometimes copied by emancipated colonial regimes (e.g. Bokassa I's short-lived [[Central-African Empire]] in Napoleonic fashion). Otherwise, most of the styles for members of ruling families do not lend themselves well to English translation. Nonetheless, in general the princely style has gradually replaced the [[colony|colonialist]] title of \"[[tribal chief|chief]]\", which does not particularly connote dynastic rank to Westerners, e.g. [[House of Dlamini|Swazi Royal Family]] and [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu#Children|Zulu Royal Family]]. Nominally [[Minister (government)|ministerial]] chiefly titles, such as the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] ''[[Oba (ruler)#Oloye|Oloye]]'' and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] ''[[InDuna]]'', still exist as distinct titles in kingdoms all over Africa.\n\n==Title in religion==\n[[File:Bellarmine 3.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Bellarmine|Saint Robert Cardinal Bellarmine]] was a prince of the Roman Catholic Church during his lifetime.]]\n\nIn states with an element of [[theocracy]], this can affect princehood in several ways, such as the style of the ruler (e.g. with a secondary title meaning son or servant of a named divinity), but also the mode of succession (even reincarnation and recognition).\n\n=== Christianity ===\nCertain religious offices may be considered of princely rank, or imply comparable temporal rights. The Prince-Popes, [[Pope]], Hereditary Prince-Cardinals, [[Cardinal (Roman Catholic)|Cardinals]], Prince-Lord Bishops, [[Prince Bishop]]s, [[Lord Bishop]]s, [[Prince-Provost]], and [[Prince-abbot]]s are referred to as [[Prince of the Church|Princes of the Church]].\n\nAlso, in [[Christianity]], [[Jesus Christ]] is sometimes referred to as the ''Prince of Peace''.<ref>This is a title for [[Jesus Christ]] (among others) given in Isaiah 9:6.</ref> Other titles for Jesus Christ are ''Prince of Princes'',<ref>A title for [[Jesus Christ]] given in Daniel 8:25.</ref> ''Prince of the Covenant'',<ref>A title for [[Jesus Christ]] given in Daniel 11:22.</ref> ''Prince of Life'',<ref>A title for [[Jesus Christ]] given in Acts 3:15.</ref> and ''Prince of the Kings of the Earth''.<ref>A title for [[Jesus Christ]] given in Revelation 1:5.</ref> Further, [[Satan]] is popularly titled the ''Prince of Darkness'';<ref>{{cite book |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost |last=Milton |first=John |title=Paradise Lost |edition=1st |location=London |publisher=Samuel Simmons |year=1667 |access-date=2018-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108175536/https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost |archive-date=2018-01-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> and in the Christian faith he is also referred to as the ''Prince of this World''<ref>A title for [[Satan]] given in John 12:31.</ref><ref>A title for [[Satan]] given in John 14:30.</ref><ref>A title for [[Satan]] given in John 16:11.</ref> and the ''Prince of the Power of the Air''.<ref>A title for [[Satan]] given in Ephesians 2:2.</ref> Another title for Satan, not as common today but apparently so in approximately 30 A.D. by the [[Pharisees]] of the day, was the title ''Prince of the Devils''.<ref>A title for [[Satan]] given in Matthew 9:34.</ref><ref>A title for [[Satan]] given in Matthew 12:24.</ref><ref>A title for [[Satan]] given in Mark 3:22.</ref> ''Prince of Israel'', ''Prince of the Angels'', and ''Prince of Light'' are titles given to the Archangel [[Saint Michael|Michael]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Some Christian churches also believe that since all Christians, like Jesus Christ, are children of God,<ref>One of several passages explaining that regenerate men are both children of God and co-heirs with His son [[Jesus Christ]] is given in Roman 8:17.</ref> then they too are princes and princesses of Heaven. [[Saint Peter]], a disciple of Jesus, is also known as the [[Prince of the Apostles]].\n\n=== Islam ===\n==== Sunni Islam ====\nThe title Prince is used in [[Sunni Islam]] for the descendants of [[Hazrat Ishaan]], who are the [[Imamate|Imams]] of [[Ahl al-Bayt|Prophet Muhammad\u00b4s family]] in Ishaani Sunni belief and supreme leaders of [[Naqshbandi|the Naqshbandi Sufi community]] as blood descendants of their grandpatriarch [[Baha' al-Din Naqshband|Sayyid Bahauddin Naqshband]]. The title \"Shahzada\", \"Amir\", \"Mir\" and \"Sardar\" are all translated as Prince and are until today used to address the Hazrat Ishaans in regards to their relations to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|Pashtun]] royal family and to pay tribute to their responsibility of leading Ishaani Sunni Islam. It is until today used as a strengthened custom that survived the abolishment of the [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|Afghan monarchy]] on the occasion of [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|the Soviet Invasion in Afghanistan]].<ref>Subh E Noor, Programm 19th Jan 2019, 92NewsHD; recorded and published on YouTube</ref><ref>Tazkare Khwanadane Hazrat Eshan(genealogy of the family of Hazrat Eshan)(by author and investigator:Muhammad Yasin Qasvari Naqshbandi company:Edara Talimat Naqshbandiyya Lahore)</ref>\n\n==== Shia Islam ====\nIn [[Shia Islam]] the title Prince is also used as an address for [[Aga Khan|the Agha Khan]] the leader of the [[Nizari Isma'ilism|Nizari ismaili Shiite community]]. The title Prince is -similar as for the Hazrat Ishaan- prevailing as a custom on the occasion of its long use as members of the [[Qajar Iran|Qajar royal family]] and in regards to their responsibility of leading [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili Shiite Islam]].<ref>\"Table of Personal Salutes, 11 Gun Salutes\".
