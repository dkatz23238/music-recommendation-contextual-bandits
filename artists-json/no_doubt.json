For most of their career, the band has consisted of vocalist [[Gwen Stefani]], guitarist [[Tom Dumont]], bassist [[Tony Kanal]], and drummer [[Adrian Young]]. Since the mid-1990s, they were supported by trombonist and keyboardist [[Gabrial McNair]] and trumpeter and keyboardist Stephen Bradley in live performances.\n\nThough their [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|1992 eponymous debut album]] failed to make an impact, its [[ska punk]]\u2013inspired follow-up ''[[The Beacon Street Collection]]'' sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, over triple that of its predecessor. The band's [[RIAA certification|diamond-certified]] album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' (1995) benefited from the resurgence of [[third-wave ska]] in the 1990s, and \"[[Don't Speak]]\", the third single from the album, which set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart. \"[[Just a Girl]]\", co-written by Stefani, was described as \"the most popular cut on the CD\".<ref name=\"orangeCoast\">{{Cite news|last=Christian Goulding|first=Susan|date=June 1996|title=An Uncommon Angst: In the shadow of the Matterhorn, No Doubt composed ''Tragic Kingdom''|page=24|work=[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast Magazine]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24|issn=0279-0483}}</ref>\n\nThe group's next album, ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' (2000), despite its Top 40 hit single \"[[Simple Kind of Life]]\", did not match the success of their previous album, but received critical praise and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[2001 Grammy Awards|43rd Grammy Awards]]. Fifteen months later, the band reappeared with the album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001), which incorporated [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in [[Jamaica]] and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists [[Bounty Killer]], [[Sly and Robbie]], and [[Lady Saw]]. The album produced two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning singles, \"[[Hey Baby (No Doubt song)|Hey Baby]]\" and \"[[Underneath It All]]\". \"[[Hella Good]]\" was also nominated for a Grammy award. On November 22, 2002, No Doubt received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly, in [[Disneyland]] during the band's appearance on ([[KROQ-FM]]) where they performed five songs.<ref>{{cite web|date=November 21, 2002|title=News : No Doubt To Receive Key To The City Of Anaheim|url=http://www.nodoubt.com/blog/default.aspx?nid=3331&cmnt=1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926225928/http://www.nodoubt.com/blog/default.aspx?nid=3331&cmnt=1|archive-date=September 26, 2011|access-date=2011-07-07|website=No Doubt official website}}</ref> After a 2004 tour the band embarked on solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums ''[[Love.

In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth and latest effort, titled ''[[Push and Shove (album)|Push and Shove]]'' (2012), and released their single \"[[Settle Down (No Doubt song)|Settle Down]]\".

Stefani acquired a keyboard and gathered some players together to practice; these included himself (keyboards), his sister [[Gwen Stefani]] (backing vocals), John Spence (lead vocals), Jerry McMahon (guitar), Chris Leal (bass), Chris Webb (drums), Gabriel Gonzalez (trumpet), [[Starpool|Alan Meade]] (trumpet), and Tony Meade (saxophone). They practiced in Eric's parents' garage.<ref name=\"orangeCoast\" />\n\n[[Tony Kanal]] went to one of the band's early shows, and soon joined the band as its bassist.

The lawsuit alleged that the game had \"transformed No Doubt band members into a virtual karaoke circus act\", singing dozens of songs the group neither wrote, popularized, nor approved for use in the game. The case was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and cited [[Activision]], the game's distributor, as having exceeded contractual likenesses of the members of No Doubt.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/11/no-doubt-sues-activision-over-band-hero.html |title=No Doubt sues Activision over Band Hero |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=2009-11-04 |access-date=2010-01-01}}</ref>\n\nOn February 15, 2011, the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District]] affirmed the trial court's denial of Activision's special motion to strike No Doubt's lawsuit as a [[strategic lawsuit against public participation]], after an [[interlocutory appeal]] by Activision.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants=No Doubt v.

The court then explained: \"The band also learned that female lead singer Gwen Stefani's avatar could be made to sing in a male voice, and the male band members' avatars could be manipulated to sing songs in female voices. The individual band member avatars could be made to perform solo, without their band members, as well as with members of other groups.\" The court then ruled that Activision's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] defense was meritless, No Doubt had a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits, and that No Doubt was entitled to recover costs and attorney's fees incurred in opposing Activision's appeal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\nIn 2012, the issue was settled out of court, two weeks before scheduled trial date.<ref>{{Cite
