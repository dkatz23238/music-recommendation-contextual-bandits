He has an older brother, Mark, and a younger sister, Joanne.<ref name=\"Home\"/> As a youth, after school, he played football for the [[Vauxhall Motors]] factory and in his spare time played in several bands as a bass guitarist.\n\nThe first group for which he became lead singer was Kat Kool & the Kool Kats. In the late 1970s, he joined [[Streetband]], who had one [[UK Singles Chart|top 20 hit in the UK]], with the humorous, novelty track \"[[Toast (Streetband song)|Toast]]\".<ref name=\"Official Charts\"/> In December 1979, Streetband disbanded.\n\nThe ex-Streetbanders added new recruits Dave Lathwell on guitar and Baz Watts on drums and became Q-Tips. In addition, a four piece [[brass section]] was created by Steve Farr ([[baritone saxophone]]), Richard Blanchard ([[tenor saxophone]]), Stuart Van Blandamer ([[alto saxophone]]) and Tony Hughes (trumpet), who all hailed from the [[North London]] and [[Hertfordshire]] area, while [[Electronic organ|organist]] Ian Kewley lived in [[Essex]]. Q-Tips' name derived from a well-known brand of [[cotton buds]].\n\nQ-Tips's first rehearsals took place in November 1979. Their first concert was on 18 November 1979 at the Queens Arms Hotel in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]]. This was followed by another at the Horn of Plenty in [[St Albans]]&nbsp;-&nbsp;a regular gig for Streetband during 1978&nbsp;-&nbsp;and a total of 16 in their first month of existence. Some personnel changes occurred during the first six months, with Blanchard and Lathwell leaving the band.\n\nBy 1 April 1980, the band had recorded two tracks, \"SYSLJFM (The Letter Song)\", and \"Having a Party\", both recorded at the Livingstone Studios in [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]]. Constant touring and concert appearances had built a strong fan base by mid-1981, when the small amount of [[soul music]] covers were outnumbered by the band's own tracks.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll |title=Q-Tips |author=Huey, Steve|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The professionalism of the band had attracted the attention of several record labels, with the late [[Mickie Most]] ([[RAK Records]]) confirming on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''Round Table'' programme that Q-Tips \"...are easily the best live band working at the moment\".

This line-up remained for the rest of the band's career. They appeared on [[BBC Television]]'s ''In Concert'', ''[[Rock Goes to College]]'' and ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'' in the latter part of 1981.  Other television appearances included children's Saturday morning TV. Q-Tips opened for [[the J. Geils Band]], [[the Knack]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Bob Marley]] and the [[Average White Band]].\n\nThe band toured with [[After the Fire]], and supported [[the Who]] on their 12-date UK tour in 1980. In 1981, Q-Tips played the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. With poor record sales after the release of two albums and seven singles, the Q-Tips broke up in early 1982 when Paul Young signed a solo [[recording contract]] with [[Columbia Records|CBS]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In late 1982 and early 1983, the brass section and drummer of Q-Tips toured with [[Adam Ant]] on the UK and US legs of his ''[[Friend or Foe (album)|Friend or Foe]]'' tour, and some remained for Ant's 1984 ''[[Strip (Adam Ant album)|Strip]]'' tour.\n\nYoung briefly teamed up again with Q-Tips for a reunion tour in 1993.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Solo career and pop stardom==\nThe Q-Tips disbanded in 1982, and Young was signed by [[Columbia Records]] as a solo performer.
