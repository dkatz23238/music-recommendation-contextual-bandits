Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of Indian instruments, such as [[sitar]], on numerous Beatles songs, starting with \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974; he co-founded [[HandMade Films]] in 1978, initially to produce the [[Monty Python]] troupe's [[comedy film]] ''[[The Life of Brian]]''.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|access-date=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archive-date=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977.

Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his home, [[Friar Park]]. His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganga in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.
