Isis was first mentioned in the [[Old Kingdom]] ({{circa|2686|2181&nbsp;BCE}}) as one of the main characters of the [[Osiris myth]], in which she resurrects her slain brother and husband, the divine king [[Osiris]], and produces and protects his heir, [[Horus]]. She was believed to help the dead enter the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]] as she had helped Osiris, and she was considered the divine mother of the [[pharaoh]], who was likened to Horus. Her [[maternal]] aid was invoked in healing [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] to benefit ordinary people. Originally, she played a limited role in royal rituals and [[Egyptian temple|temple]] rites, although she was more prominent in [[ancient Egyptian burial customs|funerary practices]] and magical texts. She was usually portrayed in art as a human woman wearing a throne-like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] on her head. During the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] ({{circa|1550|1070&nbsp;BCE}}), as she took on traits that originally belonged to [[Hathor]], the preeminent goddess of earlier times, Isis was portrayed wearing Hathor's headdress: a sun disk between the horns of a [[cattle in religion and mythology|cow]].\n\nIn the first millennium BCE, Osiris and Isis became the most widely worshipped Egyptian deities, and Isis absorbed traits from many other goddesses. Rulers in Egypt and its neighbor to the south, [[Nubia]], built temples dedicated primarily to Isis, and her temple at [[Philae]] was a religious center for Egyptians and Nubians alike. Her reputed [[heku|magical power]] was greater than that of all other gods, and she was said to protect the kingdom from its enemies, govern the skies and the natural world, and have power over [[fate]] itself.\n\nIn the [[Hellenistic period]] (323\u201330 BCE), when Egypt was ruled and settled by [[Greeks]], Isis was worshipped by Greeks and Egyptians, along with a new god, [[Serapis]]. Their worship diffused into the wider Mediterranean world. Isis's Greek devotees ascribed to her traits taken from [[Greek deities]], such as the invention of marriage and the protection of ships at sea, and she retained strong links with Egypt and other Egyptian deities who were popular in the Hellenistic world, such as Osiris and [[Harpocrates]]. As Hellenistic culture was absorbed by [[ancient Rome|Rome]] in the first century BCE, the [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] of Isis became a part of [[religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. Her devotees were a small proportion of the [[Roman Empire]]'s population but were found all across its territory. Her following developed distinctive [[Roman festival|festivals]] such as the [[Navigium Isidis]], as well as [[mysteries of Isis|initiation ceremonies]] resembling those of other [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery cults]]. Some of her devotees said she encompassed all feminine divine powers in the world.\n\nThe worship of Isis was ended by the rise of [[Christianity]] in the fourth through sixth centuries CE. Her worship may have influenced Christian beliefs and practices such as the [[veneration of Mary]], but the evidence for this influence is ambiguous and often controversial. Isis continues to appear in [[Western culture]], particularly in [[Western esotericism|esotericism]] and [[modern Paganism]], often as a [[Veil of Isis|personification of nature]] or the feminine aspect of divinity.\n\n==In Egypt and Nubia==\n\n===Name and origins===\nWhereas some [[ancient Egyptian deities|Egyptian deities]] appeared in the late [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic Period]] (before c. 3100 BCE), neither Isis nor her husband [[Osiris]] were mentioned by name before the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] (c. 2494\u20132345 BCE).{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=12\u201314, 146}}{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|p=41}} An inscription that may refer to Isis dates to the reign of [[Nyuserre Ini]] during that period,{{sfn|M\u00fcnster|1968|p=159}} and she appears prominently in the [[Pyramid Texts]], which began to be written down at the end of the dynasty and whose content may have developed much earlier.{{sfn|Pinch|2002|pp=9\u201311}} Several passages in the Pyramid Texts link Isis with the region of the [[Nile Delta]] near [[Behbeit el-Hagar]] and [[Sebennytos]], and her [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] may have originated there.{{sfn|M\u00fcnster|1968|p=158}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The worship of a particular god, such as Isis, within ancient Egyptian religion is termed a \"[[cult (religious practice)|cult]]\".{{sfn|Teeter|2001|p=340}} The same is often true for the worship of individual gods within Greek or Roman religion. Classicists sometimes refer to the veneration of Isis, or of certain other deities who were introduced to the Greco-Roman world, as \"religions\" because they were more distinct from the culture around them than the cults of Greek or Roman gods.{{sfn|Alvar|2008|pp=2\u20134}} However, these cults did not form the kind of independent, self-contained communities with distinct worldviews that [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] groups in the Roman Empire did.{{sfn|Burkert|1987|pp=51\u201353}} [[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and [[Jaime Alvar]] have both argued that the worship of Isis should be called a \"cult\", because it formed a part of the wider systems of Greek and Roman religion, rather than an independent, all-encompassing system of beliefs like Judaism or Christianity.{{sfn|Alvar|2008|pp=2\u20134}}{{sfn|Dunand|2010|pp=40\u201341, 50\u201351}} }}\n\nMany scholars have focused on Isis's name in trying to determine her origins. Her [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was ''\ua723st'', which became {{coptic|\u2c8e\u2ca4\u2c88}} (''\u0112se'') in the [[Coptic language|Coptic form of Egyptian]], ''Wusa'' in the [[Meroitic language]] of Nubia, and \u1f3e\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, on which her modern name is based, in [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]].{{sfn|Quack|2018|pp=108\u2013109}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Originally the first consonant in the name, ''\ua723'', was pronounced as ''r'' or ''l''. By the time of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] it had weakened to a [[glottal stop]] sound, and the ''t'' at the end of words had disappeared from speech, so in the New Kingdom the pronunciation of Isis's name was similar to ''Usa''. Forms of her name in other languages all descend from this pronunciation.{{sfn|Quack|2018|pp=108\u2013109}} The Meroitic forms of her name, {{Script|Mero|\ud802\udda5\ud802\udda3\ud802\uddaf}} ''Wos[a]'' or {{Script|Mero|\ud802\udda0\ud802\uddaf}} ''As[a]'', indicate the pronunciation /u\u02d0\u0255a/.{{sfn|Rilly|de Vogt|2012|p=37}} }} The [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] writing of her name incorporates the sign for a throne, which Isis also wears on her head as a sign of her identity. The symbol serves as a [[phonogram (linguistics)|phonogram]], spelling the ''st'' sounds in her name, but it may have also represented a link with actual thrones. The Egyptian term for a throne was also ''st'' and may have shared a common [[etymology]] with Isis's name. Therefore, the Egyptologist [[Kurt Sethe]] suggested she was originally a personification of thrones.{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|pp=91, 95\u201397}} [[Henri Frankfort]] agreed, believing that the throne was considered the king's mother, and thus a goddess, because of its power to make a man into a king.{{sfn|Frankfort|1978|pp=43\u201344, 108}} Other scholars, such as J\u00fcrgen Osing and Klaus P. Kuhlmann, have disputed this interpretation, because of dissimilarities between Isis's name and the word for a throne{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|pp=91, 95\u201397}} or a lack of evidence that the throne was ever deified.{{sfn|Kuhlmann|2011|p=2}}\n\n===Roles===\nThe [[Osiris myth|cycle of myth surrounding Osiris's death and resurrection]] was first recorded in the Pyramid Texts and grew into the most elaborate and influential of all [[Egyptian myths]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=119}} Isis plays a more active role in this myth than the other protagonists, so as it developed in [[ancient Egyptian literature|literature]] from the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BCE) to the [[Ptolemaic Period]] (305\u201330 BCE), she became the most complex literary character of all Egyptian deities.{{sfn|Vinson|2008|pp=313\u2013316}} At the same time, she absorbed characteristics from many other goddesses, broadening her significance well beyond the Osiris myth.{{sfn|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=235\u2013237}}\n\n====Wife and mourner====\n[[File:Terre cuite pleureuse Louvre E27247.jpg|thumb|alt=Terracotta sculpture of a woman with her arm flung across her forehead|Sculpture of a woman, possibly Isis, in a pose of mourning; fifteenth or fourteenth century BCE]]\nIsis is part of the [[Ennead of Heliopolis]], a family of nine deities descended from the creator god, [[Atum]] or [[Ra]]. She and her siblings\u2014Osiris, [[Set (mythology)|Set]], and [[Nephthys]]\u2014are the last generation of the Ennead, born to [[Geb]], god of the earth, and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], goddess of the sky. The creator god, the world's original ruler, passes down his authority through the male generations of the Ennead, so that Osiris becomes king. Isis, who is Osiris's [[Sibling relationship#Sibling marriage and incest|wife as well as his sister]], is his queen.{{sfn|Pinch|2002|pp=66, 68, 76\u201378}}\n\nSet kills Osiris and, in several versions of the story, dismembers his corpse. Isis and Nephthys, along with other deities such as [[Anubis]], search for the pieces of their brother's body and reassemble it. Their efforts are the mythic prototype for [[mummification]] and other [[ancient Egyptian funerary practices]].{{sfn|Pinch|2002|pp=79\u201380, 178\u2013179}} According to some texts, they must also protect Osiris's body from further desecration by Set or his servants.{{sfn|Pinch|2002|pp=80, 150}} Isis is the epitome of a mourning widow. Her and Nephthys's love and grief for their brother help restore him to life, as does Isis's recitation of [[Spell (paranormal)|magical spells]].{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=32\u201336, 115\u2013118}} [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts|Funerary texts]] contain speeches by Isis in which she expresses her sorrow at Osiris's death, her sexual desire for him, and even anger that he has left her. All these emotions play a part in his revival, as they are meant to stir him into action.{{sfn|Smith|2009|pp=54\u201355, 97\u201399}} Finally, Isis restores breath and life to Osiris's body and copulates with him, conceiving their son, [[Horus]].{{sfn|Pinch|2002|pp=79\u201380, 178\u2013179}} After this point Osiris lives on only in the [[Duat]], or underworld. But by producing a son and heir to avenge his death and carry out funerary rites for him, Isis has ensured that her husband will endure in the afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2001|pp=129\u2013131, 144\u2013145}}\n\nIsis's role in [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife beliefs]] was based on that in the myth. She helped to restore the souls of deceased humans to wholeness as she had done for Osiris. Like other goddesses, such as [[Hathor]], she also acted as a mother to the deceased, providing protection and nourishment.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013228}} Thus, like Hathor, she sometimes took the form of [[Imentet]], the goddess of the west, who welcomed the deceased soul into the afterlife as her child.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=151\u2013154}} But for much of Egyptian history, male deities such as Osiris were believed to provide the regenerative powers, including sexual potency, that were crucial for rebirth. Isis was thought to merely assist by stimulating this power.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013228}} Feminine divine powers became more important in afterlife beliefs in the late New Kingdom.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=235\u2013236}} Various Ptolemaic funerary texts emphasize that Isis took the active role in Horus's conception by sexually stimulating her inert husband,{{sfn|Smith|2009|pp=119, 141}} some tomb decoration from the [[Roman Egypt|Roman period in Egypt]] depicts Isis in a central role in the afterlife,{{sfn|Venit|2010|pp=98, 107}} and a funerary text from that era suggests that women were thought able to join the retinue of Isis and Nephthys in the afterlife.{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=386}}\n\n====Mother goddess====\n[[File:Egyptian - Isis with Horus the Child - Walters 54416 - Three Quarter Right.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Small statue of a seated woman, with a headdress of horns and a disk, holding an infant across her lap|Isis nursing [[Horus]], a sculpture from the 7th century BCE.]]\nIsis is treated as the mother of Horus even in the earliest copies of the Pyramid Texts.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=158\u2013159}} Yet there are signs that Hathor was originally regarded as his mother,{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|pp=14\u201317}} and other traditions make an elder form of Horus the son of Nut and a sibling of Isis and Osiris.{{sfn|Griffiths|1970|pp=300\u2013301}} Isis may only have come to be Horus's mother as the Osiris myth took shape during the Old Kingdom,{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|pp=14\u201317}} but through her relationship with him she came to be seen as the epitome of maternal devotion.{{sfn|Pinch|2002|p=149}}\n\nIn the developed form of the myth, Isis gives birth to Horus, after a long pregnancy and a difficult labor, in the [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] thickets of the Nile Delta. As her child grows she must protect him from Set and many other hazards\u2014snakes, scorpions, and simple illness.{{sfn|Pinch|2002|pp=80\u201381, 146}} In some texts, Isis travels among humans and must seek their help. According to one such story, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard her. They take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for the goddess to heal the blameless child.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=82, 86\u201387}} Isis's reputation as a compassionate deity, willing to relieve human suffering, contributed greatly to her appeal.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=182}}\n\nIsis continues to assist her son when he challenges Set to claim the kingship that Set has usurped,{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=176}} although mother and son are sometimes portrayed in conflict, as when Horus beheads Isis and she replaces her original head with that of a cow\u2014an [[origin myth]] explaining the cow-horn headdress that Isis wears.{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=189}}\n\nIsis's maternal aspect extended to other deities as well. The [[Coffin Texts]] from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055\u20131650 BCE) say the [[Four sons of Horus]], funerary deities who were thought to protect the internal organs of the deceased, were the offspring of Isis and the elder form of Horus.{{sfn|Pinch|2002|p=145}} In the same era, Horus was syncretized with the [[list of fertility deities|fertility god]] [[Min (god)|Min]], so Isis was regarded as Min's mother.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=115}} A form of Min known as Kamutef, \"bull of his mother\", who represented the cyclical regeneration of the gods and of kingship, was said to impregnate his mother to engender himself.{{sfn|Traunecker|2001|pp=221\u2013222}} Thus, Isis was also regarded as Min's consort.{{sfn|M\u00fcnster|1968|pp=134\u2013135}} The same ideology of kingship may lie behind a tradition, found in a few texts, that Horus raped Isis.{{sfn|Griffiths|1960|pp=48\u201350}}{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|p=67}} [[Amun]], the foremost Egyptian deity during the Middle and New Kingdoms, also took on the role of Kamutef, and when he was in this form, Isis often acted as his consort.{{sfn|M\u00fcnster|1968|pp=134\u2013135}} [[Apis (god)|Apis]], a bull that was worshipped as a living god at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], was said to be Isis's son, fathered by a form of Osiris known as Osiris-Apis. The biological mother of each Apis bull was thus known as the \"Isis cow\".{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=393}} Isis was said to be the mother of [[Bastet]] by [[Ra]].{{sfn|Pinch|2002|p=115}}\n\nA story in the [[Westcar Papyrus]] from the Middle Kingdom includes Isis among a group of goddesses who serve as midwives during the delivery of three future kings.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=180\u2013181}} She serves a similar role in New Kingdom texts that describe the divinely ordained births of reigning pharaohs.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\nIn the Westcar Papyrus, Isis calls out the names of the three children as they are born. Barbara S. Lesko sees this story as a sign that Isis had the power to predict or influence future events, as did other deities who presided over birth,{{sfn|M\u00fcnster|1968|pp=134\u2013135}} such as [[Shai]] and [[Renenutet]].{{sfn|Vanderlip|1972|pp=93\u201396}} Texts from much later times call Isis \"mistress of life, ruler of fate and destiny\"{{sfn|M\u00fcnster|1968|pp=134\u2013135}} and indicate she has control over Shai and Renenutet, just as other great deities such as Amun were said to do in earlier eras of Egyptian history. By governing these deities, Isis determined the length and quality of human lives.{{sfn|Vanderlip|1972|pp=93\u201396}}\n\n====Goddess of kingship and protection of the kingdom====\n[[File:Abydos Tempelrelief Sethos I. 15.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Relief of a seated woman with an elaborate headdress. In her lap is a child with a cap-shaped crown whose head she cradles.|Isis holds the king, [[Seti I]], in her lap, thirteenth century BCE]]\nHorus was equated with each living pharaoh and Osiris with the pharaoh's deceased predecessors. Isis was therefore the mythological mother and wife of kings. In the Pyramid Texts her primary importance to the king was as one of the deities who protected and assisted him in the afterlife. Her prominence in royal ideology grew in the New Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=159, 170}} Temple reliefs from that time on show the king nursing at Isis's breast; her milk not only healed her child, but symbolized his divine right to rule.{{sfn|Assmann|2001|p=134}} Royal ideology increasingly emphasized the importance of queens as earthly counterparts of the goddesses who served as wives to the king and mothers to his heirs. Initially the most important of these goddesses was Hathor, whose attributes in art were incorporated into queens' crowns. But because of her own mythological links with queenship, Isis too was given the same titles and regalia as human queens.{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=68\u201370}}\n\nIsis's actions in protecting Osiris against Set became part of a larger, more warlike aspect of her character.{{sfn|\u017dabkar|1988|pp=60\u201362, 72}} New Kingdom funerary texts portray Isis in the barque of Ra as he sails through the underworld, acting as one of several deities who subdue Ra's archenemy, [[Apep]].{{sfn|\u017dabkar|1988|pp=73\u201374, 81\u201382}} Kings also called upon her [[apotropaic|protective magical power]] against human enemies. In her Ptolemaic temple at [[Philae]], which lay near the frontier with [[Nubia]]n peoples who raided Egypt, she was described as the protectress of the entire nation, more effective in battle than \"millions of soldiers\", supporting Ptolemaic kings and Roman emperors in their efforts to subdue Egypt's enemies.{{sfn|\u017dabkar|1988|pp=60\u201362, 72}}\n\n====Goddess of magic and wisdom====\nIsis was also known for her [[heku|magical power]], which enabled her to revive Osiris and to protect and heal Horus, and for her cunning.{{sfn|Pinch|2002|p=151}} By virtue of her magical knowledge, she was said to be \"more clever than a million gods\".{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|p=98}}{{sfn|Hart|2005|pp=81\u201382}} In several episodes in the New Kingdom story \"[[The Contendings of Horus and Set]]\", Isis uses these abilities to outmaneuver Set during his conflict with her son. On one occasion, she transforms into a young woman who tells Set she is involved in an inheritance dispute similar to Set's usurpation of Osiris's crown. When Set calls this situation unjust, Isis taunts him, saying he has judged himself to be in the wrong.{{sfn|Hart|2005|pp=81\u201382}} In later texts, she uses her powers of transformation to fight and destroy Set and his followers.{{sfn|Pinch|2002|p=151}}\n\nMany stories about Isis appear as ''[[historiolae]]'', prologues to magical texts that describe mythic events related to the goal that the spell aims to accomplish.{{sfn|Vinson|2008|pp=313\u2013316}} In one spell, Isis creates a snake that bites Ra, who is older and greater than she is, and makes him ill with its venom. She offers to cure Ra if he will tell her his [[true name|true, secret name]]\u2014a piece of knowledge that carries with it incomparable power. After much coercion, Ra tells her his name, which she passes on to Horus, bolstering his royal authority.{{sfn|Hart|2005|pp=81\u201382}} The story may be meant as an origin story to explain why Isis's magical ability surpasses that of other deities, but because she uses magic to subdue Ra, the story seems to treat her as having such abilities even before learning his name.{{sfn|Baines|1996|p=371}}\n\n====Sky goddess====\nMany of the roles Isis acquired gave her an important position in the sky.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=147}} Passages in the Pyramid Texts connect Isis closely with [[Sopdet]], the goddess representing the star [[Sirius]], whose relationship with her husband [[Sah (god)|Sah]]\u2014the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]\u2014and their son [[Sopdu]] parallels Isis's relations with Osiris and Horus.

At their peak in the late second and early third centuries CE, Isis and Serapis were worshipped in most towns across the western empire, though without much presence in the countryside.{{sfn|Bricault|2000|p=206}} Their temples were found from [[Petra]] and [[Palmyra]], in the [[Arabia Petraea|Arabian]] and [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]] provinces, to [[Italica]] in [[Hispania|Spain]] and [[Londinium]] in [[Roman Britain|Britain]].{{sfn|Bricault|2001|pp=174\u2013179}} By this time they were on a comparable footing with native Roman deities.{{sfn|Donalson|2003|pp=177, 180\u2013182}}\n\n===Roles===\n[[File:Marble statue of Isis, the goddess holds a situla and sistrum, ritual implements used in her worship, from 117 until 138 AD, found at Hadrian's Villa (Pantanello), Palazzo Nuovo, Capitoline Museums (12945630725).jpg|thumb|alt=Marble staue of a woman holding a rattle in one hand and a pitcher in the other.|Roman statue of Isis, first or second century CE.

She governs the cosmos, yet she also relieves people of their comparatively trivial misfortunes, and her influence extends into the realm of death, which is \"individual and universal at the same time\".{{sfn|Gasparini|2011|pp=700, 716\u2013717}}\n\n===Relationships with other deities===\n[[File:Pompeii - Temple of Isis - Io and Isis - MAN.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Fresco of a seated woman with a cobra wrapped around her arm grasping the hand of a standing woman with small horns on her head|Isis welcoming [[Io (mythology)|Io]] to Egypt, from a fresco at [[Pompeii]], first century CE]]\nMore than a dozen Egyptian deities were worshipped outside Egypt in Hellenistic and Roman times in a series of interrelated cults, though many were fairly minor.{{sfn|Versluys|2007|pp=3\u20134}} Of the most important of these deities, Serapis was closely connected with Isis and often appeared with her in art, but Osiris remained central to her myth and prominent in her rituals.{{sfn|Tak\u00e1cs|1995|pp=28\u201329}} Temples to Isis and Serapis sometimes stood next to each other, but it was rare for a single temple to be dedicated to both.{{sfn|Renberg|2017|p=331}} Osiris, as a dead deity unlike the immortal gods of Greece, seemed strange to Greeks and played only a minor role in Egyptian cults in Hellenistic times. In Roman times he became, like Dionysus, a symbol of a joyous afterlife, and the Isis cult increasingly focused on him.{{sfn|Bommas|2012|pp=425, 430\u2013431}} Horus, often under the name [[Harpocrates]], also appeared in Isis's temples as her son by Osiris or Serapis.

However, the word\u2014''Isiacus'' or \"Isiac\"\u2014was rarely used.{{sfn|Beard|North|Price|1998|pp=236, 307\u2013309}}\n\nIsiacs were a very small proportion of the Roman Empire's population,{{sfn|Alvar|2008|pp=32\u201333}} but they came from every [[social class in ancient Rome|level of society]], from [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] and [[freedmen]] to high officials and members of the imperial family.{{sfn|Tak\u00e1cs|1995|pp=5\u20136}} Ancient accounts imply that Isis was popular with lower social classes, providing a possible reason why authorities in the Roman Republic, troubled by struggles between classes, regarded her cult with suspicion.{{sfn|Orlin|2010|p=206}} Women were more strongly represented in the Isis cult than in most Greco-Roman cults, and in imperial times, they could serve as priestesses in many of the same positions in the hierarchy as their male counterparts.{{sfn|Heyob|1975|p=87}} Women make up much less than half of the Isiacs known from inscriptions and are rarely listed among the higher ranks of priests,{{sfn|Heyob|1975|pp=95\u201396}} but because women are underrepresented in Roman inscriptions, their participation may have been greater than is recorded.{{sfn|Kraemer|1992|p=76}} Several Roman writers accused Isis's cult of encouraging promiscuity among women.

They were decorated with Egyptian-themed artwork, sometimes including antiquities imported from Egypt. Their layout was more elaborate than that of traditional Roman temples and included rooms for housing priests and for various ritual functions, with a cult statue of the goddess in a secluded sanctuary.{{sfn|Bommas|2012|p=430}}{{sfn|Turcan|1996|pp=104\u2013109}} Unlike Egyptian cult images, Isis's Hellenistic and Roman statues were life-size or larger. The daily ritual still entailed dressing the statue in elaborate clothes each morning and offering it libations, but in contrast with Egyptian tradition, the priests allowed ordinary devotees of Isis to see the cult statue during the morning ritual, pray to it directly, and sing hymns before it.{{sfn|Donalson|2003|pp=34\u201335, 39}}\n\nAnother object of veneration in these temples was water, which was treated as a symbol of the waters of the Nile. Isis temples built in Hellenistic times often included underground cisterns that stored this [[Sacred waters|sacred water]], raising and lowering the water level in imitation of the Nile flood. Many Roman temples instead used a pitcher of water that was worshipped as a cult image or manifestation of Osiris.{{sfn|Wild|1981|pp=60\u201361, 154\u2013157}}\n\n====Personal worship====\nRoman ''[[lararia]]'', or household shrines, contained statuettes of the ''[[penates]]'', a varied group of protective deities chosen based on the preferences of the members of the household.{{sfn|Bodel|2008|pp=258, 261\u2013262}} Isis and other Egyptian deities were found in ''lararia'' in Italy from the late first century BCE{{sfn|Alvar|2008|p=192}} to the beginning of the fourth century CE.{{sfn|Bodel|2008|p=261}}\n\nThe cult asked both ritual and moral purity of its devotees, periodically requiring ritual baths or days-long periods of sexual abstinence. Isiacs sometimes displayed their piety on irregular occasions, singing Isis's praises in the streets or, as a form of [[penance]], declaring their misdeeds in public.{{sfn|B\u00f8gh|2015|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nSome temples to Greek deities, including Serapis, practiced [[incubation (ritual)|incubation]], in which worshippers slept in a temple hoping that the god would appear to them in a dream and give them advice or heal their ailments. Some scholars believe that this practice took place in Isis's temples, but there is no firm evidence that it did.{{sfn|Renberg|2017|pp=392\u2013393}} Isis was, however, thought to communicate through dreams in other circumstances, including to call worshippers to undergo initiation.{{sfn|B\u00f8gh|2015|p=278}}\n\n====Initiation====\n{{main|Mysteries of Isis}}\nSome temples of Isis performed [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery rites]] to [[religious initiation rites|initiate]] new members of the cult. These rites were claimed to be of Egyptian origin and may have drawn on the secretive tendencies of some Egyptian rites.{{sfn|Griffiths|1970|pp=42\u201343}} However, they were mainly based on Greek mystery cults, especially the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] dedicated to Demeter, colored with Egyptian elements.{{sfn|Burkert|1987|p=41}}{{sfn|Bremmer|2014|p=116}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The mystery rites may have emerged as part of the Hellenization of Isis under the Ptolemies in the third century BCE,{{sfn|Alvar|2008|pp=58\u201361}} in Greece under the influence of the cult of Demeter in the first century BCE,{{sfn|Pakkanen|1996|pp=78\u201382}} or as late as the first or second century CE.{{sfn|Bremmer|2014|pp=113\u2013114}} Even after the initiation ceremony had developed, few texts in Egypt referred to it.{{sfn|Venit|2010|p=90}}}} Although mystery rites are among the best-known elements of Isis's Greco-Roman cult, they are only known to have been performed in Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor.{{sfn|Bremmer|2014|pp=113\u2013114}} By giving the devotee a dramatic, mystical experience of the goddess, initiations added emotional intensity to the process of joining her following.{{sfn|B\u00f8gh|2015|p=278}}\n\n''The Golden Ass'', in describing how the protagonist joins Isis's cult, gives the only detailed account of Isiac initiation.{{sfn|Burkert|1987|p=97}} Apuleius's motives for writing about the cult and the accuracy of his fictionalized description are much debated. But the account is broadly consistent with other evidence about initiations, and scholars rely heavily on it when studying the subject.{{sfn|Bowden|2010|pp=165\u2013167, 179\u2013180}}\n\nAncient mystery rites used a variety of intense experiences, such as nocturnal darkness interrupted by bright light and loud music and noise, to overwhelm their senses and give them an intense [[religious experience]] that felt like direct contact with the god they devoted themselves to.{{sfn|Bowden|2010|pp=215\u2013216}} Apuleius's protagonist, Lucius, undergoes a series of initiations, though only the first is described in detail. After entering the innermost part of Isis's temple at night, he says, \"I came to the boundary of death and, having trodden on the threshold of [[Proserpina]], I travelled through all the elements and returned. In the middle of the night I saw the sun flashing with bright light, I came face to face with the gods below and the gods above and paid reverence to them from close at hand.\"{{sfn|Hanson|1989|p=341}} This cryptic description suggests that the initiate's symbolic journey to the world of the dead was likened to Osiris's rebirth, as well as to Ra's journey through the underworld in Egyptian myth,{{sfn|Griffiths|1975|pp=315\u2013317}} possibly implying that Isis brought the initiate back from death as she did her husband.{{sfn|Turcan|1996|p=121}}\n\n====Festivals====\nRoman calendars listed the two most important [[Roman festival|festivals]] of Isis as early as the first century CE. The first festival was the [[Navigium Isidis]] in March, which celebrated Isis's influence over the sea and served as a prayer for the safety of seafarers and, eventually, of the Roman people and their leaders.{{sfn|Salzman|1990|pp=169\u2013175}} It consisted of an elaborate procession, including Isiac priests and devotees with a wide variety of costumes and sacred emblems, carrying a model ship from the local Isis temple to the sea{{sfn|Donalson|2003|pp=68\u201373}} or to a nearby river.{{sfn|Alvar|2008|p=299}} The other was the [[Isia (festival)|Isia]] in late October and early November. Like its Egyptian forerunner, the Khoiak festival, the Isia included a ritual reenactment of Isis's search for Osiris, followed by jubilation when the god's body was found.{{sfn|Alvar|2008|pp=300\u2013302}} Several more minor festivals were dedicated to Isis, including the [[Pelusia]] in late March that may have celebrated the birth of Harpocrates, and the [[Lychnapsia]], or lamp-lit festival, that celebrated Isis's own birth on August 12.{{sfn|Salzman|1990|pp=169\u2013175}}\n\nFestivals of Isis and other polytheistic deities were celebrated throughout the fourth century CE, despite the [[Christianization of the Roman Empire|growth of Christianity]] in that era and the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|persecution of pagans]] that intensified toward the end of the century.{{sfn|Salzman|1990|pp=232\u2013236}} The Isia was celebrated at least as late as 417 CE,{{sfn|Turcan|1996|p=128}} and the Navigium Isidis lasted well into the sixth century.{{sfn|Salzman|1990|p=239}} Increasingly, the religious meaning of all Roman festivals was forgotten or ignored even as the customs continued. In some cases, these customs became part of the combined classical and Christian culture of the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Salzman|1990|pp=240\u2013246}}\n\n==Possible influence on Christianity==\n[[File:Figure-6-Fresco-of-Isis-lactans-at-Karanis-fourth-century-CE-Karanis-Tran-Tam-Tinh.png|thumb|right|upright|alt=Painting of a seated woman with a child in her lap, offering one of her breasts to the child|Isis Lactans holding Harpocrates in an Egyptian fresco from the fourth century CE]]\nA contentious question about Isis is whether her cult influenced Christianity.{{sfn|Alvar|2008|p=30}} Some Isiac customs may have been among the pagan religious practices that were [[Interpretatio Christiana|incorporated into Christian traditions]] as the Roman Empire was Christianized. [[Andreas Alf\u00f6ldi]], for instance, argued in the 1930s that the medieval [[Carnival]] festival, in which a model boat was carried, developed from the Navigium Isidis.{{sfn|Salzman|1990|p=240}}\n\nMuch attention focuses on whether traits of Christianity were borrowed from pagan mystery cults, including that of Isis.{{sfn|Alvar|2008|pp=383\u2013385}} The more devoted members of Isis's cult made a personal commitment to a deity they regarded as superior to others, as Christians did.{{sfn|Beard|North|Price|1998|p=286}} Both Christianity and the Isis cult had an initiation rite: the mysteries for Isis, [[baptism]] in Christianity.{{sfn|Bowden|2010|pp=207\u2013210}} One of the mystery cults' shared themes\u2014a god whose [[dying-and-rising deity|death and resurrection]] may be connected with the individual worshipper's well-being in the afterlife\u2014resembles the central theme of Christianity. The suggestion that Christianity's basic beliefs were taken from mystery cults has provoked heated debate for more than 200 years.{{sfn|Alvar|2008|pp=390\u2013394}} In response to these controversies, both Hugh Bowden and Jaime Alvar, scholars who study ancient mystery cults, suggest that similarities between Christianity and the mystery cults were not produced by direct borrowing of ideas but by their common background: the Greco-Roman culture in which they all developed.{{sfn|Bowden|2010|pp=207\u2013210}}{{sfn|Alvar|2008|pp=419\u2013421}}\n\nSimilarities between Isis and [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], have also been scrutinized. They have been subject to controversy between [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant Christians]] and the [[Catholic Church]], as many Protestants have argued that Catholic [[veneration of Mary]] is a remnant of paganism.{{sfn|Benko|1993|pp=1\u20134}} The classicist R. E. Witt saw Isis as the \"great forerunner\" of Mary. He suggested that converts to Christianity who had formerly worshipped Isis would have seen Mary in much the same terms as their traditional goddess. He pointed out that the two had several spheres of influence in common, such as agriculture and the protection of sailors. He compared Mary's title \"[[Mother of God]]\" to Isis's epithet \"mother of the god\", and Mary's \"[[queen of heaven]]\" to Isis's \"[[queen of heaven (antiquity)|queen of heaven]]\".{{sfn|Witt|1997|pp=272\u2013274, 277}} Stephen Benko, a historian of early Christianity, argues that devotion to Mary was deeply influenced by the worship of several goddesses, not just Isis.{{sfn|Benko|1993|pp=263\u2013265}} In contrast, [[John McGuckin]], a [[church historian]], says that Mary absorbed superficial traits from these goddesses, such as iconography, but the fundamentals of her cult were thoroughly Christian.{{sfn|McGuckin|2008|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nImages of Isis with Horus in her lap are often suggested as an influence on the [[Madonna (art)|iconography of Mary]], particularly images of the [[Nursing Madonna|Mary nursing the infant Jesus]], as images of nursing women were rare in the ancient Mediterranean world outside Egypt.{{sfn|Heyob|1975|pp=74\u201376}} Vincent Tran Tam Tinh points out that the latest images of Isis nursing Horus date to the fourth century CE, while the earliest images of Mary nursing Jesus date to the seventh century CE. Sabrina Higgins, drawing on his study, argues that if there is a connection between the iconographies of Isis and Mary, it is limited to images from Egypt.{{sfn|Higgins|2012|pp=72\u201374}} In contrast, Thomas F. Mathews and Norman Muller think Isis's pose in late antique panel paintings influenced several types of Marian icons, inside and outside Egypt.{{sfn|Mathews|Muller|2005|pp=6\u20139}} Elizabeth Bolman says these early Egyptian images of Mary nursing Jesus were meant to emphasize his divinity, much as images of nursing goddesses did in ancient Egyptian iconography.{{sfn|Bolman|2005|pp=17\u201318}} Higgins argues that such similarities prove that images of Isis influenced those of Mary, but not that Christians deliberately adopted Isis's iconography or other elements of her cult.{{sfn|Higgins|2012|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n==Influence in later cultures==\n{{further|Ancient Egypt in the Western imagination|Egyptian influence in popular culture}}\n[[File:Auguste Puttemans Isis 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Statue of a woman on a throne covered by a veil|Isis as a [[veil of Isis|veiled \"goddess of life\"]] at the [[Herbert Hoover National Historic Site]]]]\nThe memory of Isis survived the extinction of her worship. Like the Greeks and Romans, many modern Europeans have regarded ancient Egypt as the home of profound and often mystical wisdom, and this wisdom has often been linked with Isis.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=189\u2013191, 195\u2013196}} [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s biography of Isis in his 1374 work ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', based on classical sources, treated her as a historical queen who taught skills of civilization to humankind. Some [[Renaissance]] thinkers elaborated this perspective on Isis. [[Annio da Viterbo]], in the 1490s, claimed Isis and Osiris had civilized Italy before Greece, thus drawing a direct connection between his home country and Egypt. The [[Borgia Apartments]] painted for Annio's patron, [[Pope Alexander VI]], incorporate this same theme in their illustrated rendition of the Osiris myth.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=78, 83\u201386}}\n\n[[Western esotericism]] has often made reference to Isis. Two Roman esoteric texts used the mythic motif in which Isis passes down secret knowledge to Horus. In ''[[Kore Kosmou]]'', she teaches him wisdom passed down from [[Hermes Trismegistus]],{{sfn|van den Broek|2006|p=478}} and in the early [[alchemical]] text ''[[Isis the Prophetess to Her Son Horus]]'', she gives him alchemical recipes.{{sfn|Haage|2006|p=24}} Early modern esoteric literature, which saw Hermes Trismegistus as an Egyptian sage and frequently made use of texts attributed to his hand, sometimes referred to Isis as well.{{sfn|Quentin|2012|pp=148\u2013149}} In a different vein, Apuleius's description of Isiac initiation has influenced the practices of many [[secret societies]].{{sfn|Hornung|2001|p=196}} [[Jean Terrasson]]'s 1731 novel ''[[Life of Sethos|Sethos]]'' used Apuleius as inspiration for a fanciful Egyptian initiation rite dedicated to Isis.{{sfn|Macpherson|2004|p=242}} It was imitated by actual rituals in various [[Masonic]] and Masonic-inspired societies during the eighteenth century, as well as in other literary works, most notably [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s 1791 opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.{{sfn|Spieth|2007|pp=50\u201352}}\n\nFrom the Renaissance on, the [[veil of Isis|veiled statue of Isis]] that Plutarch and Proclus mentioned was interpreted as a personification of [[nature]], based on a passage in the works of [[Macrobius]] in the fifth century CE that equated Isis with nature.{{sfn|Hadot|2006|pp=233\u2013237}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Early modern illustrations of Isis as nature often showed her with multiple breasts. Originally, the [[Temple of Artemis#Ephesian Artemis|form of Artemis]] that was worshipped at [[Ephesus]] was depicted with round protuberances on her chest that came to be interpreted as breasts. Early modern artists drew Isis in this form because Macrobius claimed that both Isis and Artemis were depicted this way.{{sfn|Hadot|2006|pp=233\u2013237}} }} Authors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ascribed a wide variety of meanings to this image. Isis represented nature as the mother of all things, as a set of truths waiting to be unveiled by science, as a symbol of the [[pantheist]] concept of an anonymous, enigmatic deity who was [[immanent]] within nature,{{sfn|Hadot|2006|pp=266\u2013269}} or as an awe-inspiring [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime power]] that could be experienced through ecstatic mystery rites.{{sfn|Assmann|1997|pp=128\u2013135}} In the [[dechristianization of France during the French Revolution]], she served as an alternative to traditional Christianity: a symbol that could represent nature, modern scientific wisdom, and a link to the pre-Christian past.{{sfn|Spieth|2007|pp=91, 140}} For these reasons, Isis's image appeared in artwork sponsored by the [[French First Republic|revolutionary government]], such as the [[Fontaine de la R\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration]], and by the [[First French Empire]].{{sfn|Humbert|2000|pp=175\u2013178}}{{sfn|Quentin|2012|pp=177\u2013180}} The metaphor of Isis's veil continued to circulate through the nineteenth century. [[Helena Blavatsky]], the founder of the esoteric [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] tradition, titled her 1877 book on Theosophy ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', implying that it would reveal spiritual truths about nature that science could not.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2008|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nAmong modern Egyptians, Isis was used as a national symbol during the [[Pharaonism]] movement of the 1920s and 1930s, as Egypt gained independence from [[history of Egypt under the British|British rule]]. In works such as Mohamed Naghi's painting in the [[parliament of Egypt]], titled ''Egypt's Renaissance'', and [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]]'s play ''The Return of the Spirit'', Isis symbolizes the revival of the nation. A sculpture by [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]], also called ''Egypt's Renaissance'', plays upon the motif of Isis's removing her veil.{{sfn|Quentin|2012|pp=225\u2013227}}\n\nIsis is found frequently in works of fiction, such as a [[Isis (DC Comics)|superhero franchise]], and her name and image appear in places as disparate as advertisements and personal names.{{sfn|Humbert|2000|pp=185, 188}} The name ''Isidoros'', meaning \"gift of Isis\" in Greek,{{sfn|Donalson|2003|p=170}} survived in Christianity despite its pagan origins, giving rise to the English name [[Isidore]] and its variants.{{sfn|Witt|1997|p=280}} In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, \"Isis\" itself became a popular feminine [[Isis (given name)|given name]].{{sfn|Khazan|2014}}\n\nIsis continues to appear in modern esoteric and [[modern pagan|pagan]] belief systems. The concept of a single goddess incarnating all feminine divine powers, partly inspired by Apuleius, became a widespread theme in literature of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Hutton|2019|pp=33\u201334}} Influential groups and figures in esotericism, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] in the late nineteenth century and [[Dion Fortune]] in the 1930s, adopted this all-encompassing goddess into their belief systems and called her Isis. This conception of Isis influenced the [[Great Goddess]] found in many forms of [[contemporary witchcraft]].{{sfn|Hutton|2019|pp=82\u201384, 191\u2013192}}{{sfn|Adler|1986|pp=35\u201336, 56}} Today, [[Kemetism|reconstructions of ancient Egyptian religion]], such as [[Kemetic Orthodoxy]]{{sfn|Forrest|2001|p=236}} or the Church of the Eternal Source, include Isis among the deities they revere.{{sfn|Adler|1986|pp=267, 270}} An eclectic religious organization focused on female divinity calls itself the [[Fellowship of Isis]] because, in the words of one of its priestesses, M.
