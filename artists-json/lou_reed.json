He was the guitarist, singer, and principal songwriter for the rock band [[the Velvet Underground]] and had a solo career that spanned five decades. Although not commercially successful during its existence, the Velvet Underground became regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of [[underground music|underground]] and [[alternative rock]] music. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic and transgressive lyrics, and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.\n\nHaving played guitar and sung in [[doo-wop]] groups in high school, Reed studied poetry at [[Syracuse University]] under [[Delmore Schwartz]], and had served as a [[radio DJ]], hosting a late-night [[avant garde music]] program while at college.  After graduating from Syracuse, he went to work for [[Pickwick Records]] in New York City, a low-budget record company that specialized in [[sound-alike]] recordings, as a songwriter and session musician.  A fellow session player at Pickwick was [[John Cale]]; together with [[Sterling Morrison]] and [[Angus MacLise]], they would form the Velvet Underground in 1965.  After building a reputation on the avant garde music scene, they gained the attention of [[Andy Warhol]], who became the band's manager; they in turn became something of a fixture at [[The Factory]], Warhol's art studio, and served as his \"house band\" for various projects.  The band released their [[Velvet Underground & Nico|first album]], now with drummer [[Moe Tucker]] and featuring German singer [[Nico]], in 1967, and parted ways with Warhol shortly thereafter.  Following several line-up changes and three more little heard albums, Reed quit the band in 1970.\n\nAfter leaving the band, Reed would go on to a much more commercially successful solo career, releasing twenty solo studio albums. His second, ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'' (1972), was produced by [[David Bowie]] and arranged by [[Mick Ronson]], and brought him mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the [[glam rock]] genre, anchored by Reed's most successful single, \"[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]\". After ''Transformer'', the less commercial but critically acclaimed ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' peaked at No. 7 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Animal]]'' (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and ''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with ''[[The Blue Mask]]'' (1982) and ''[[New Sensations]]'' (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album ''[[New York (album)|New York]]''.\n\nReed participated in the re-formation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with [[John Cale]] titled ''[[Songs for Drella]]'' which was a tribute to their former mentor [[Andy Warhol]]. ''[[Magic and Loss]]'' (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.\n\nHe contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled ''[[The Raven (Lou Reed album)|The Raven]]''. He married his third wife [[Laurie Anderson]] in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album ''[[Lulu (Lou Reed and Metallica album)|Lulu]]'' with [[Metallica]]. He died in 2013 of [[liver disease]]. Reed has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice; as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996 and as a solo act in 2015.\n\n==Biography==\n===1942\u201357: Early life===\nLewis Allan Reed was born on March 2, 1942, at Beth-El Hospital (later [[Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center|Brookdale]]) in [[Brooklyn]] and grew up in [[Freeport, New York|Freeport, Long Island]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-27/lou-reed-rocker-who-sang-walk-on-the-wild-side-dies-at-71.html |title=Lou Reed, 'Walk on the Wild Side' Rocker, Dies at 71 |newspaper=Bloomberg.com |date=October 27, 2013  |access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref>{{refn|Contrary to some sources, his birth name was Lewis Allan Reed, not Louis Firbanks, a name that was coined as a joke by [[Lester Bangs]] in ''[[Creem]]'' magazine.{{sfnp|Roberts|Reed|2004|p=18}}|group=nb}} Reed was the son of Toby ([[n\u00e9e]] Futterman) (1920\u20132013) and Sidney Joseph Reed (1913\u20132005), an accountant.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Lou_Reed.aspx |title=Lou Reed Facts, information, pictures|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=December 24, 2012}}</ref> His family was [[Jews|Jewish]] and his grandparents were [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jews]] who had fled antisemitism;{{sfnp|Beeber|2006|p=11}} his father had changed his name from Rabinowitz to Reed.{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=}} Reed said that although he was Jewish, his \u201creal god was rock 'n' roll\u201c.<ref name=\"NYROCK1998\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/loureed_int.htm|title=The Gospel According to Lou: Interview with Lou Reed|author=Gabriella|website=Nyrock.com|date=November 1998|access-date=October 27, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031184208/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/loureed_int.htm|archive-date=October 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/lou-reeds-contradictory-jewishness/|title=Lou Reed's paradoxical Jewishness|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=September 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nReed attended Atkinson Elementary School in Freeport and went on to Freeport Junior High School.

His employers felt that the song had hit potential, and assembled a supporting band to help promote the recording. The ''ad hoc'' band, called the Primitives: Reed, Welsh musician [[John Cale]], who had recently moved to New York to study music and was playing viola in composer [[La Monte Young]]'s [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], [[Tony Conrad]] and sculptor [[Walter De Maria]]. Cale and Conrad were surprised to find that for \"The Ostrich\", Reed tuned each string of his guitar to the same note, which they began to call his \"[[ostrich guitar]]\" tuning. This technique created a [[drone (music)|drone]] effect similar to their experimentation in Young's [[avant-garde]] ensemble. Disappointed with Reed's performance, Cale was nevertheless impressed by Reed's early repertoire (including \"[[Heroin (The Velvet Underground song)|Heroin]]\"), and a partnership began to evolve.<ref name=documentary/>\n\nReed and Cale (who played viola, keyboards and bass guitar) lived together on the [[Lower East Side]], and invited Reed's college acquaintance guitarist Sterling Morrison and Cale's neighbor drummer [[Angus MacLise]] to join the band, thus forming [[the Velvet Underground]]. When the opportunity came to play their first paying gig at [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]] in [[Summit, New Jersey]], MacLise quit because he believed that accepting money for art was a [[selling out|sellout]] and did not want to participate in a structured gig. He was replaced on drums by [[Moe Tucker]], the sister of Reed and Morrison's mutual friend Jim Tucker. Initially a fill in for that one show she soon became a full-time member with her drumming an integral part of the band's sound, despite Cale's initial objections.

The single \"[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]\" was a salute to the misfits and hustlers who once surrounded Andy Warhol in the late '60s and appeared in his films.
