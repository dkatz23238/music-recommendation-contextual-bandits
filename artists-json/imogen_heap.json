Her work has been considered pioneering in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[electropop]] music.\n\nHeap classically trained in piano, cello and clarinet starting at a young age. She began writing songs at the age of 13 and, while attending boarding school, taught herself music production. After being discovered by manager Mickey Modern while attending the [[BRIT School]], Heap signed to independent record label [[Almo Sounds]] at the age of 18 and later began working with [[experimental pop]] band [[Acacia (band)|Acacia]]. She released her debut album, an [[alternative rock]] record, ''[[I Megaphone]]'', in 1998. In early 2002, Heap and English record producer [[Guy Sigsworth]] formed the [[Electronic music|electronic]] duo [[Frou Frou (band)|Frou Frou]] and released their only album to date, ''[[Details (album)|Details]]'' (2002).\n\nHer second studio album, ''[[Speak for Yourself]]'', was released in 2005 on her own label, Megaphonic Records, and was [[Music recording certification|certified gold]] in the [[RIAA certification|United States]] and [[Music Canada#Certification awards|Canada]]. The album spawned three singles: \"[[Headlock (song)|Headlock]]\", \"[[Goodnight and Go]]\", which became her highest-charting single as a lead artist on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and \"[[Hide and Seek (Imogen Heap song)|Hide and Seek]]\", which was certified gold in the United States and gained popularity after being used in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[teen drama]] television series ''[[The O.C.]]''. Heap's third studio album, ''[[Ellipse (album)|Ellipse]]'' (2009), peaked in the top five of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and received mostly positive reviews. This was followed by her fourth studio album, ''[[Sparks (Imogen Heap album)|Sparks]]'' (2014). In 2017, she reunited with Sigsworth as part of Frou Frou.\n\nHeap developed the Mi.Mu Gloves, a line of musical gloves, as well as a blockchain-based music-sharing program, Mycelia. She also composed the music for the [[West End theatre|West End]]/[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]''. Over the course of her career, she has received two [[Grammy Award]]s, one [[Ivor Novello Award]], and one [[Drama Desk Award]].

Heap explains that Sigsworth invited her over to his studio to write lyrics to a four-bar motif he had, with one condition \u2013 that she include the word \"love\" somewhere. The first line she came up with was \"lung of love, leaves me breathless\", and the ''[[Details (album)|Details]]'' album track \"Flicks\" was written. A week later, Sigsworth called Heap again, and together they wrote and recorded the future single \"Breathe In\".\n\nOn 4 June 2002, they released ''Details'', their first and only album to date. The album spawned the singles \"Breathe In\", \"It's Good to Be in Love\" and \"Must Be Dreaming\".

Frou Frou saw a resurgence in popularity in 2004, when their album track \"Let Go\" was featured in the film ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'', the soundtrack of which won a [[Grammy]] award.\n\nIn a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou, \"[It] was really like a kind of little holiday from my own work.

It was very organic and spontaneous \u2013 just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own.

Triggered by monsoon rains, the floods left approximately one-fifth of the country of Pakistan under water, affecting over 14&nbsp;million people and damaging or destroying over 900,000 homes. Teaming up with [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Unite]] and Vokle.com, Heap and Ermacora created a webcast/online fundraiser to raise awareness and money for those affected by the floods. Hosted by comedian, creative and Internet personality [[Ze Frank]], the webcast included a series of conversations with [[Cameron Sinclair]] of [[Architecture for Humanity]], [[Gary Slutkin]] and Anders Wilhelmson (and later [[Richard Branson]] and [[Mary Robinson]]), with live performances by musicians [[Ben Folds]], [[Amanda Palmer]], [[Kate Havnevik]], [[KT Tunstall]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Kaki King]], [[Zoe Keating]] and [[Mark Isham]].\n\nThe premise of ''[[Live 4 X]]'' thus established, Heap has since continued to refine the model, organize, host and perform a number of charitable, live-streaming concert events. By integrating live entertainment with educated discussion and technology, ''[[Live 4 X]]'' became an effective charitable outreach tool.\n\nFollowing the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami]] of 2011, Heap told [[Washington Times]] Communities journalist and recording artist Jennifer Grassman that she intended to continue organising ''[[Live 4 X]]'' events to benefit various charitable causes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Imogen Heap & Jennifer Grassman on Japan Tsunami / Earthquake Disaster & Live 4 Sendai|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrvGdsGq08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716004637/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrvGdsGq08|archive-date=16 July 2015|access-date=27 June 2013|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n'''Catalogue of ''Live 4 X'' events to date:'''\n* 31 August 2010 \u2013 ''Live 4 Pakistan'' raised funds for flood relief and recovery in that region.
