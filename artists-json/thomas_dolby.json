He has also worked as a producer and as a [[session musician]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Dolby founded [[Beatnik (company)|Beatnik]], a [[Silicon Valley]] software company whose technology was used to play internet audio and later [[Ringtone|ringtones]], most notably on [[Nokia]] phones. He was also the music director for the [[TED (conference)|TED Conference]].

He adopted the stage name \"Thomas Dolby\" to avoid confusion with British singer [[Tom Robinson]], who was popular when he began his career. Early publicity implied that \"Dolby\" was a middle name, and that Dolby's full name was Thomas Morgan Dolby Robertson;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Stuart |title=Thomas Dolby: A Techno-Geek Aims for 'An Emotional Event'|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|page=4}}</ref> this is legally incorrect, but he does sometimes informally go by the initials TMDR.<ref name=\"fruit\"/>\n\nAfter Dolby released \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" in 1982, Dolby Laboratories expressed concern regarding the stage name. Dolby's record label refused to make him change his name, and Dolby Labs did not raise the issue again until later. After a lengthy legal battle, the court decided that Dolby Labs had no right to restrict the musician from using the name. It was agreed that he would not release any electronic equipment using the name.<ref name=\"Michael Davis 2008, p. 38\">{{cite book | editor-first= Ernie | editor-last = Rideout | title=Keyboard Presents The Best of The '80s|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2008|page=38}}</ref> [[Tom Dolby|Thomas Dolby]], the son of the Dolby Laboratories founder [[Ray Dolby]], is a novelist and filmmaker.<ref name=\"fruit\"/>\n\n==Solo music career==\nDolby is associated with the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the early 1980s, a form of pop music incorporating [[electronic instrument]]s, but Dolby's work covers a wide range of [[musical style]]s and moods distinct from the high-energy pop sound of his few, better-known commercial successes.<ref name=\"fruit\"/>\n\n===''The Golden Age of Wireless''===\nOriginally released in the UK and US including the songs \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]],\" \"Airwaves,\" and \"Radio Silence,\" the first releases of Dolby's first solo album, ''[[The Golden Age of Wireless]]'' (Harvest, 1982) did not include the album's signature hit, \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]].\" After the five-song EP ''[[Blinded by Science]]'' introduced the catchy single, ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' was re-released with the single that, combined with its accompanying video, became Dolby's most commercially successful single, reaching No.&nbsp;5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Raggett |first=Ned |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-golden-age-of-wireless-mw0000189796 |title=The Golden Age of Wireless \u2013 Thomas Dolby : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> The album was released a total of five times, each with changes in song order and included songs, or even including a different version of \"Radio Silence\" or extended remix of \"She Blinded Me with Science.\"<ref name=\"fruit\"/>\n\n''The Golden Age of Wireless'' reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' album chart]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-golden-age-of-wireless-mw0000189796/awards |title=The Golden Age of Wireless \u2013 Thomas Dolby : Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> It juxtaposed themes of radio technology, aircraft, and naval submarines with those of relationships and nostalgia.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stannard |first=Joseph |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137962-thomas-dolby--reflections-on-the-golden-age-of-wireless-and-the-flat-earth |title=Thomas Dolby: reflections on The Golden Age of Wireless and The Flat Earth / In Depth |website=Drowned in Sound |date=28 September 2009 |access-date=5 February 2013 |archive-date=15 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215065235/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137962-thomas-dolby--reflections-on-the-golden-age-of-wireless-and-the-flat-earth |url-status=dead }}</ref> While much of the album's instrumentation is synthesisers and samplers, the album credits a long list of guest musicians as well, with instruments ranging from harmonica and violin to guitar and percussion.<ref name=\"fruit\"/>\n\n===Dolby's Cube===\nBeginning in 1983, Dolby collaborated with a number of artists in an occasional studio-bound project called Dolby's Cube. The project had no set line-up, and was essentially a forum for Dolby to release material that was more dance-oriented. Dolby's Cube released a single in 1983 (\"Get Out of My Mix\"), another in 1985 (\"May the Cube Be with You\"), and performed soundtrack work for the film ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'' in 1986. Collaborators in Dolby's Cube at various junctures included [[Lene Lovich]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Francois Kevorkian]], and [[Lea Thompson]].\n\n===''The Flat Earth''===\nIn 1984, Dolby released his second LP, ''[[The Flat Earth]]'' (Capitol), which peaked at No.&nbsp;14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and at No.&nbsp;35 on the ''Billboard'' album chart in the US.

The album also included a cover of the [[Dan Hicks (singer)|Dan Hicks]] song \"I Scare Myself.\"\n\n\"Hyperactive!\"<ref name=\"fruit\"/> was the first and most successful single from the album, peaking at No.&nbsp;17 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], making it Dolby's highest-charting single in his home country.\n\n===''Aliens Ate My Buick''===\nIn contrast to the overall introverted nature of ''The Flat Earth'', Dolby described his next release, ''[[Aliens Ate My Buick]]'' (1988):\n{{blockquote|I think it's very bold. Some people who've known my stuff from the beginning find it a bit hard to stomach. They think it's a bit brash. It's certainly unsubtle in a lot of ways. It goes for the jugular. There was always a side to the stuff that I did that was very extroverted and wacky. The flip side of the coin was the more atmospheric, moody stuff. There was always room for both of them. But this album, with the exception of maybe one song [\"Budapest by Blimp\"], is all on the extrovert side.<ref name=\"Michael Davis 2008, p. 38\"/>}}\n\n''Aliens Ate My Buick'' was strongly funk and dance influenced. The first single was \"Airhead\", a satirical song about a stereotypical young-and-rich Californian woman, which peaked at No.&nbsp;53. The second single, \"Hot Sauce\", a [[cover version]] of a [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] song, peaked at No.&nbsp;80. Another single, \"My Brain Is Like A Sieve,\" peaked at No.&nbsp;89 on the UK Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/aliens-ate-my-buick-mw0000196285 |title=Aliens Ate My Buick \u2013 Thomas Dolby : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> The album was co-produced by [[Bill Bottrell]], and featured Terry Jackson on bass guitar.\n\n===''Astronauts and Heretics''===\nFor ''[[Astronauts & Heretics]]'' (Virgin UK), Dolby expanded even further stylistically, starting the songwriting process at the piano, then again collaborating with a variety of guest musicians. Both [[Bob Weir]] and [[Jerry Garcia]] played guitar on \"The Beauty of a Dream\". [[Eddie Van Halen]] plays on \"Eastern Bloc\" and \"Close but No Cigar.\" Other collaborators included [[Jimmy Z]] on sax, [[Budgie (drummer)|Budgie]] on drums and [[Leland Sklar]] on bass guitar. Terry Jackson also contributed bass guitar on four songs before his 1991 death in a plane accident with seven other members of [[Reba McEntire]]'s support band for her \"For My Broken Heart\" tour. <!-- The Funk/Guaracha rhythm guitar on \"That's Why People Fall in Love\" was delivered by Acid Latin creator Thomas Guzman-Sanchez of Rhythm Tribe (VRL MUZIC) -->\n\nThe highest-charting song off this album was \"Close but No Cigar,\" which reached No.&nbsp;22 on the UK charts. Two other songs on the album, \"I Love You Goodbye,\" and \"Silk Pyjamas\" employed [[Zydeco]] influences, courtesy of [[Crowley, Louisiana]] and guest musicians [[Michael Doucet]] of [[BeauSoleil]] on violin, [[Wayne Toups]] on accordion, and Al Tharp on banjo. Even though some recording for the album was done in remote locations, the bulk of ''Astronauts & Heretics'' was recorded at [[NRG Recording Studios]] with input from trusted Dolby co-producer Bill Bottrell, and mixed down at Smoke Tree Studios in [[Chatsworth, California]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''The Sole Inhabitant''===\n[[File:Thomas Dolby.jpg|right|thumbnail|upright|Dolby performing in 2006]]\nFollowing his involvement in [[Beatnik (company)|Beatnik]], Dolby returned to his musical career in 2006. He performed his first solo public show in 15 years at the Red Devil Lounge in San Francisco, California, on 21 January 2006, surprising the crowd who were there to see local band Notorious. He then launched an American tour, the Sole Inhabitant Tour, on 12 April, comprising a string of small dates in California, a science education benefit in [[Boulder, Colorado]], and gigs across America before receptive crowds.\n\nThe United States leg of the \"Sole Inhabitant Tour 2006\" was captured on a \"live\" CD and DVD. The CD represents a recording of two gigs played by Dolby at Martyrs in Chicago, while the DVD was filmed at the Berklee Performance Center at [[Berklee College of Music]]. The DVD also includes a 30-minute interview and a lecture by Dolby at the college. Both the CD and DVD were released in November 2006. Dolby autographed and numbered the first 1,000 copies of the CD and DVD.\n\nA show at the 800 capacity [[Scala (club)|Scala]] club in London was booked for 3 July 2006 as a warm-up for Dolby's Hyde Park set opening for [[Depeche Mode]]. The show sold out in a matter of days and prompted Dolby to reprioritise the UK, resulting in him moving with his family from California back to England, and a nine-date Sole Inhabitant tour of the UK in October 2007, coinciding with the release of a lavish box set of the Sole Inhabitant CD and DVD by UK independent label [[Invisible Hands Music]].\n\nThomas toured throughout the months of November and December 2006 with electronic musician [[Brian Transeau|BT]]. This tour included a version of \"Airwaves\" that BT added his own technique to, which was the opening song on the UK leg of the Sole Inhabitant tour (''sans'' BT).\n\nThomas Dolby's performance of 15 March 2007 at the [[SxSW]] festival<ref>Zahlaway, Jon. [https://archive.today/20071024164332/http://www.livedaily.com/news/11743.html SXSW Review: Thomas Dolby at Elysium], [[LiveDaily]] 15 March 2007. Retrieved 5 May 2009</ref> was released as the live EP ''Thomas Dolby & The Jazz Mafia Horns, Live at SxSW'' (with musicians from San Francisco's [[Jazz Mafia]] collective).\n\nThe 2007 UK Sole Inhabitant tour included three new songs previously played on the US tour, one called \"Your Karma Hit My Dogma\" another called \"Jealous Thing\" and a cover version of [[the Special AKA]]'s \"What I Like Most About You Is Your Girlfriend.\" \"Your Karma Hit My Dogma\" was inspired by [[Kevin Federline]]'s unauthorised use of a sample from [[Mobb Deep]]'s \"[[Got It Twisted]],\" which in turn had used an authorised sample of \"She Blinded Me with Science.\" The tag line from that story became the title of the song. The wording was lifted by Thomas from a bumper sticker on a car that he saw whilst living in the San Francisco Bay area. In a move close to performance art, Dolby tried to post a 'cease and desist' legal letter on Kevin Federline's MySpace page when other attempts to contact him proved fruitless.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1527947/20060405/federline_kevin.jhtml |title=Thomas Dolby Won't Turn Blind Eye To Kevin Federline Sample \u2013 Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=5 April 2006 |access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Jeff Stratton |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2006-12-14/music/before-and-after-science |title=Before and After Science \u2013 Page 1 \u2013 Music \u2013 Miami |newspaper=Miami New Times |date=14 December 2006 |access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> The song is on the ''Live at SxSW'' EP.\n\nThe second new song, \"Jealous Thing\" was performed at least at The Graduate in Cambridge and London's Islington Academy on the UK tour in Summer 2007 and features a Bossa-Nova type rhythm.\n\n===2009 reissues===\nA CD + DVD set entitled ''The Singular Thomas Dolby'' was released by [[EMI]] on 18 May 2009. As the name suggests it is a digitally remastered compilation of previously released singles. The DVD contains all the video singles which were available on the original VHS/BETA/LASERDISC release of ''The Golden Age of Video'', as well as the videos for the songs \"Silk Pyjamas\", \"I Love You Goodbye\", and \"Close but No Cigar\". These three missing videos are for the singles taken from the 1992 album ''Astronauts & Heretics'', which received critical acclaim but garnered unimpressive sales.\n\n''The Golden Age of Wireless'' and ''The Flat Earth'' were reissued and remastered later that year with numerous previously unreleased bonus tracks. The former was a two disc set including a DVD of the complete \"Live Wireless\" video.\n\n===''A Map of the Floating City''===\nIn 2010 Dolby began work on a new studio album entitled ''[[A Map of the Floating City]]''.<ref name=pluginMay2010>{{cite web|url=http://www.pluginmusic.com/news/article/thomas-dolby-prepares-first-new-album-in-20-years|title=Thomas Dolby Prepares First New Album in 20 Years|date=9 May 2010|website=Pluginmusic.com}}</ref> The album is divided into three parts, with the first two parts initially made available to members of The Flat Earth Community Forum, Dolby's online community.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.thomasdolby.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/motfcpress.html|title = Thomas Dolby \u2013 Press Release|date = 28 November 2010|publisher = thomasdolby.com}}</ref> Each of the three digital EPs takes its name from one of the three sections of the full-length album that later followed. The first EP, ''Amerikana'', was released digitally on 16 June 2010. The second EP is entitled ''Oceanea'', and was released on 29 November 2010. Due to favourable reviews and radio airplay, ''Oceanea'' was released commercially on 28 March 2011. The third section of the album, entitled ''Urbanoia'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/emted-solar-power-windpow_b_769720.html |author= Mike Ragogna|title= TED, Solar Power, Windpower, and All Things Amerikana: A Conversation with Thomas Dolby|website=Huffingpost.com|date= 20 October 2010|access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> was not released as a download or physical CD, but the songs were premiered online as part of the Floating City game (see below).\n\nContributors to the album include [[Kevin Armstrong (guitarist)|Kevin Armstrong]], [[Matthew Seligman]] (both had played together with him on ''The Flat Earth'' and as part of David Bowie's [[Live Aid]] appearance), [[Bruce Woolley]], drummer [[Liam Genockey]], guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]] of Dire Straits, [[Regina Spektor]], [[Natalie MacMaster]], [[Eddi Reader]] and [[Imogen Heap]].\n\nIn a 2010 press release he was quoted as saying:\n{{Blockquote|I marvel at the new landscape of the music business&nbsp;\u2013 distribution via the Internet and recording technologies I barely dreamed of when I started out,\" he continues. \"But this album does not sound electronic at all. I have zero desire to add to the myriad of machine-based, synth-driven grooves out there.

What I do best is write songs, tell stories.\"\n\n\"The new songs are organic and very personal. This album is a travelogue across three imaginary continents.

I'm not a city person. And in Oceanea I return to my natural home on the windswept coastline.<ref name=pluginMay2010/>|sign=|source=}}\n\n''A Map of the Floating City'' was recorded in the \"Nutmeg of Consolation\", Dolby's recording studio built within a 1930s lifeboat and powered entirely by renewable energy, which is located in the garden of Dolby's beach house on England's North Sea coast.<ref name=pluginMay2010/>\n\n===Map of the Floating City game===\nIn June 2011 Dolby announced the ''Map of the Floating City'' game, a multiplayer online game that shares a title with the full-length album release planned to follow after the game's conclusion. In Dolby's own words, \"The Floating City is set against a dystopian vision of the 1940s that might have existed had WWII turned out a lot differently.\" Survivors explore a fictional Google map, forming tribes and trading relics amidst a bizarre sea-going barter society. As they struggle to unravel the enigma that is The Floating City, players can haggle over merchandise and music downloads, including brand new songs from ''A Map of the Floating City'', Dolby's first album in 20 years, scheduled to be released following the climax of the game. The game was played from June through August 2011, and included elements of trading, mystery, competition, and co-operation. Players earned free song downloads, and the winning team or \"tribe\" was awarded a private performance from Dolby.\n\n==Session and production work ==\nEarly in his career, Dolby played keyboards with [[Bruce Woolley]] and the Camera Club and is credited on their debut album. The instrumental track \"WW9\" in the album ''[[English_Garden_(album)|English Garden]]'' is the first recorded example of Thomas' writing. He also wrote [[Lene Lovich]]'s hit single \"New Toy\" and played keyboard as part of the backing band for her tour.<ref>\"Thomas Dolby, Intition And Motion\", Freff, musician, May 1984, p. 45</ref> Dolby played some synthesizer parts on the [[Thompson Twins]] album ''[[Set (Thompson Twins album)|Set]]'' and co-wrote \"Magic's Wand\" with [[Whodini]], and played keyboards on one track (\"Love\") on [[Robyn Hitchcock]]'s first solo album, 1981's ''[[Black Snake Diamond Role]]''. Dolby played synthesizer on two tracks on the album [[Pleasure (Girls at Our Best! album)|''Pleasure'']] by the band [[Girls at Our Best!]] Around this time, he also formed a short-lived band called [[the Fallout Club]].\n\nBy far the most significant session relationship for Thomas in the early days was when he contributed the signature synthesizer sound on the track \"[[Urgent (song)|Urgent]]\" on [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s 1981 album ''[[4 (Foreigner album)|4]]''. On the same album he played the atmospheric synthesizer intro to the mega-hit \"[[Waiting for a Girl Like You]].\" The fees from this work, including tour dates, bankrolled the studio time for the recording of the 1980s benchmark album ''[[The Golden Age of Wireless]]'' from which his solo career began.\n\nIn October 1981 Dolby made an appearance in the video for the [[Dave Stewart (keyboardist)|Dave Stewart]] and [[Barbara Gaskin]] British number one cover of \"It's My Party,\" playing the part of Johnny in the \"Judy and Johnny just walked through the door\" section of the song. The video made its first [[Top of the Pops]] appearance on 29 October 1981.\n\nDolby also worked as session keyboard player on [[Def Leppard]]'s 1983 ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' album.

Dolby took this film on the road through the US and UK in the Autumn of 2013, accompanying the film with live music, narration, and sound effects by [[Blake Leyh]]. The film won the DIY Film Festival award for Best Picture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diyconvention.com/?_nozc_=1|title=Diyconvention.com|website=Diyconvention.com|access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Headspace and Beatnik==\n{{Main|Beatnik (company)}}\nIn 1993, Dolby established the [[Beatnik (company)|Headspace]] company. This was intended to provide tools for interactive audio, as at the time Dolby was frustrated about the lack of interactive audio tools. During this period, Dolby worked on a number of video game soundtracks through his company. The company was later approached to create MIDI-based music for [[WebTV]], leading to Dolby composing several key music tracks that were bundled with the devices.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the company Igor's Software Laboratories in 1996, which was also involved with creating audio for WebTV, Headspace developed a new downloadable file format designed specifically for Internet usage called Rich Music Format with the [[Rich Music Format|RMF]] file extension.<ref>Bruce Orwall, \"Sound On; Thomas Dolby Robertson Has A Complaint About The Web: It's Too Quiet\", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 1997</ref> It had the advantage of small file size like [[MIDI]] but allowed recorded sampled sounds to be included at a higher bitrate for better overall reproduction. RMF music files could be played in a browser using the free Beatnik Player plug-in, and were also encrypted to prevent unauthorised duplication, while info such as the composer and copyright information could also be embedded within the files. In 1999, Headspace, Inc. was renamed Beatnik, Inc., and later shifted its focus towards software synthesizers for [[mobile phones]], which it licensed to mobile phone manufacturers including [[Nokia]]. As [[truetone]] ringtones eventually overtook polyphonic ringtones in popularity, Beatnik went defunct in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=25461|title=Beatnik, Inc.: Private Company Information \u2013 Businessweek|website=[[Bloomberg News]] |access-date=24 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nDolby stepped down from his position as CEO in 2002, feeling that the business was no longer interesting to him, although he remained on the board. This subsequently led to him founding Retro Ringtones LLC, which produced the RetroFolio ringtone asset management software suite for companies involved in the mobile phone ringtone business, as well as offering ringtones that could be purchased by businesses. These ringtones largely consisted of sound clips such as animal sounds, celebrity quotes and sci-fi sound effects, as well as polyphonic covers of popular theme songs. At the second annual Mobile Music Awards, Miami, Florida, in 2004 RetroFolio won \"Best of Show\" and \"Best New Technology\" awards.<ref name=\"fruit\"/> The company ended business in 2005 and has since been suspended by [[Secretary of State of California]].\n\nDolby created hundreds of [[Digital data|digital]] polyphonic ringtones on mobile phones, both at Beatnik and Retro Ringtones. He was often a speaker at technology conferences such as [[Comdex]], [[Websphere]], and Nokia.<ref name=\"fruit\"/>\n\n==Other endeavours==\n===1985 Grammy Awards and Live Aid===\nIn 1985, Dolby appeared at the [[Grammy Award]]s, which were televised, along with [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]]. All four musicians were successful in the mid-1980s music scene, and they were also all keyboard and synthesizer experts. That same year, Dolby performed at the [[Live Aid]] concert in London as part of [[David Bowie]]'s band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/entertainment/live-aid-concerts-30th-anniversary-thomas-dolby/index.html|title=Thomas Dolby: I feared I'd 'screw up' Live Aid|date=10 July 2015|publisher=CNN|access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Virtual reality===\nDolby's first experiment with [[virtual reality]] took place in the fall of 1992, when he was invited by the [[Guggenheim Museum in New York|Guggenheim Museum]], New York<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peabody.jhu.edu/faculty/thomas-dolby/|title=Thomas Dolby |publisher=Peabody Institute}}</ref> to design and install a sonic VR experience. This led to The Virtual String Quartet programmed by Eric Gullichsen, and sponsored by [[Intel]] Corp. The experience ran on an IBM 386 processor with a Convolvatron 4-channel audio card. Users wore a head-mounted display and found themselves in the midst of a [[computer-generated holography|computer-generated]] [[string quartet]] playing [[Mozart]]. The sound was fully spatialized as the user moved around the physical space. Tickling a player with the joystick resulted in that musician switching to improvisation in a '[[Dixieland|hot jazz]]' or Appalachian bluegrass style.\n\nIn the Fall of 2018, Dolby created a New Media workshop at The Peabody Institute of [[Johns Hopkins University]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peabody.jhu.edu/academics/instruments-areas-of-study/music-for-new-media/|title=Music for New Media |publisher=Peabody Institute}}</ref> with VR equipment donated by HTC Vive. Students in his course are learning to compose music for VR and AR.\n\nOn 4 October 2018 Dolby performed a live score for the High Fidelity VR event 'Escape from Zombie Island.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tockify.com/hifieventscalendar/detail/353/1538697600000|title=Escape Zombie Island: A Pop-Up VR Arcade|website=Tockify.com}}</ref> He appeared 'in-world' as his own avatar, where he triggered and played real-time horror film music.

He provided live musical introductions to sessions, sometimes with a TED house band, and helped secure guest musicians and entertainers. Onstage, he played with singers and performers such as Eddi Reader, Natalie MacMaster, Rachelle Garniez and [[David Byrne]], and premiered his own song \"Love Is a Loaded Pistol\" onstage at TEDGlobal 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dolby |first1=Thomas |title=\"Love Is a Loaded Pistol\" premiere |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/pistol |publisher=TED (conference)}}</ref> He stood down from the position in September 2012<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dolby |first1=Thomas |title=Thomas Dolby retires as musical director of TED Conferences |url=https://blog.ted.com/thomas-dolby-retires-as-musical-director-of-ted-conferences/ |website=TED Blog|date=19 September 2012 }}</ref> to pursue music.\n\nIn March 2012, Dolby spoke at the DESIGN West conference in San Jose, California at the McEnery Convention Center, produced by UBM Electronics.<ref>{{cite web|title=DESIGN West Keynotes|url=http://www.ubmdesign.com/conference/keynotes|publisher=UBM Electronics|access-date=5 February 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126181331/http://www.ubmdesign.com/conference/keynotes|archive-date=26 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Academic career===\nIn March 2014, Dolby was named Homewood Professor of the Arts at [[Baltimore]]'s [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2014/03/06/she-blinded-me-with-science-singer-thomas-dolby-to-be-hopkins-professor/ |title=She Blinded Me With Science' singer Thomas Dolby to be Hopkins professor |date=6 March 2014 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> In March 2017, the [[Peabody Institute]] announced that Dolby would lead a new four-year undergraduate degree program, ''Music for New Media'', and the first cohort would commence in the fall of 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hub.jhu.edu/2017/03/16/thomas-dolby-new-music-program-peabody/ |title=Thomas Dolby to lead Music for New Media program at Peabody Institute |date=16 March 2017 |work=Hub (Johns Hopkins University)}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nDolby said he became interested in electronic music because \"I'm not a very proficient keyboard player, so the computer became my musical instrument ...
