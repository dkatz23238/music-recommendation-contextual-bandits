See WP:ENGVAR. --> an English [[electronic music]] band formed in [[Basildon]], [[Essex]], in 1980. The band currently consists of [[Dave Gahan]] (lead vocals and co-songwriting) and [[Martin Gore]] (keyboards, guitar, co-lead vocals and main songwriting).\n\nDepeche Mode was formed by the lineup of Gahan, Gore, [[Andy Fletcher (musician)|Andy Fletcher]], and [[Vince Clarke]], and released their debut album ''[[Speak & Spell (album)|Speak & Spell]]'' in 1981, bringing the band onto the British [[new wave music|new wave]] scene. After founding member Clarke left following the release of the album, they recorded ''[[A Broken Frame]]'' as a trio. Gore took over as main songwriter and later, in 1982, [[Alan Wilder]] replaced Clarke, establishing a lineup that continued for 13 years. The band's last albums of the 1980s, ''[[Black Celebration]]'' and ''[[Music for the Masses]]'', established them as a dominant force within the electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's June 1988 concert at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Pasadena Rose Bowl]], where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In early 1990, they released ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]'', an international mainstream success. The following album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'', released in 1993, was also a success, though the band's internal struggles during recording and touring resulted in Wilder's departure in 1995. The band continued with the trio lineup of Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher until Fletcher's death in 2022.\n\nDepeche Mode have had 54 songs in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and 17 Top 10 albums in the UK chart; they have sold more than 100 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|title= Depeche Mode mit Weltpremiere beim ECHO |publisher= [[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] |date= 3 February 2009 |access-date= 18 August 2014 |url= http://www.musikindustrie.de/presse_aktuell_einzel/back/82/page/3/news/depeche-mode-mit-weltpremiere-beim-echo/ |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082648/http://www.musikindustrie.de/presse_aktuell_einzel/back/82/page/3/news/depeche-mode-mit-weltpremiere-beim-echo/ |archive-date= 19 August 2014 |language= de}}</ref><ref name=\"Mason\">{{cite magazine|first= Kerri |last= Mason |title= Depeche Mode Prepares for Tour of the Universe |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 23 March 2009 |access-date= 5 November 2014 |url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269153/depeche-mode-prepares-for-tour-of-the-universe}}</ref> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' included the band in its list of the \"50 Bands That Changed the World!\"<ref name=\"50Bands\">{{cite magazine|title= Q \u2013 50 Bands That Changed the World! |magazine= Q |via= Rocklist.net |issue= 214 |date= May 2004 |access-date= 31 March 2012 |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm#50%20Bands%20That%20Changed%20The%20World}}</ref> Depeche Mode also rank No. 98 on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Brandon |last= Stosuy |title= VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All Time |website= [[Stereogum]] |date= 13 April 2011 |access-date= 26 September 2015 |url= https://www.stereogum.com/495331/vh1-100-greatest-artists-of-all-time/franchises/list/attachment/depeche-mode/}}</ref> In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named Depeche Mode the 10th Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= 29 September 2017 |url= https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists}}</ref> They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2017 and 2018, and were inducted as part of the Class of 2020.<ref name=\"Class\">{{cite news|title= Class of 2020 |publisher= [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |url= https://www.rockhall.com/class-2020-inductees |access-date= 15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''Speak & Spell'' (1977\u20131981)===\n{{See also|Speak & Spell (album)}}\n[[File:Depeche-mode-martin-gore2.jpg|alt=Martin Gore in 1986|thumb|Martin Gore in 1986]]\nDepeche Mode's origins date to 1977, when schoolmates Vince Clarke and Andy Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass guitar.

They lent their support to high-profile charities such as [[MusiCares]], [[Cancer Research UK]] and the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]]. The band has also supported the [[Small Steps Project]], a humanitarian organization based in the United Kingdom, aiming to assist economically disadvantaged children into education.<ref>{{cite web|title= Depeche Mode: Charity Work, Events and Causes |website= Look to the Stars |access-date= 25 March 2017 |url= https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/depeche-mode}}</ref> They have partnered with Swiss watchmaker [[Hublot]] to support [[Charity: Water]], aimed at the provision of clean drinking water in developing countries.<ref>{{cite web|first= Joelle |last= Diderich |title= Hublot and Depeche Mode Link Up to Benefit Charity: Water |website= WWD |date= 30 January 2014 |access-date= 25 March 2017 |url= http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/hublot-and-depeche-mode-link-up-to-benefit-charity-water-7402778/}}</ref> Such collaboration led to the release of two different limited edition watches, the Hublot Big Bang Depeche Mode in 2017 and The Singles Limited Edition series based from the Big Bang model in 2018.
