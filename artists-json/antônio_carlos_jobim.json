Considered one of the great exponents of Brazilian music, Jobim internationalized [[bossa nova]] and, with the help of important American artists, merged it with jazz in the 1960s to create a new sound, with popular success. As such, he is sometimes known as the \"father of bossa nova\".<ref name=Euronews-2014-12-10>{{cite news |url= https://www.euronews.com/2014/12/10/rio-unveils-statue-of-father-of-bossa-nova-tom-jobim |title= Rio unveils statue of father of bossa nova Tom Jobim |date= 10 December 2014 |publisher= Euronews }}</ref>\n\nJobim was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style, and his songs have been performed by many singers and instrumentalists internationally.\n\nIn 1965, the album ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'' was the first jazz record to win the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].

His father, Jorge de Oliveira Jobim ([[S\u00e3o Gabriel, Rio Grande do Sul|S\u00e3o Gabriel]], Rio Grande do Sul; 1889\u20131935), was a writer, diplomat, professor and journalist.

In 1935, when the elder Jobim died, Nilza married Celso da Frota Pessoa (died 2 February 1979), who would encourage his stepson's career. He was the one who gave Jobim his first piano. As a young man of limited means, Jobim earned his living by playing in nightclubs and bars and later as an arranger for a recording label before starting to achieve success as a composer.\n\n=== Musical influences ===\nJobim's musical roots were planted firmly in the work of [[Pixinguinha]], the legendary musician and composer who began modern Brazilian music in the 1930s. Among his teachers were L\u00facia Branco and, from 1941 on, [[Hans-Joachim Koellreutter]], a German composer who lived in Brazil and introduced atonal and twelve-tone composition in the country. Jobim was also influenced by the French composers [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]], and by the Brazilian composers [[Ary Barroso]] and [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], who has been described as Jobim's \"most important musical influence.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ewans|first1=Michael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKjNSbEOUKkC&q=jobim+villa+lobos&pg=PA264|title=Music Research: New Directions for a New Century|last2=Halton|first2=Rosalind|last3=Phillips|first3=John A.|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Press|isbn=978-1-904303-35-0|language=en}}</ref> Among many themes, his lyrics talked about love, self-discovery, betrayal, joy and especially about the birds and natural wonders of Brazil, like the \"Mata Atl\u00e2ntica\" forest, characters of Brazilian folklore and his home city of [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n==Career==\nIn the 1940s, Jobim started to play piano in bars and nightclubs of Rio de Janeiro, and in the first years of the 1950s, he worked as an arranger in the Continental Studio, where he had his first composition recorded, in April 1953, when the Brazilian singer Mauricy Moura recorded ''Incerteza'', a composition by Tom Jobim with lyrics by Newton Mendon\u00e7a.<ref>{{Citation|last=B\u00e9hague|first=Gerard|chapter=Jobim, Ant\u00f4nio Carlos [Tom]|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.44182|title=Oxford Music Online|isbn=9781561592630 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jobim.org/jobim/handle/2010/4827|title=Incerteza|website=Jobim Institute}}</ref>\n\nJobim became prominent in Brazil when he teamed up with poet and diplomat [[Vinicius de Moraes]] to write the music for the play ''[[Orfeu da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o]]'' (1956). The most popular song from the show was \"Se Todos Fossem Iguais A Voc\u00ea\" (\"If Everyone Were Like You\"). Later, when the play was adapted into a film, producer [[:fr:Sacha Gordine|Sacha Gordine]] did not want to use any of the existing music from the play. Gordine asked de Moraes and Jobim for a new score for the film ''Orfeu Negro'', or ''[[Black Orpheus]]'' (1959). Moraes was at the time away in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, working for the Itamaraty (the [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]) and so he and Jobim were only able to write three songs, primarily over the telephone (\"''[[A felicidade]]''\", \"''Frevo''\" and \"''O nosso amor''\"). This collaboration proved successful, and de Moraes went on to pen the lyrics to some of Jobim's most popular songs.\n\nIn 1958 the Brazilian singer and guitarist [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]] recorded his first album with two of the most famous songs of Tom Jobim: ''Desafinado'' and ''Chega de Saudade''. This album inaugurates the Bossa Nova movement in Brazil. The sophisticated harmonies of his songs caught the attention of jazz musicians in the United States, principally after the first performance of Tom Jobim at [[Carnegie Hall]], in 1962.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portal.jobim.org/jobim/cronologia|title=Tom Jobim|website=portal.jobim.org|access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Tom Jobim, 1972.tif|thumb|Jobim in 1972]]\nA key event in making Jobim's music known in the English-speaking world was his collaboration with the American jazz saxophonist [[Stan Getz]], the Brazilian singer [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], and Gilberto's wife at the time, [[Astrud Gilberto]], which resulted in two albums, ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'' (1963) and ''[[Getz/Gilberto Vol. 2]]'' (1964). The release of ''Getz/Gilberto'' created a bossa nova craze in the United States and subsequently internationally. Getz had previously recorded ''[[Jazz Samba]]'' with Charlie Byrd (1962), and ''[[Jazz Samba Encore!]]'' with [[Luiz Bonf\u00e1]] (1964). Jobim wrote many of the songs on ''Getz/Gilberto'', which became one of the best-selling [[jazz]] albums of all time, and turned Astrud Gilberto, who sang on \"''Garota de Ipanema''\" ([[The Girl from Ipanema]]) and \"[[Corcovado (song)|''Corcovado'']]\" (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars), into an international sensation. At the [[Grammy Awards of 1965]] ''Getz/Gilberto'' won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], the [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group]] and the [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]]. \"The Girl from Ipanema\" won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]]. Among his later hits is \"''\u00c1guas de Mar\u00e7o''\" ([[Waters of March]], 1972), for which he wrote both the Portuguese and English lyrics, and which was then translated into French by [[Georges Moustaki]] (Les Eaux de Mars, 1973).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Les eaux de mars - BnF Data|url=https://data.bnf.fr/fr/14730703/antonio_carlos_jobim_les_eaux_de_mars/|access-date=2 November 2020|website=[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]|year=1972}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nJobim was married to Thereza Otero Hermanny on 15 October 1949 and had two children with her: Paulo Jobim (born 1950), an architect and musician, (father of [[:pt: Daniel Jobim|Daniel Jobim]] (born 1973) and Dora Jobim (born 1976)); and Elizabeth \"Beth\" Jobim (born 1957), a painter.

Many of his songs are [[jazz standards]]. American jazz singers [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] prominently featured Jobim's songs on their albums ''[[Ella Abra\u00e7a Jobim]]'' (1981) and ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]]'' (1967), respectively. The 1996 CD ''Wave: The Antonio Carlos Jobim Songbook'' included performances of Jobim tunes by [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chick Corea]] and [[Toots Thielemans]].\n\nJobim was an innovator in the use of sophisticated harmonic structures in popular song. Some of his melodic twists, like the melody insisting on the major seventh of the chord, became commonplace in jazz after he used them.<ref>[[Jo\u00e3o MacDowell|MacDowell, Jo\u00e3o]]; The Harmonic Development of Brazilian Song, Rio de Janeiro,1999.</ref>\n\nThe Brazilian collaborators and interpreters of Jobim's music include [[Vinicius de Moraes]], [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]] (often credited as a co-creator or creator of bossa nova), [[Chico Buarque]], [[Edu Lobo]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Elis Regina]], [[S\u00e9rgio Mendes]], [[Astrud Gilberto]] and [[Flora Purim]].
