The band formed in 2002 and was active until 2008, when Weiland left the band abruptly to rejoin Stone Temple Pilots.\n\nIn 2004, the band achieved commercial success with their debut album, ''[[Contraband (Velvet Revolver album)|Contraband]]''. Despite positive reviews, some critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses, and criticizing them for a \"disconnection\" between Weiland and the rest of the band. With their single \"[[Slither (song)|Slither]]\", they won the 2005 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]. The band released ''[[Libertad (Velvet Revolver album)|Libertad]]'' in 2007, driven by the release of the single \"[[She Builds Quick Machines]]\", and embarked on a tour with [[Alice in Chains]].\n\nIn April 2008, Weiland abruptly left Velvet Revolver and [[2008 Stone Temple Pilots Reunion Tour|reunited with Stone Temple Pilots]]. Velvet Revolver was put on indefinite hiatus and in November of that year, requested to be released by their record label [[RCA Records]] to allow themselves \"complete freedom to go through whatever process it would take to accomplish\" replacing Weiland.\n\nAlthough Velvet Revolver worked on new material and auditioned new singers following Scott Weiland's departure, the band has not released any new material and only performed publicly once since 2008, when they reunited with Weiland for a one-off reunion show on January 12, 2012, at a benefit concert. This proved to be their last performance together before Weiland's death on December 3, 2015. Slash and McKagan later rejoined Guns N' Roses in 2016.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundations (2001\u20132002)===\nSlash, Duff McKagan, and Matt Sorum were members of the hard rock band [[Guns N' Roses]]. However, disagreements with singer [[Axl Rose]] resulted in Slash leaving the band in 1996 and McKagan departing in 1997 shortly before Sorum was fired.<ref name=\"Guns N' Roses AMG\">{{cite web | author = Thomas Erlewine, Stephen |author2=Prato, Greg | title = Guns N' Roses Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = November 14, 2010 | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4416/biography|pure_url=yes}} | author-link = Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> Following their departures the trio focused on separate projects, with Slash reforming [[Slash's Snakepit]]<ref name=\"Slash AMG\">{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | title = Slash Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = November 14, 2010 | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=slash-p125919/biography|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref> and McKagan reforming [[10 Minute Warning]]<ref name=\"Duff McKagan AMG\">{{cite web | last = Torreano | first = Bradley | title = Duff McKagan Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = November 14, 2010 | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p104254/biography|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref><ref name=\"10 Minute Warning AMG\">{{cite web | last = Ankeny | first = Jason | title = 10 Minute Warning Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = November 14, 2010 | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p294177/biography|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref> as well as recording his second solo album,<ref name=\"Duff McKagan AMG\"/> while Sorum rejoined [[the Cult]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Slash | author2 = Bozza, Anthony | author-link2 = Anthony Bozza | title = [[Slash (autobiography)|Slash]] | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2007 | page = [https://archive.org/details/slashautobiograp0000unse/page/397 397] | isbn = 978-0-00-725775-1 }}</ref>\n\nBy 2001, Slash's Snakepit had disbanded for the second time.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Slash | author2 = Bozza, Anthony | author-link2 = Anthony Bozza | title = [[Slash (autobiography)|Slash]] | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2007 | page = [https://archive.org/details/slashautobiograp0000unse/page/410 410] | isbn = 978-0-00-725775-1 }}</ref> Slash began working with [[the Black Crowes]] drummer [[Steve Gorman]] and an unnamed bassist on a new project:<ref name=\"VR Ultimate Guitar\">{{cite web | last = Rosen | first = Steven | title = Velvet Revolver: 'We're Straight Up F--kin?
