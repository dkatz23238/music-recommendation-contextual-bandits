He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the [[Post-war jazz|history of jazz]] and 20th-century music.\n\nBorn and raised in [[North Carolina]], Coltrane moved to [[Philadelphia]] after graduating high school, where he studied music. Working in the [[bebop]] and [[hard bop]] idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of [[Modal jazz|modes]] and was one of the players at the forefront of [[free jazz]]. He led at least fifty recording sessions  and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] and pianist [[Thelonious Monk]]. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension, as exemplified on his most acclaimed albums ''[[A Love Supreme]]'' (1965) and ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'' (1966). \n\nDecades after his death, Coltrane remains influential, and he has received numerous posthumous awards, including a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special Pulitzer Prize]], and was [[canonization|canonized]] by the [[African Orthodox Church]].<ref name=pulitzer>{{cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2007-Special-Awards-and-Citations |title=The 2007 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Special Awards and Citations |access-date=June 29, 2009 |publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes}} With reprint of short biography.</ref>\n\nHis second wife was pianist and harpist [[Alice Coltrane]].

He was a member of groups led by [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Earl Bostic]], and [[Johnny Hodges]] in the early to mid-1950s.\n\n===1955\u20131957: Miles and Monk period===\nIn 1955, Coltrane was freelancing in Philadelphia while studying with Sandole when he received a call from trumpeter [[Miles Davis]]. Davis had been successful in the 1940s, but his reputation and work had been damaged in part by [[heroin]] addiction; he was again active and about to form a quintet. Coltrane was with this edition of the Davis band (known as the \"First Great Quintet\"\u2014along with [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums) from October 1955 to April 1957 (with a few absences). During this period Davis released several influential recordings that revealed the first signs of Coltrane's growing ability. This quintet, represented by two marathon recording sessions for [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] in 1956, resulted in the albums ''[[Cookin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Cookin'<nowiki/>]]'', ''[[Relaxin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Relaxin'<nowiki/>]]'', ''[[Workin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Workin']]'', and ''[[Steamin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Steamin']]''. The \"First Great Quintet\" disbanded due in part to Coltrane's heroin addiction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/07/movies/critic-s-notebook-the-miracle-of-coltrane-dead-at-40-still-vital-at-75.html|title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; The Miracle of Coltrane: Dead at 40, Still Vital at 75|first=Ben|last=Ratliff|date=December 7, 2001|access-date=March 29, 2019|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the later part of 1957, Coltrane worked with [[Thelonious Monk]] at New York's [[Five Spot Caf\u00e9]], and played in Monk's quartet (July\u2013December 1957), but, owing to contractual conflicts, took part in only one official studio recording session with this group. Coltrane recorded many sessions for Prestige under his own name at this time, but Monk refused to record for his old label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackthen.com/john-coltrane-legendary-revolutionary-saxophonist-history-jazz-music/|title=John Coltrane: Legendary and Revolutionary Saxophonist in the History of Jazz Music|website=Blackthen.com|date=May 27, 2018|access-date=March 29, 2019}}</ref> A private recording made by Juanita Naima Coltrane of a 1958 reunion of the group was issued by Blue Note Records as ''Live at the Five Spot\u2014Discovery!'' in 1993. A high quality tape of a concert given by this quartet in November 1957 was found later, and was released by Blue Note in 2005. Recorded by [[Voice of America]], the performances confirm the group's reputation, and the resulting album, ''[[Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall]]'', is very highly rated.\n\n''[[Blue Train (album)|Blue Train]]'', Coltrane's sole date as leader for Blue Note, featuring trumpeter [[Lee Morgan]], bassist [[Paul Chambers]], and trombonist [[Curtis Fuller]], is often considered his best album from this period. Four of its five tracks are original Coltrane compositions, and the title track, \"[[Moment's Notice]]\", and \"[[Lazy Bird]]\", have become standards.\n\n===1958: Davis and Coltrane===\nColtrane rejoined Davis in January 1958. In October of that year, jazz critic [[Ira Gitler]] coined the term \"[[sheets of sound]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.allaboutjazz.com/john-coltrane-sheets-of-sound.php|title=Jazz news: John Coltrane: Sheets of Sound|website=News.allaboutjazz.com|date=June 19, 2009|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> to describe the style Coltrane developed with Monk and was perfecting in Davis's group, now a sextet. His playing was compressed, with rapid runs cascading in very many notes per minute. Coltrane recalled: \"I found that there were a certain number of chord progressions to play in a given time, and sometimes what I played didn't work out in eighth notes, sixteenth notes, or triplets. I had to put the notes in uneven groups like fives and sevens in order to get them all in.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coltrane |first1=John |last2=DeMicheal |first2=Don |date=September 29, 1960 |title=Coltrane on Coltrane |journal=[[DownBeat]] |pages=27 }}</ref>\n\nColtrane stayed with Davis until April 1960, working with alto saxophonist [[Cannonball Adderley]]; pianists [[Red Garland]], [[Bill Evans]], and [[Wynton Kelly]]; bassist [[Paul Chambers]]; and drummers [[Philly Joe Jones]] and [[Jimmy Cobb]].

The quintet had a celebrated and extensively recorded residency at the [[Village Vanguard]], which demonstrated Coltrane's new direction. It included the most experimental music he had played, influenced by Indian [[ragas]], [[modal jazz]], and [[free jazz]]. [[John Gilmore (musician)|John Gilmore]], a longtime saxophonist with musician [[Sun Ra]], was particularly influential; after hearing a Gilmore performance, Coltrane is reported to have said, \"He's got it!

Garrett recalled playing a tape for Coltrane where \"I was playing with another bass player. We were doing some things rhythmically, and Coltrane became excited about the sound.

Audiences, too, were perplexed; in France he was booed during his final tour with Davis. In 1961, ''DownBeat'' magazine called Coltrane and Dolphy players of \"anti-jazz\" in an article that bewildered and upset the musicians.<ref name=\"kofsky\" /> Coltrane admitted some of his early solos were based mostly on technical ideas. Furthermore, Dolphy's angular, voice-like playing earned him a reputation as a figurehead of the \"New Thing\", also known as free jazz, a movement led by [[Ornette Coleman]] which was denigrated by some jazz musicians (including Davis) and critics. But as Coltrane's style developed, he was determined to make every performance \"a whole expression of one's being\".<ref>Nisenson, p. 179.</ref>\n\n===1962\u20131965: Classic Quartet period===\n{{Listen|pos = right\n |filename = In a Sentimental Mood sample.ogg\n |title = 'In a Sentimental Mood'\n |description = The romantic ballad features Coltrane with pianist Duke Ellington.\n}}\nIn 1962, Dolphy departed and [[Jimmy Garrison]] replaced Workman as bassist. From then on, the \"Classic Quartet\", as it came to be known, with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones, produced searching, spiritually driven work. Coltrane was moving toward a more harmonically static style that allowed him to expand his improvisations rhythmically, melodically, and motivically. Harmonically complex music was still present, but on stage Coltrane heavily favored continually reworking his \"standards\": \"Impressions\", \"My Favorite Things\", and \"I Want to Talk About You\".\n\nThe criticism of the quintet with Dolphy may have affected Coltrane. In contrast to the radicalism of his 1961 recordings at the Village Vanguard, his studio albums in the following two years (with the exception of ''[[Coltrane (1962 album)|Coltrane]]'', 1962, which featured a blistering version of [[Harold Arlen]]'s \"Out of This World\") were much more conservative. He recorded an album of ballads and participated in album collaborations with [[Duke Ellington and John Coltrane|Duke Ellington]] and singer [[John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman|Johnny Hartman]], a baritone who specialized in ballads. The album ''[[Ballads (John Coltrane album)|Ballads]]'' (recorded 1961\u201362) is emblematic of Coltrane's versatility, as the quartet shed new light on standards such as \"It's Easy to Remember\". Despite a more polished approach in the studio, in concert the quartet continued to balance \"standards\" and its own more exploratory and challenging music, as can be heard on the ''[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]'' (recorded 1961\u201363), ''[[Live at Birdland (1964 John Coltrane album)|Live at Birdland]]'' and ''[[Newport '63]]'' (both recorded 1963). ''Impressions'' consists of two extended jams including the title track along with \"Dear Old Stockholm\", \"After the Rain\" and a blues. Coltrane later said he enjoyed having a \"balanced catalogue\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNZQCgAAQBAJ&q=%22Coltrane+later+said+he+enjoyed+having+a+%22balanced+catalogue.%22%22&pg=PT192|title=The History of Jazz and the Jazz Musicians|date=March 13, 2013|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|access-date=March 29, 2019|via=Google Books|isbn=9781257544486}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 1963, the group entered [[Van Gelder Studio]] in New Jersey and recorded a session that was lost for decades after its master tape was destroyed by Impulse Records to cut down on storage space.

A culmination of much of Coltrane's work up to this point, this four-part suite is an ode to his faith in and love for God. These spiritual concerns characterized much of Coltrane's composing and playing from this point onwards\u2014as can be seen from album titles such as ''Ascension'', ''Om'' and ''Meditations''. The fourth movement of ''A Love Supreme'', \"Psalm\", is, in fact, a musical setting for an original poem to God written by Coltrane, and printed in the album's liner notes. Coltrane plays almost exactly one note for each syllable of the poem, and bases his phrasing on the words. The album was composed at [[John Coltrane Home|Coltrane's home]] in [[Dix Hills, New York|Dix Hills]] on Long Island.\n\nThe quartet played ''A Love Supreme'' live only three times, recorded twice \u2014 in July 1965 at a concert in [[Antibes]], France and in October 1965 in Seattle, Washington.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Lewis |last2=DeVito |first2=Chris |last3=Fujioka |first3=Yasuhiro |last4=Wild |first4=David |last5=Schmaler |first5=Wolf |title=The John Coltrane Reference |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |pages=733\u2013735 }}</ref> A recording of the Antibes concert was released by [[Impulse!

A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like [[multiphonics]], use of overtones, and playing in the [[altissimo]] register, as well as a mutated return of Coltrane's sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned soprano saxophone to concentrate on tenor. The quartet responded by playing with increasing freedom. The group's evolution can be traced through the albums ''[[The John Coltrane Quartet Plays]]'', ''[[Living Space (album)|Living Space]]'', ''[[Transition (John Coltrane album)|Transition]]'', ''[[New Thing at Newport]]'', ''[[Sun Ship]]'', and ''[[First Meditations]]''.\n\nIn June 1965, he went into Van Gelder's studio with ten other musicians (including Shepp,<ref name=\"aceves\">{{cite web|last=Aceves|first=Rusty|title=A Look Back At John Coltrane's Ascension|url=https://www.sfjazz.org/onthecorner/look-back-john-coltranes-ascension|work=[[SFJAZZ Center]]|date=January 27, 2017|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> [[Pharoah Sanders]],<ref name=\"aceves\"/> [[Freddie Hubbard]],<ref name=\"aceves\"/> [[Marion Brown]], and [[John Tchicai]]<ref name=\"aceves\"/>) to record ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'', a 38-minute piece that included solos by young avant-garde musicians.<ref name=\"bray\"/> The album was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos.

Claiming he was unable to hear himself over the two drummers, Tyner left the band shortly after the recording of ''[[Meditations (John Coltrane album)|Meditations]]''.

When touring, the group was known for playing long versions of their repertoire, many stretching beyond 30 minutes to an hour. In concert, solos by band members often extended beyond fifteen minutes.\n\nThe group can be heard on several concert recordings from 1966, including ''[[Live at the Village Vanguard Again!]]'' and ''[[Live in Japan (John Coltrane album)|Live in Japan]]''. In 1967, Coltrane entered the studio several times. Although pieces with Sanders have surfaced (the unusual \"To Be\" has both men on flute), most of the recordings were either with the quartet minus Sanders (''[[Expression (album)|Expression]]'' and ''[[Stellar Regions]]'') or as a duo with Ali. The latter duo produced six performances that appear on the album ''[[Interstellar Space]]''. Coltrane also continued to tour with the second quartet up until two months before his death; his penultimate live performance and final recorded one, a radio broadcast for the Olatunji Center of African Culture in [[New York City]], was eventually released as [[The Olatunji Concert: The Last Live Recording|an album]] in 2001.\n\n===1967: Illness and death===\nColtrane died of [[liver cancer]] at the age of 40 on July 17, 1967, at [[North Shore LIJ Health System#Hospitals|Huntington Hospital]] on Long Island.

In 1956, the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Syeeda moved into an apartment on 103rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue. in New York. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home at 116-60 Mexico Street in [[St. Albans, Queens]].<ref name=\"PorterDeVito2013\">{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Lewis |last2=DeVito |first2=Chris |last3=Wild |first3=David |title=The John Coltrane Reference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvlVu9XCoxUC&pg=PA323|access-date=November 25, 2018 |date=April 26, 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-11257-8 |pages=323\u2013 }}</ref> This is the house where they would break up in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jazzwax.com/2009/06/john-coltrane-naima.html |title=John Coltrane: Naima |website=JazzWax.com|date=June 15, 2009 |access-date=January 16, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121195221/http://www.jazzwax.com/2009/06/john-coltrane-naima.html |archive-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAbout the breakup, Naima said in J. C. Thomas's ''Chasin' the Trane'': \"I could feel it was going to happen sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year.\" But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.\n\n===1957 \"spiritual awakening\"===\nIn 1957, Coltrane had a religious experience that may have helped him overcome the heroin addiction<ref>Porter, p. 61.</ref><ref>Lavezzoli, p. 271.</ref> and alcoholism<ref name=\"Lavezzoli271\">Lavezzoli, p. 271.</ref> he had struggled with since 1948.<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 272\u2013273.</ref> In the liner notes of ''A Love Supreme'', Coltrane states that in 1957 he experienced \"by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.\" The liner notes appear to mention God in a [[Universalism|Universalist]] sense and do not advocate one religion over another.<ref>[http://www.jindustry.com/xtra/coltrane/html/saintjohn.html John Coltrane's liner notes to ''A Love Supreme'', December 1964] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608155911/http://www.jindustry.com/xtra/coltrane/html/saintjohn.html |date=June 8, 2011 }}</ref> Further evidence of this universal view can be found in the liner notes of ''Meditations'' (1965) in which Coltrane declares, \"I believe in all religions.\"<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\">Lavezzoli, p. 286.</ref>\n\n===Second marriage===\nIn 1963, he met pianist [[Alice Coltrane|Alice McLeod]].<ref name=\"Lavezzoli281\">Lavezzoli, p. 281.</ref> He and Alice moved in together and had two sons before he became \"officially divorced from Naima in 1966, at which time [he] and Alice were immediately married.\"<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/> John Jr. was born in 1964, Ravi in 1965, and Oranyan (\"Oran\") in 1967.<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/> According to the musician Peter Lavezzoli, \"Alice brought happiness and stability to John's life, not only because they had children, but also because they shared many of the same spiritual beliefs, particularly a mutual interest in Indian philosophy. Alice also understood what it was like to be a professional musician.\"<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/>\n\n===Spiritual influence in music, religious exploration===\nAfter ''A Love Supreme'', many of the titles of his songs and albums had spiritual connotations: ''Ascension'', ''Meditations'', ''Om'', ''Selflessness'', \"Amen\", \"Ascent\", \"Attaining\", \"Dear Lord\", \"Prayer and Meditation Suite\", and \"The Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost\".<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/> His library of books included ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'', the [[Bhagavad Gita]], and [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''. The last of these describes, in Lavezzoli's words, a \"search for universal truth, a journey that Coltrane had also undertaken. Yogananda believed that both Eastern and Western spiritual paths were efficacious, and wrote of the similarities between [[Krishna]] and Christ. This openness to different traditions resonated with Coltrane, who studied the [[Qur'an]], the [[Bible]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[astrology]] with equal sincerity.\"<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 280\u2013281.</ref> He also explored [[Hinduism]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[African history]], the philosophical teachings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]],<ref>{{cite web |title= John Coltrane, \"A Love Supreme\" and GOD |author= Emmett G.

Coltrane described ''Om'' as the \"first syllable, the primal word, the word of power\".<ref>Porter, p. 265.</ref> The 29-minute recording contains chants from the Hindu ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''<ref>Lavezzoli, p. 285: \"Coltrane and one or two other musicians begin and end the piece by chanting in unison a verse from chapter nine (\"The Yoga of Mysticism\") of the ''Bhagavad Gita'': Rites that the [[Vedas]] ordain, and the rituals taught by the scriptures: all these I am, and the offering made to the ghosts of the fathers, herbs of healing and food, the mantram, the clarified butter. I the [[oblation]], and I the flame into which it is offered. I am the sire of the world, and this world's mother and grandsire. I am he who awards to each the fruit of his action. I make all things clean. I am ''Om!''\"</ref> and the Buddhist ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'',<ref>Nisenson, p. 183.</ref> and a recitation of a passage describing the primal verbalization \"om\" as a cosmic/spiritual common denominator in all things.\n\n===Study of world music===\nColtrane's spiritual journey was interwoven with his investigation of world music. He believed in not only a universal musical structure that transcended ethnic distinctions, but also being able to harness the mystical language of music itself. His study of Indian music led him to believe that certain sounds and scales could \"produce specific emotional meanings.\" According to Coltrane, the goal of a musician was to understand these forces, control them, and elicit a response from the audience. He said, \"I would like to bring to people something like happiness. I would like to discover a method so that if I want it to rain, it will start right away to rain. If one of my friends is ill, I'd like to play a certain song and he will be cured; when he'd be broke, I'd bring out a different song and immediately he'd receive all the money he needed.\"<ref>Porter, p. 211.</ref>\n\n== Veneration ==\n{{Infobox saint\n| name      = [[Saint John Coltrane]]\n| image = JohnColtraneWiki.jpg\n| caption = Coltrane icon at St. John Coltrane African Orthodox Church\n| birth_date = {{birth date|mf=yes|1926|9|23}}\n| birth_place = Hamlet, North Carolina, US\n| death_date = {{death date and age |1967|07|17|1926|09|23}}\n| death_place = Huntington, New York, US\n| venerated_in = [[African Orthodox Church]]<br>[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]\n| feast_day        = December 8 (AOC)\n| canonized_date   = 1982\n| canonized_place  = St. John Coltrane Church, 2097 Turk Blvd, [[San Francisco]], CA 94115\n| canonized_by     = [[African Orthodox Church]]<ref name=\"Church\"/>\n| patronage = All Artists\n}}\n\nAfter Coltrane's death, a congregation called the Yardbird Temple in [[San Francisco]] began worshiping him as God incarnate.<ref name=\"Sunday\">{{cite news |last=Freedman |first=Samuel G. |title=Sunday religion, inspired by Saturday nights |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/01/us/01religion.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |date=December 1, 2007}}</ref> The group was named after [[Charlie Parker|Charlie \"Yardbird\" Parker]], whom they equated to [[John the Baptist]].<ref name=\"Sunday\" /> The congregation became affiliated with the [[African Orthodox Church]]; this involved changing Coltrane's status from a god to a saint.<ref name=\"Sunday\" /> The resultant [[St. John Coltrane African Orthodox Church]], San Francisco, is the only African Orthodox church that incorporates Coltrane's music and his lyrics as prayers in its liturgy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elvispelvis.com/jazzchurch.htm |title=The Jazz Church |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812213403/http://elvispelvis.com/jazzchurch.htm |archive-date=August 12, 2006 |first=Gordon |last=Polatnick |website=Elvispelvis.com}}</ref>\n[[File:Coltranechurch1k.jpg|left|thumb|Musicians at St John Coltrane African Orthodox Church, San Francisco 2009]]\nRev.
