[[Columbia Records]] had begun to pressure Nas to work towards more commercial topics, such as that of [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], who had become successful by releasing street singles that still retained radio-friendly appeal. The album also expanded on Nas's Escobar persona, who lived a ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''/''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''-esque lifestyle.

The video featured Nas and Combs being [[crucifixion|crucified]] in a manner similar to Jesus Christ; after the video was completed, Combs requested his crucifixion scene be edited out of the video. However, the unedited copy of the \"Hate Me Now\" video made its way to MTV. Within minutes of the broadcast, Combs and his bodyguards allegedly made their way into [[Steve Stoute]]'s office and assaulted him, at one point apparently hitting Stoute over the head with a champagne bottle.

In response to this, Jay-Z asked producer Ski Beatz to sample a line from Nas's song ''[[The World Is Yours (Nas song)|The World is Yours]]'', with the sample featured heavily in what went on to be ''[[Dead Presidents II]]''. The two traded subliminal responses for the next couple of years, until the beef was escalated further in 2001 after Jay-Z publicly addressed Nas at the [[Summer Jam (festival)|Summer Jam]], performing what would go on to be known as ''[[Takeover (song)|Takeover]]'', ending the performance by saying \"ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov\".
