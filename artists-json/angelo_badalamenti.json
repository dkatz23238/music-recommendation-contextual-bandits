By the time Badalamenti was a teenager, his aptitude at the piano earned him a summer job accompanying singers at resorts in the [[Catskill Mountains]].{{sfn|Contemporary Musicians 1996}} He attended [[Lafayette High School (New York City, New York)|Lafayette High School]]. Then he enrolled at the [[Eastman School of Music]] at the [[University of Rochester]], but after two years he transferred to the [[Manhattan School of Music]], where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1958 and a master's degree in 1959.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-08-01 |title=An Interview with Angelo Badalamenti |url=https://believermag.com/an-interview-with-angelo-badalamenti/ |access-date=2022-04-22 |website=Believer Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Alumni: Awards |url=https://www.msmnyc.edu/alumni/awards/ |access-date=2022-04-22 |website=Manhattan School of Music |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Film and television scoring==\nBadalamenti scored films such as ''[[Gordon's War]]'', and ''[[Law and Disorder (1974 film)|Law and Disorder]]'', but his break came when he was brought in to be [[Isabella Rossellini]]'s singing coach for the song \"[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]\" in [[David Lynch]]'s 1986 film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''.{{sfn|Garvey 2017}} Inspired by [[This Mortal Coil]]'s recent cover of [[Tim Buckley]]'s \"[[Song to the Siren (Tim Buckley song)|Song to the Siren]]\", Lynch had wanted Rossellini to sing her own version, but was unable to secure the rights. In its place, Badalamenti and Lynch collaborated to write \"Mysteries of Love\" using lyrics Lynch wrote and Badalamenti's music. [[Julee Cruise]], who went on to work with Lynch and Badalamenti on other projects, performed the vocals for the track. Badalamenti composed the score for the film and served as music supervisor. Lynch's request to the composer was for the score  to be \"like [[Shostakovich]], be very [[Russian classical music|Russian]], but make it the most beautiful thing but make it dark and a little bit scary.\"{{sfn|Chion 1995}} Badalamenti appears in ''Blue Velvet'' as the piano player in the club where Rossellini's character performs. This film was the first of what would become a career-long collaborative relationship spanning television and film.{{sfn|Garvey 2017}}\n\nAfter scoring a variety of mainstream films, including ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' and ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'', Badalamenti once again collaborated with Lynch and scored Lynch's cult television show, ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' which featured the vocals of Julee Cruise.{{sfn|Naftule 2017}}{{sfn|Tedder 2017}} ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' would become the score Badalamenti is perhaps best known for, one that helped define the overall style and mood of the show.{{sfn|Naftule 2017}} The score features different themes patterned after specific characters in the show\u2014\"Audrey's Dance\", for example, is an \"abstract jazzy\" theme that plays when [[Audrey Horne]] (played by [[Sherilyn Fenn]]) is on-screen.{{sfn|Deyneko 2015}} Many of the songs from the series were released on Cruise's album ''[[Floating into the Night]]''.{{sfn|Jenkins and Huddleston 2017}} From the soundtrack of the television series, he was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]] for the \"Twin Peaks Theme\".{{sfn|Grammy 1990}} it also earned a gold plaque from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].{{sfn|Grow 2014}}\n\nOther Lynch projects he worked on include the movies ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'', ''[[Lost Highway (1997 film)|Lost Highway]]'', ''[[The Straight Story]]'', ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (where he has a small role as a [[gangster]] with a finicky taste for [[espresso]]), and ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'' as well as the television shows ''[[On the Air (TV series)|On the Air]]'' and ''[[Hotel Room]]''.{{sfn|Rogers 2019}} Other projects he has worked in include the television film ''Witch Hunt'', and the films ''[[Naked in New York]]'', ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'', ''[[A Very Long Engagement]]'', ''[[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|The Wicker Man]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]'' and ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]''.

In 1998, Badalamenti recorded \"[[A Foggy Day (in London Town)]]\" with artist [[David Bowie]] for the [[Red Hot Organization]]\u2019s compilation album ''[[Red Hot + Rhapsody]]'' a tribute to [[George Gershwin]] which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. In 2005, he composed the themes for the movie [[Before the Fall (2004 film)|''Napola'' (''Before the Fall'')]], which were then adapted for the score by [[Normand Corbeil]]. In 2008, he directed the soundtrack of ''[[The Edge of Love]]'', with [[Siouxsie]], [[Patrick Wolf]] and [[Beth Rowley]] on vocals.\n\nBadalamenti received the ''Lifetime Achievement Award'' at the [[World Soundtrack Awards]] in 2008.{{sfn|World Soundtrack Academy 2008}} On July 23, 2011, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers presented Badalamenti with the Henry Mancini Award for his accomplishments in film and television music.{{sfn|Hurst 2011}}\n\nThe [[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|2017 revival]] of the ''Twin Peaks'' television series marked the continuation of Badalamenti's work with David Lynch. Its score features new compositions by Badalamenti, as well as material from the original score.{{sfn|Naftule 2017}}\n\n==Collaborations==\nIn 1966, Badalamenti co-wrote a song (\"Visa to the Stars\") on [[Perrey and Kingsley]]'s album ''[[The In Sound from Way Out!
