The band consists of [[Rachel Goswell]] on vocals and guitar, [[Neil Halstead]] on vocals and guitar, [[Christian Savill]] on guitar, Nick Chaplin on bass and [[Simon Scott (drummer)|Simon Scott]] on drums, all of whom have played on the band's debut ''[[Just for a Day]]'' in 1991. Halstead is the band's primary songwriter.\n\nGoswell and Halstead had known each other since early childhood. The band is one of the most prominent within the [[shoegaze]] scene, which rose to prominence in England during the early 1990s. While the band's second album ''[[Souvlaki (album)|Souvlaki]]'' initially received mixed reviews upon release, it has since been recognized as one of the best releases of the 1990s and one of the greatest shoegaze albums of all time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time - Page 5 |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/9966-the-50-best-shoegaze-albums-of-all-time/?page=5 |access-date=2022-09-02 |website=Pitchfork |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Beaumont |first=Mark |date=2017-01-06 |title=The 10 best shoegaze albums ever |url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/ten-best-shoegaze-albums-ever-1936528 |access-date=2022-09-02 |website=NME |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-07-09 |title=The 50 best shoegaze albums of all time |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-50-best-shoegaze-albums-of-all-time/ |access-date=2022-09-02 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-12 |title=10 Essential Shoegaze Albums That Aren\u2019t \u2018Loveless\u2019, PopMatters |url=https://www.popmatters.com/10-best-shoegaze-albums-2495726806.html |access-date=2022-09-02 |website=PopMatters |language=en-US}}</ref> \n\nThe band broke up soon after the release of their third album ''[[Pygmalion (album)|Pygmalion]]'' in 1995, having seen Scott, Savill and Chaplin all depart the band prior. The remaining members continued under a more folk and country-influenced direction as [[Mojave 3]]. Slowdive reunited in 2014 to play the [[Primavera Sound]] festival, and released a [[Slowdive (album)|self-titled]] album in 2017, their first in 22 years.\n\n==History==\n\n===1989\u20131991: Formation and early EPs===\nSlowdive was formed in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], England, by [[Neil Halstead]] and [[Rachel Goswell]] in October 1989. The two sang and played guitar, and had been friends since they were 6 years old. At a Sunday youth group, they began making music in an [[indie pop]] band called the Pumpkin Fairies, with bassist Mike Cottle and drummer Adrian Sell. When the Pumpkin Fairies disbanded, Slowdive formed, also including drummer Adrian Sell and Sell's friend, bassist Nick Chaplin. A third guitarist named Christian Savill, previously of the band Eternal, joined when he became the only person to answer an advert from the band. The ad called for a female guitarist, but Savill wanted to join so badly he offered to wear a dress. He was subsequently recruited.<ref name = \"WATSON_2A\">Watson (2005a), p. 2</ref> The name \"Slowdive\" was inspired by two events: a dream Chaplin experienced,<ref>{{cite web |last=Strutt |url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/7344/Slowdive-Interview | publisher= Pennyblackmusic.co.uk |title=Slowdive interview |date=24 February 2014 |access-date= 1 July 2015}}</ref> and a conversation he had with Goswell, who suggested \"[[Slowdive (song)|Slowdive]]\", the name of a single by one of her favourite bands, [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Eisenhardt |first=Asa |url=http://whenthesunhitsblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/wtsh-interviews-neil-halstead-simon.html |title=WTSH interviews with Neil Halstead and Simon Scoot of Slowdive |publisher=When the sun hits |date=1 August 2014 |access-date=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe band quickly recorded a demo and several months later played a show with the band [[Five Thirty]]. Steve Walters, head of [[Artist and repertoire|A&R]] at [[EMI]], had attended the show. Afterward, he approached Savill and requested one of their demos. Slowdive signed to [[Creation Records]] shortly after. The average age of the band was 19 at the time.<ref name = \"BUCKLEY_ROCK\">{{cite book | title = The Rough Guide To Rock | author = Buckley, Peter | publisher = [[Rough Guides]] | edition = 3rd | date = November 2003 | page = [https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/956 956] | isbn = 1-84353-105-4 | url = https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/956 }}</ref> Sell felt things were progressing too fast and left for university after being in the band for about six months.<ref name = \"WATSON_2A\"/><ref name = \"NME_BIO\">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.nme.com/artists/slowdive | title = Slowdive biography | author = NME staff | magazine = [[NME]] | access-date = 2009-08-22}}</ref>\n\nA [[Slowdive (EP)|self-titled EP]] was released in November 1990 and received praise from music critics.<ref name = \"BUCKLEY_ROCK\"/> ''Slowdive'' was actually their original demo; the band had preferred the older recordings after feeling disillusioned with their studio craft.<ref name = \"WATSON_4A\">Watson (2005a), p. 4</ref> In a glowing recommendation, ''[[NME]]'' staff member Simon Williams wrote \"Slowdive have banished the barrier restricting creativity...

The British music press became increasingly derisive of shoegazing as the [[Britpop]] and [[grunge]] movements came underway.<ref name = \"ALLMUSIC_BIO\"/><ref name = \"BUCKLEY_ROCK\"/>\n\nProduction on Slowdive's debut commenced shortly after Halstead convinced [[Alan McGee]], head of Creation Records, that the band had enough songs written for a full-length album, which was not actually true. The group hurriedly started writing songs in the studio. Experimentation with sounds and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] occurred during the process. Halstead drew lyrical inspiration from the abstract nature of the music. He recounted, \"[We] went into a studio for six weeks and had no songs at the start and at the end we had an album\".<ref name = \"WATSON_4A\"/>\n\nTheir debut, ''[[Just for a Day]]'' was released in September 1991 and placed in the top 10 on the UK Indie Chart.<ref name = \"ALLMUSIC_BIO\"/> ''NME'' gave the record a positive review,<ref name = \"WATSON_6A\"/> but most of the press generally disliked the album as a backlash against shoegazing began.<ref name = \"ALLMUSIC_BIO\"/> As writer Peter Buckley put it, the album was \"dismissed as dreary and lacking in ideas\".<ref name = \"BUCKLEY_ROCK\"/> ''Melody Maker'' writer Paul Lester railed against the debut, calling it a \"major fucking letdown\".<ref name = \"WATSON_6A\">Watson (2005a), p. 6</ref> This backlash worsened when critics reevaluated shoegazing after the release of My Bloody Valentine's ''[[Loveless (My Bloody Valentine album)|Loveless]]'' in November 1991.<ref name = \"BUCKLEY_ROCK\"/>\n\nA tour of the United Kingdom followed in autumn 1991. Afterward, the group made their first visit to the United States and toured with [[alternative rock]] band [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. A tour of Europe followed in February 1992.<ref name = \"WATSON_2B\">Watson (2005b), p.2</ref> Slowdive's US label [[SBK Records]] planned to release ''Just for a Day'' at the beginning of the year, but not before initiating a [[viral marketing]] campaign. The band's name was stenciled outside [[MTV]] and radio stations in New York. Fans stencilled their heads when Slowdive played in Manhattan. The campaign caused some controversy when a statue celebrating the end of slavery was unveiled and had the word \"Slowdive\" stencilled on it. SBK eventually pushed the release date back three months, which hurt the viral campaign.<ref name = \"WATSON_4B\">Watson (2005b), p. 4</ref>\n\n===1992\u20131994: ''Souvlaki''===\n{{listen|\n |filename    = Slowdive - When the Sun Hits (Sample).ogg\n |title       = Slowdive: \"When the Sun Hits\"\n |description = from the 1993 album ''[[Souvlaki (album)|Souvlaki]]''.}}\nWhile they toured in early 1992 to support ''[[Blue Day]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creation-records.com/ride-going-blank-again-20th-anniversary/|title=Celebrating 20 years of Ride's Going Blank Again \u2013 Creation Records|first=Stewart|last=Nash|website=creation-records.com}}</ref> a re-release of their early EP material, the band began writing songs for a follow-up album, but the negative coverage Slowdive received in the press affected their songwriting. \"[It] did affect us as we were all teenagers at the time\", said Scott in a 2009 interview, \"[We] couldn't understand why people were so outraged by our sound that they had to tell the NME or whoever that they wanted us dead!\"<ref name = \"DIS_SCOTT\">{{cite magazine | url = http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4136609 | title = Shoegaze Week: DiS talks to Simon Scott about his time in Slowdive | author = Gourlay, Dom | magazine = [[Drowned in Sound]] | date = 2009-04-23 | access-date = 2009-08-23 | archive-date = 26 April 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090426223117/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4136609 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Approximately 40 songs were recorded and rerecorded as the group became very self-conscious of their writing and how it might be received. When McGee listened to the new material, he subsequently dismissed it, stating, \"They're all shit\". The band discarded all the music and started over.<ref name = \"WATSON_4B\"/> In a 2009 interview, Halstead vividly recalled the incident: \"I remember going to start the record in a studio in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. [[Spiritualized]] had just been there and left a huge [[Scalextric|Scalextrix]] in the live room. I remember thinking this was the height of indulgence!

I don't care what you are going to play, just play something.'\" Two songs from the collaboration appeared on the ensuing album: \"Sing\", which was co-written with Eno, and \"Here She Comes\", where Eno played keyboards.<ref name = \"WATSON_4B\"/>\n\nCreation Records wanted Slowdive to produce a commercial sounding album.<ref name = \"DIS_BIO\">{{cite magazine | url = http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4136640-shoegaze-week--slowdive--ecstasy-without-the-clubbing | title = Shoegaze Week: Slowdive: \"ecstasy without the clubbing\" | author = Tudor, Alexander | magazine = [[Drowned in Sound]] | date = 2009-04-23 | access-date = 2009-08-23 | archive-date = 7 November 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101107012100/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4136640-shoegaze-week--slowdive--ecstasy-without-the-clubbing | url-status = dead }}</ref> Halstead agreed: \"We wanted to make a 'pop' record but it took a while to record\".<ref name = \"DIS_HALSTEAD\"/> At one point, Halstead suddenly left in summer 1992, seeking seclusion in a Welsh cottage. Savill, Chaplin and Scott were left in a recording studio in [[Weston-super-Mare]], and while waiting for Halstead's return, recorded some \"joke songs\". To their misfortune, McGee acquired them and became despondent, by which time Halstead had arrived with new music, including \"Dagger\" and \"40 Days.\"<ref name = \"WATSON_4B\"/> The band named their second album ''[[Souvlaki (album)|Souvlaki]]'' after a skit performed by [[the Jerky Boys]], an American comedy duo that recorded [[Prank call|prank phone calls]].<ref name = \"WATSON_2B\"/>\n\n''Souvlaki'' was released in May 1993 alongside the ''[[Outside Your Room| Outside Your Room EP]]'',<ref name = \"BUCKLEY_ROCK\"/> a few months after [[Suede (band)|Suede]] released their [[Suede (album)|popular debut]] and the Britpop movement began.<ref name = \"WATSON_6B\">Watson (2005b), p. 6</ref> Critical reaction, as with their previous album, was generally negative. ''NME'' writer John Mulvey gave an ambivalent review. Despite noting their dated and \"unfulfilling\" sound, he did call it an \"exemplary product\". Dave Simpson, writing for ''Melody Maker'', declared, \"[This] record is a soulless void [...] I would rather drown choking in a bath full of porridge than ever listen to it again\".<ref name = \"WATSON_6B\"/> To make matters worse, Slowdive booked a tour with fellow shoegazers [[Catherine Wheel (band)|Catherine Wheel]] for a tour of the United States, only to find SBK had pushed the album's US release date back eight months. The band recorded an EP, titled ''5 EP'', and started a modest tour through Europe with dream pop band [[Cranes (band)|Cranes]]. Scott was unhappy with the gap between releases and quit the band in 1994.<ref name = \"WATSON_2C\">Watson (2005c), p. 2</ref>\n\nA marketing campaign was started in early 1994 to promote ''Souvlaki'' in the United States, which ''[[AllMusic]]'' writer Andy Kellman said would \"undoubtedly go down in industry history as one of the laziest ever\"; SBK sent fans a release flyer and were told that if they copied and posted 50 flyers around town, they would receive a free copy of ''Souvlaki''. Fans who participated had to document their progress with photographs to prove they actually performed the activity.<ref name = \"ALLMUSIC_BIO\"/> Halfway through the ''Souvlaki'' US tour, SBK pulled their funding and left Slowdive to pay the rest themselves. In 1994, the band funded two small tours of the United States using money raised through the sale of a live tape and a tour programme that mocked the record label.<ref name = \"WATSON_2C\"/>\n\n===1994\u20131995: ''Pygmalion''===\nScott was replaced on drums by Ian McCutcheon. By the recording of their final album, ''[[Pygmalion_(album)|Pygmalion]]'', Halstead had moved Slowdive away from the dreamy guitar sound and warm yet solemn tone of earlier releases to a newer, more minimalist extreme, similar to heavily ambient bands such as [[Seefeel]], [[A.R. Kane]] and [[Labradford]].\n\nSlowdive were dropped by Creation a week after the release of ''Pygmalion'' (as were [[Swervedriver]] not long after).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1484-slowdive-on-their-first-album-in-22-years-and-why-shoegaze-came-back|title=Slowdive on Their First Album in 22 Years and Why Shoegaze Came Back|date=10 April 2017|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=3 May 2021}}</ref>\n\n===1995\u20132014: Post-Slowdive endeavours===\nShortly after being dropped by Creation, Halstead, Goswell and McCutcheon recorded an album of country-influenced songs, and were signed to label [[4AD]], changing the band name to [[Mojave 3]] to reflect the new musical direction. This group is currently on hiatus.\n\nDrummer Scott went on to form Televise, taking the ambient shoegazing sound and pushing it into electronic fields similar to [[Fennesz]]. He joined [[Lowgold]] in 1999. Scott later went on to release solo records on the [[12k]], Miasmah, Sonic Pieces and [[Kompakt]] labels, and co-write and perform with [[Ghostly International]]-signed Seattle band [[the Sight Below]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fluid-radio.co.uk/2009/09/navigare/ |title=Navigare Review |publisher=Fluid Radio |access-date=2012-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204075439/http://www.fluid-radio.co.uk/2009/09/navigare/ |archive-date=4 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nSavill went on to form [[Monster Movie (band)|Monster Movie]], a dream pop group that maintained much of the older Slowdive style.
