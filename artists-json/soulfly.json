Soulfly is led by former [[Sepultura]] frontman [[Max Cavalera]], who formed the band after he left the Brazilian group in 1996. To date the band has released twelve [[studio album]]s, one tour [[Extended play|EP]], twenty-three [[Single (music)|single]]s, one [[video album]], and twelve [[music video]]s. Their debut album, ''[[Soulfly (Soulfly album)|Soulfly]]'', was released on April 21, 1998, while their most recent album, ''Totem'', was released on August 5, 2022\n\nSoulfly incorporates many styles of metal with Brazilian tribal and [[world music]], much like Cavalera's previous band Sepultura. The original lyrical content revolved around [[spirituality]], political and religious themes, with later albums encompassing other themes including war, violence, aggression, slavery, hatred and anger. All of their first six studio albums debuted on the United States [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with a peak position at number 32 for their second album, ''[[Primitive (Soulfly album)|Primitive]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title= Top Music Charts \u2013 Hot 100 \u2013 Billboard 200 \u2013 Music Genre Sales |publisher=Billboard Music Charts |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2000-10-14/billboard-200 |access-date=February 28, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ''Soulfly'' has been certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum |publisher=RIAA |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |access-date=February 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Soulfly.svg|thumb|The band's logo]]\n===Formation, self-titled album, and ''Primitive'' (1997\u20132001)===\nSoulfly was formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1997.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&q=%22formed%22+Soulfly+1997&pg=RA1-PA1882|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|date=May 27, 2011|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-595-8}}</ref> Max Cavalera was troubled during the recording of Soulfly's self-titled album, and on the band's website he said that he founded the band \"with the idea of combined sounds and spiritual beliefs\".

Bell]], [[Dino Cazares]] and [[Christian Olde Wolbers]] from [[Fear Factory]], [[Fred Durst]] and [[DJ Lethal]] from [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Chino Moreno]] from [[Deftones]], [[Benji Webbe]] formerly of Welsh band [[Dub War]] and now a member of [[Skindred]], [[Eric \"Bobo\" Correa|Eric Bobo]] from [[Cypress Hill]], Jorge do Peixe and Gilmar Bola Oito from [[Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]], and [[Mario C.]] The album was recorded at Indigo Ranch Studios in Malibu, California, and was overseen by producer [[Ross Robinson]].\n\nIn addition to fronting Soulfly, Cavalera also branched out into other areas not usually associated with heavy metal musicians. He became a speaker at music conventions, appearing at [[CMJ]]'s New Music Marathon in New York and Holland's Crossing Border Festival, both in late 1997, and sang a TV commercial for [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] in Brazil. After recording the first album, Jackson Bandeira returned to Brazil with [[Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]] and was replaced by [[Logan Mader]] of [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] for the live tour that followed. Soulfly played on the 1998 [[Ozzfest]] mainstage alongside [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Tool (band)|Tool]], and played small club tours around the world with bands such as [[System of a Down (band)|System of a Down]] and [[Snot (band)|Snot]]. After the world tour in support of ''Soulfly'', Logan Mader was replaced by [[Mikey Doling]] who had just been displaced by the breakup of Snot.\n\nA variety of influences, including [[nu metal]], appeared on 2000s ''[[Primitive (Soulfly album)|Primitive]]'', and it was the most successful album by the band in the U.S., reaching number 32 on the Billboard 200 and number 11 on the independent charts. [[Joe Nunez]], from Chicago, replaced [[Roy Mayorga]] on drums for ''Primitive''. The album featured a number of guest appearances as well, including [[Corey Taylor]] of [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Stone Sour]], [[Sean Lennon]], [[Chino Moreno]] of [[Deftones]], [[Tom Araya]] of [[Slayer]], Grady Avenell of [[Will Haven]], Cutthroat Logic, Babatunde and Asha Rabouin and was produced by [[Toby Wright]]. In addition, artwork was created by longtime [[Bob Marley]] artist [[Neville Garrick]]. The release of the album was followed by world tours with the likes of [[Pantera]], [[Morbid Angel]] and [[Ozzfest]].\n\n=== ''3'', new line-up and ''Prophecy'' (2002\u20132004)<span id=\"3 and Prophecy (2002\u20132004)\"></span> ===\nIn late 2001, Joe Nunez left Soulfly to join Stripping the Pistol, saying that it was \"time for [him] to move on\".

''[[3 (Soulfly album)|3]]''<ref>[http://www.Soulflyweb.com/msc.html Official Soufly website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106013150/http://www.Soulflyweb.com/msc.html |date=January 6, 2010 }} determines the album title as \"3\"</ref><!-- Please don't move the article or change the title of the album to something else than \"3\". Such actions as an interpretation of the album cover are original research. The official title is \"3\", not \"om\" or \"\u0950\" or anything else. --> was the first Soulfly album which was produced by Max Cavalera. Other musicians performing on ''3'' included [[Cristian Machado]] of [[Ill Ni\u00f1o]], and guitarist Wiley Arnet and drummer Greg Hall, and Max's stepson [[Incite (band)|Richie Cavalera]]. The album reached number 46 on the Billboard 200 in that year. After the release of ''3 '' on June 25, 2002, Soulfly toured throughout Europe and North America with bands such as Slayer, [[In Flames]], [[God Forbid]], and [[Will Haven]].\n\nIn September 2003, after the world tour for ''3'', Dias was fired from the band, and Mayorga and Doling both left the band in protest, leaving Cavalera as the sole remaining member for a period of three weeks.\n\nCavalera recruited a new lineup in October 2003 for the recording of Soulfly's ''[[Prophecy (Soulfly album)|Prophecy]]'' album. Joe Nunez returned on drums with Kentucky native Bobby Burns, formerly of [[Primer 55]], on bass and New Jersey native [[Marc Rizzo]], formerly of [[Ill Ni\u00f1o]], on lead guitar. [[David Ellefson]], formerly of [[Megadeth]] at the time, also played bass on several of the album's songs.\n\n[[Max Cavalera]] explained on the band's website that he wanted to use different musicians as part of the group for each album. \"This is an approach that I've wanted to do for a while. I never wanted Soulfly to be a band like [[Metallica]], with the same four guys. On every Soulfly album, we've changed the line up and it will probably continue that way. In order to do that, I had to start from the inside out and bring in people who caught my attention, that I had never played with before, and create this.\" While a member of [[Sepultura]], Cavalera had shown an interest in [[world music]] as shown in ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]'', featuring elements of the music of Brazil's indigenous peoples. This approach continued on the ''Prophecy'' album, with Cavalera traveling to Serbia to record with traditional musicians. On the song \"Moses\", he worked with Serbian band [[Eyesburn]], which also features reggae influences from one of his heroes, [[Bob Marley]]. Other tracks on the album feature instruments from the Middle Ages, sheepskin bagpipes, and Serbian Gypsies. Danny Marianino and Asha Rabouin returned as guest vocalists on ''Prophecy'', as well, and Max Cavalera produced the album. ''Prophecy'' was released on March 30, 2004, and in April of that year had reached a peak of number 82 on the Billboard 200, although it has reached the top 50 of the Australian album charts. Soulfly followed the album release with tours supporting [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Morbid Angel]].\n\nIn February 2005, Soulfly released their first DVD, entitled ''The Song Remains Insane''. This was a biography of the band, containing live footage from all over the globe, interviews, and all of the band's music videos. In August 2005, [[Roadrunner Records]] reissued their self-titled first album as part of the label's 25th anniversary celebration.\n\n=== ''Dark Ages'' (2005\u20132007) ===\nIn December 2004, as recording was beginning for Soulfly's fifth studio album, the band was rocked by several tragedies that affected the outcome of the album. On December 8, Cavalera's friend [[Dimebag Darrell|\"Dimebag\" Darrell Abbott]] was shot and killed while playing in Ohio, and on December 10, Cavalera's eight-month-old grandson Moses unexpectedly died due to health complications. The following fall, on October 4, 2005, ''[[Dark Ages (album)|Dark Ages]]'' was released. Many critics have described ''Dark Ages'' as a return to Cavalera's [[thrash metal]] roots of the early [[Sepultura]] days; however, the [[world music]] influence found on the first four Soulfly albums is still present. In fact, this time, Cavalera traveled to five different countries &mdash; Serbia, Turkey, Russia, France, and the United States &mdash; in order to record all the sounds that he desired to have on the new album.\n\nThe core band on ''Dark Ages'' still consisted of Cavalera, Joe Nunez, Bobby Burns and Marc Rizzo, and on this album, [[Dave Ellefson]] came back to lend his talents to a couple of tracks, [[Eyesburn]] vocalist [[Hornsman Coyote|Coyote]] sang on \"[[Innerspirit]]\", [[Stormtroopers of Death]] vocalist [[Billy Milano]] and Russian singer Paul Fillipenko  of FAQ screamed on the [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] influenced \"Molotov\", and Max's stepson, Ritchie Cavalera from Phoenix-based band Incite, sang on \"Staystrong\". Soulfly supported ''Dark Ages'' on a world tour with various bands such as [[Deftones]], [[Korn]], [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]], and [[Skindred]] that has stretched through North America, South America, Europe, Russia, and Australia.\n\nOn August 17, 2006, Soulfly played the 10th Annual D-Low Memorial show with several guest artists including [[Dave Ellefson]] and [[Roy Mayorga]], the latter of whom who currently plays with [[Stone Sour]]. Most notably, Max was reunited onstage for the first time in 10 years with his brother [[Igor Cavalera]]. Max and Igor formed [[Sepultura]] together in the early 1980s, but had not played together since Max's departure in 1997. Igor joined the band midway through the set for a jam on the drums and stayed onstage to play the Sepultura classics \"[[Roots Bloody Roots]]\" and \"[[Attitude (Sepultura song)|Attitude]]\" on Joe Nunez's drum kit.\n\nIn the time between legs of Soulfly's world tour for ''Dark Ages'' and afterwards, members of Soulfly stayed extremely busy by focusing on  projects and activities outside of the band. Cavalera guested on the [[Apocalyptica]] single \"[[Repressed]]\" with [[Bullet For My Valentine]] vocalist [[Matt Tuck]] during a visit to Germany, went to Russia in January 2007 to guest on the album ''Circus Dogs'' by Russian hardcore band FAQ and played on Saint-Petersbourg with Radiohead album sound producer Nike \"Naik\" Groshin, played a surprise jam session in Serbia with [[Dan Lilker]] of [[Brutal Truth]] and [[Stormtroopers of Death|S.O.D.]], and spent time in [[Arizona]] writing for future releases. Marc Rizzo spent the year on the road throughout [[North America]] playing his solo flamenco-meets-shred metal, gaining him further recognition as one of the world's premier metal guitarists. Earlier in 2005, Rizzo had released his debut solo album, ''Colossal Myopia'', through [[Shrapnel Records]], and in 2007 he prepared his follow-up, ''The Ultimate Devotion'', which has now been released. Burns purchased a studio in [[Orlando, Florida]] with his partner Tim Lau, revived his former band Primer 55, and worked on new releases for his Love Said No and King Street projects. In September 2006, Burns suffered a mild stroke, was forced to sit out of Soulfly's North American tour, and his spot in the band was briefly filled by [[Dave Ellefson]] and [[Danny Lilker]]. Nunez worked on the development of several drum accessories with Slug Drums, and taught drum lessons and worked construction in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. Soulfly ventured to Undercity Recording Studios in March 2007 to record a cover of the [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] single \"[[The Beautiful People (song)|The Beautiful People]]\" with Logan Mader producing. The song was later released in June 2007 by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine in issue 1164 as part of their ''Higher Voltage'' compilation. During time in the studio, Max Cavalera also recorded vocals for the song \"War Is My Destiny\" with [[Ill Bill]] and [[Immortal Technique]] for Ill Bill's second studio album, ''[[The Hour of Reprisal]]'', which released on September 16, 2008.\n\n=== ''Conquer'' and ''Omen'' (2008\u20132010) ===\n\nIn August 2007, Soulfly did a tour that consisted of a mixture of festival and club shows through Europe before playing the 11th Annual D-Low Memorial Show in [[Tempe, Arizona]] on August 31, 2007. [[Cavalera Conspiracy]] also made their debut live performance at the show by opening for Soulfly. One week after performing the show, Soulfly went to Bobby Burns and Tim Lau's newly renovated Porch Studio in [[Orlando, Florida]] to begin work on their sixth studio album, which Cavalera had begun writing during the summer. After working halfway through recording until September 29, Cavalera halted the session to travel throughout Egypt to record more sounds to integrate into the new songs. In November 2007, Cavalera returned to Orlando to complete tracking and the album was mixed by [[Andy Sneap]] in early 2008. The album featured collaborations [[Dave Peters]] from [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]] and [[David Vincent (musician)|David Vincent]] from [[Morbid Angel]].\n[[File:Soulfly @ 70000 tons of metal 2015 03.jpg|thumb|Tony Campos performing in 2015]]\nSoulfly released their sixth album entitled ''[[Conquer (Soulfly album)|Conquer]]'' on July 29, 2008.
