Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including [[blues]], [[soul music]], [[psychedelic rock]] and traditional [[Irish folk music]], but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].\n\nTwo of the founding members, drummer [[Brian Downey (drummer)|Brian Downey]] and bass guitarist, lead vocalist and principal songwriter [[Phil Lynott]], met while still in school. Lynott led the group throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums, writing most of the material. The singles \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\" (a traditional Irish ballad), \"[[The Boys Are Back in Town]]\" and \"[[Waiting for an Alibi]]\" were international hits. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists [[Scott Gorham]] and [[John Sykes]], though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey. In 2012, Gorham and Downey decided against recording new material as Thin Lizzy so a new band, [[Black Star Riders]], was formed to tour and produce new releases, such as their debut album ''[[All Hell Breaks Loose (Black Star Riders album)|All Hell Breaks Loose]]''. Thin Lizzy have since reunited for occasional concerts.<ref name=\"noise11.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.noise11.com/news/exclusive-thin-lizzy-to-end-black-star-riders-to-begin-20121221 |title=Thin Lizzy to End, Black Star Riders to Begin |date=20 December 2012 |publisher=noise11.com}}</ref>\n\nLynott, Thin Lizzy's ''de facto'' leader, was composer or co-composer of almost all of the band's songs, and the first [[Black people in Ireland|black Irishman]] to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. Thin Lizzy featured several guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the [[rhythm section]], on the drums and bass guitar. As well as being multiracial, the band drew their early members not only from both sides of the [[Irish border]] but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during [[The Troubles]].\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock, \"far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223002851/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thinlizzy/biography Thin Lizzy]. ''Rolling Stone''.</ref> [[AllMusic]] critic John Dougan has written that \"As the band's creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life [[working-class]] dramas of love and hate influenced by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and virtually all of the [[Irish Literature|Irish literary tradition]].\"<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5633/biography|pure_url=yes}} Thin Lizzy: Biography].

Lynott, born on 20 August 1949 in [[West Bromwich]], England, to an Irish mother [[Philomena Lynott|Philomena]] (1930\u20132019) and [[Guyana|Guyanese]] father Cecil Parris (1925\u20132010), was brought up in Dublin from the age of three.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=14}} Downey was born on 27 January 1951 in Dublin. Lynott joined a local band, The Black Eagles, as vocalist in 1963, and Downey was recruited as drummer in 1965.{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=40}} In 1967, Lynott was asked to join [[Skid Row (Irish band)|Skid Row]] by bass guitarist [[Brush Shiels]],{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=56}} who brought teenage Belfast guitarist [[Gary Moore]] into the band early in 1968.{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=77}} After a disappointing television appearance in June 1969, Shiels fired Lynott, although they remained on good terms and Shiels subsequently taught Lynott to play bass guitar.{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=82}} Lynott then formed Orphanage with Downey on drums after Downey's previous band, Sugar Shack, had split.{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=94}}\n\nGuitarist [[Eric Bell]], born in Belfast on 3 September 1947, began his career playing in local bands such as The Deltones, Shades of Blue and The Bluebeats, and the last incarnation of [[Them (band)|Them]] to feature [[Van Morrison]], between September and October 1966.{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=97}} Bell later moved to Dublin and joined an [[Irish showband]] named The Dreams,{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=21}} but left in 1969 with a view to forming a rock band. An acquaintance of Bell's, Belfast organist [[Eric Wrixon]], also a former member of Them, had also moved to Dublin and joined the showband circuit, but had similar plans to progress towards rock music.{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=98}}\n\n===Early years (1969\u20131972)===\n[[File:Thin Lizzy founders.png|thumb|Brian Downey, Phil Lynott and Eric Bell, three of four founding members of Thin Lizzy]]\nIn December 1969, Bell and Wrixon met by chance in a pub in Dublin and found that they shared similar ideas of forming a band, and decided to visit the Countdown Club where they saw Lynott and Downey perform with Orphanage.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=27}} Lynott was not playing bass guitar at this time, but Bell was particularly impressed by Downey, and introduced himself to Lynott and Downey during a break.{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=99}} When Bell asked if they would consider forming a band together, Downey was initially sceptical, but both men were aware of Bell's musical reputation.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=41}} They agreed that night on condition that Lynott play bass guitar as well as sing, and that the band would perform some of Lynott's compositions.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=28}} Bell later said, \"From there on in we were a band.\"{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=22}} Wrixon was also included as organist in the as yet unnamed band, making the initial line-up a quartet.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=24}} The following week, Lynott visited Bell at his flat and played him recordings of some of his own songs. Bell was impressed: \"They were so good. I knew right away I could put my guitar style into them.\"{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=99}}\n\nThe band started to attract attention in the Irish music press almost immediately, as the band began rehearsals in January 1970. On 1 January, ''New Spotlight'' magazine announced that Bell and Wrixon were to be a part of a new band.{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=99}} By early February, the press had begun to question the delay in any public announcement of the \"Bell-Lynott supergroup\".{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=43}} The name Thin Lizzy was announced to the press on 18 February. The name came from a robot character in ''[[The Dandy]]'' called Tin Lizzie,<ref>{{cite news |last=Ritchie |first=Gayle |title=50 years of Thin Lizzy: Remembering the night frontman Phil Lynott took a tumble and fell into a Kirkcaldy crowd |work=Nostalgia |publisher=[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]] |date=6 July 2020 |url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/nostalgia/1403099/50-years-of-thin-lizzy-remembering-the-night-frontman-phil-lynott-took-a-tumble-and-fell-into-a-kirkcaldy-crowd/ |access-date=9 March 2021 }}</ref> which they adjusted to Thin Lizzy as a playful reference to the local Dublin accent, in which \"thin\" would be pronounced as \"t'in\".{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=30}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjMDAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT30|page=30|title=Thin Lizzy: The Boys Are Back in Town|author=Harry Doherty|publisher=Music Sales Group|date= 20 November 2012|isbn=9780857128010}}</ref> For some of their early gigs, the band were mistakenly promoted as \"Tin Lizzy\" or \"Tin Lizzie\".{{sfn|Brooks|2000|p=19}} The group's first gig was at a school hall in [[Cloghran, Coolock|Cloghran]], near [[Dublin Airport]],{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=100}}{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=47}} in 1970, though sources vary on the date from 16 February,{{sfn|Thomson|2016|p=100}} 19 February,{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=47}} and 20 February.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=45}}\n\nIn July 1970, the band released a single, \"The Farmer\"/\"I Need You\", on [[EMI]] with the B-side written by John D'ardis, who owned Trend Studios where the single was recorded. The single sold just 283 copies and is now a collectors' item.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=26}} Wrixon left the band before the single's release, meaning there was a greater share of income for the three remaining members.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=47}} He moved to mainland Europe before returning to Belfast, rejoining his old band, Them.{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=54}} Wrixon died on 13 July 2015.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hotpress.com/Eric-Wrixon/news/RIP-Eric-Wrixon/14591410.html |title=R.I.P. Eric Wrixon |date=13 July 2015 |magazine=Hot Press}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the year, Thin Lizzy were signed to [[Decca Records]] and they travelled to London in January 1971 to record their debut album, ''[[Thin Lizzy (album)|Thin Lizzy]]''. The album sold moderately well but did not chart in the UK, despite airplay and support from influential DJs [[John Peel]] and [[Kid Jensen]].{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=27}}\n\nAround March 1971, the band permanently relocated to London, before the release of the unsuccessful \"New Day\" [[Extended play|EP]] in August.{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=65}} Despite poor sales, Decca agreed to finance the band's second album ''[[Shades of a Blue Orphanage]]'', released in March 1972. Like the previous LP, the songs were filled with Lynott's personal anecdotes and references to his life in Dublin and the people he knew there. Musically the style was [[Celtic rock|Celtic]], with little warning of the hard rock direction that the band were to take in the future.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=34}} Again, the album did not chart in the UK.\n\nIn mid-1972, Thin Lizzy were asked to record an album of [[Deep Purple]] covers, which was released under the title ''[[Funky Junction]] Play a Tribute to Deep Purple''. No mention was made of Thin Lizzy on the record. Vocals and keyboards were handled by members of another band, Elmer Fudd, and a few instrumental tracks composed by the band were also included, including Bell playing the traditional \"[[Danny Boy]]\" in the style of [[Jimi Hendrix]]. The album was released in January 1973.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=64}}\n\n===\"Whiskey in the Jar\" (1972\u20131974)===\n[[File:Thin Lizzy - TopPop 1974 1.png|thumb|alt=The band pose with their instruments for a black-and-white photo and look to the camera|Thin Lizzy in early 1974 on [[TopPop]]. L\u2013R: [[Brian Downey (drummer)|Brian Downey]], [[Phil Lynott]], [[Gary Moore]].]]\n\nIn late 1972, the band embarked upon a high-profile tour of the UK with [[Slade]], who were enjoying a string of hit singles at the time, and [[Suzi Quatro]]. Around the same time, Decca released Thin Lizzy's version of a traditional [[Irish ballad]], \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\", as a single. The band was angry at the release, feeling that the song did not represent their sound or their image,{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=70}} but the single topped the Irish chart, and reached No.&nbsp;6 in the UK in February 1973, resulting in an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. It also charted in many countries across Europe. However, the follow-up single, \"Randolph's Tango\", was a return to Lynott's more obscure work, and it did not chart outside Ireland.{{sfn|Brooks|2000|p=36}}\n\nThe band's next album, ''[[Vagabonds of the Western World]]'', was released in September 1973 following strong airplay in the UK, but again failed to chart.{{sfn|Brooks|2000|p=37}} The accompanying single \"[[The Rocker (song)|The Rocker]]\" also found little success outside Ireland, and the momentum gained from their hit single was lost.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=83}}\n\nTowards the end of 1973, Eric Bell began to feel constricted with the changing style of the group, which left less room for free-form jamming and had people wanting the band to create a follow-up hit to \"Whiskey in the Jar\". Matters came to a head during a gig on New Year's Eve 1973 at [[Queen's University Belfast]], where he walked off stage halfway through the show and had to be persuaded to finish the set.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|pp=84-85}} The next day, he quit the group, and was immediately replaced by ex-Skid Row guitarist [[Gary Moore]] to help finish the tour.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|pp=86}} Moore stayed until April 1974; the band recorded three songs with him in that time, including the version of \"[[Still in Love with You (Thin Lizzy song)|Still in Love with You]]\" that was included on the fourth album ''[[Nightlife (Thin Lizzy album)|Nightlife]]''.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=89}} He left the group after being concerned about his health and struggling to compete with Lynott for control, and formed [[Colosseum II]] with [[Jon Hiseman]].{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=90}}\n\nWith the departure of Moore, Lynott decided to expand the line-up with two guitarists, and recruited two new members to complete a tour of Germany in May 1974. These were ex-[[Atomic Rooster]] and [[Hard Stuff]] guitarist [[John Du Cann|John Cann]], and Berlin-born [[Andy Gee]], who had played with [[Peter Bardens]] and [[Steve Ellis (musician)|Ellis]]. This lineup proved to be temporary, as Lynott and Cann did not get on personally,{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=91}} and Gee was under contract to another record label. The tour was ended early when a disillusioned Downey quit the band, and had to be begged to reconsider, at a time when Thin Lizzy's contract with Decca was coming to an end.{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=83}}\n\nAuditions were held for new members, and Lynott and Downey eventually settled on 18 year old Glaswegian guitarist [[Brian Robertson (guitarist)|Brian Robertson]], and Californian [[Scott Gorham]]. The new line-up gelled quickly, dropped most of the old songs when they played live,{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=98}} and secured a new record deal with [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]], but the resulting album ''Nightlife'' was a disappointment for the band due to its soft production and underdeveloped style.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=59}} Robertson described [[Ron Nevison]]'s production as \"pretty naff\" and Gorham said the record was \"ridiculously tame\".{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=101}} Like the previous three albums, it failed to chart, selling around 10,000 copies.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=102}}\n\n===\"The Boys Are Back in Town\" (1975\u20131977)===\n[[File:Phil-Lynott Thin Lizzy.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black-and-white photo of the band performing onstage|L\u2013R: [[Brian Robertson (guitarist)|Brian Robertson]], [[Phil Lynott]], [[Scott Gorham]] performing during the Bad Reputation Tour, 24 November 1977]]\n\nIn early 1975, Thin Lizzy toured the United States for the first time, in support of [[Bob Seger]] and [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]] (BTO). When BTO toured Europe later in the year to support their hit single \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", Thin Lizzy again accompanied them on what was a very high-profile tour.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=106}} They then recorded the ''[[Fighting (Thin Lizzy album)|Fighting]]'' album, which became the first Thin Lizzy album to chart in the UK, reaching No.&nbsp;60, although the singles still did not chart. Opening with Seger's \"[[Back in '72|Rosalie]]\", the album showed the first real evidence of the twin guitar sound that would lead the band towards their greatest successes, particularly with the dual harmonies of \"Wild One\" and both guitarists' soloing on \"Suicide\".{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=65}}\n\nAfter a successful multi-band tour in support of [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], the band recorded the album ''[[Jailbreak (album)|Jailbreak]]'', which proved to be their breakthrough record.

The twin guitar sound had been fully developed by this time and was in evidence throughout the album, particularly on the hit single, and other tracks such as \"Emerald\" and \"Warriors\". The album also charted well on both sides of the Atlantic, reaching No.&nbsp;10 in the UK and No.&nbsp;18 in the US, and the follow-up single, \"[[Jailbreak (Thin Lizzy song)|Jailbreak]]\", also performed well. Thin Lizzy toured the US in support of various bands such as [[Aerosmith]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[REO Speedwagon]], and they planned to tour there again in June 1976, this time with [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]]. However, Lynott fell ill with [[hepatitis]] and the tour was cancelled, which set them back a few months.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=74}}\n\nWhile Lynott was ill, he wrote most of the following album, ''[[Johnny the Fox]]''. The album was recorded in August 1976 and the sessions began to reveal tensions between Lynott and Robertson; for example, there was disagreement over the composition credits of the hit single \"Don't Believe a Word\".{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=120}} Lynott was still drawing on [[Celtic mythology]] and his own personal experiences for lyric ideas, which dominated ''Johnny the Fox'' and the other albums of Thin Lizzy's successful mid-1970s period.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=80}} The tour to support the album was very successful and there were further high-profile TV appearances, such as the ''[[Rod Stewart]] [[BBC]] TV Special''.{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=120}}\n\nAn important tour of the US in December 1976 had to be cancelled when Brian Robertson's hand was injured by a broken bottle during a fight at [[The Speakeasy Club]] in London, the night before the band were due to fly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/what-happened-the-night-brian-robertson-got-glassed-at-the-speakeasy|work=loudersound.com|title=What happened the night Brian Robertson got glassed at The Speakeasy|author=Johnny Black |date=30 August 2017}}</ref> Robertson maintains that, contrary to reports at the time, he was not drunk and had only gone to the venue for a meal.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=82}}{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=128}} Lynott was angry and replaced Robertson with Gary Moore for another tour of the States in January\u2013March 1977, this time supporting [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NmRaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT128|title=The Dead Straight Guide to Queen|author =Phil Chapman |page=128|publisher=This Day In Music Books|date= 1 Oct 2017|isbn=9781787590502}}</ref> The tour was a success and Lynott asked Moore to stay on, but he returned to his previous band, [[Colosseum II]].

Celtic influences remained, however, particularly in the album closer \"R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh\", a seven-minute medley of traditional Irish songs given a twin guitar rock veneer. Two singles, \"[[Waiting for an Alibi]]\" and \"[[Do Anything You Want To]]\", were successful, and the album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK.<ref name=\"UK\">{{cite web| url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=The Official Charts Company \u2013 Thin Lizzy |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=25 June 2008}}</ref> A third, moderately successful single, \"[[Sarah (Thin Lizzy song)|Sarah]]\" was Lynott's ode to his new-born daughter.{{sfn|Brooks|2000|p=83}}\n\nHowever, on 4 July 1979, after playing their [[Day on the Green]] set in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], Gary Moore abruptly left Thin Lizzy in the middle of another tour.

But I just had to leave.\"{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=184}} He subsequently pursued his solo career, releasing several successful albums. He had collaborated with Lynott and Downey on his 1978 album ''[[Back on the Streets (Gary Moore album)|Back on the Streets]]'' and the hit single \"[[Parisienne Walkways (song)|Parisienne Walkways]]\" before leaving Thin Lizzy, and in 1985 he and Lynott teamed up again on the UK No.&nbsp;5 single \"[[Out in the Fields (song)|Out in the Fields]]\".

Ure had prior plans to join [[Ultravox]], but had co-written a song, \"Get Out of Here\", with Lynott on ''Black Rose: A Rock Legend'', and agreed to help Thin Lizzy complete their touring commitments.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=112}} He also contributed guitar parts for ''[[The Continuing Saga of the Ageing Orphans]]'', a compilation album of remixed and overdubbed versions of Eric Bell-era tracks. On their return to the UK, the band were to headline the Reading Festival for the second time on 25 August 1979, but had to cancel due to the disruption within the line-up.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=113}}\n\nBefore a tour of Japan beginning in September, Lynott decided to bring in another guitarist, [[Dave Flett]], who had played with [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]], to enable Ure to switch to playing keyboards where necessary. The tour was completed successfully, but the line-up now contained two temporary members, and Lynott was spending a lot of time on projects outside Thin Lizzy, including composing and producing material for other bands, as well as putting together his first solo album, ''[[Solo in Soho]]''.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=202}} Lynott also reactivated The Greedy Bastards, who released a one-off Christmas single, \"A Merry Jingle\", in December 1979 as simply The Greedies.

Lynott got married on 14 February, and his wife gave birth to a second daughter in July.<ref name=\"lynott\">Philomena Lynott, \"My Boy: The Philip Lynott Story\", Virgin, 1995.</ref> Dave Flett had hoped to be made a permanent member of Thin Lizzy but Lynott chose [[Snowy White]], who had played with [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]].{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=115}} Midge Ure was still acting as a temporary keyboard player at gigs during early 1980, but was replaced by [[Darren Wharton]] in April, shortly after White joined the band. Wharton was only 18 at the time and was initially hired on a temporary basis.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=122}} This new line-up completed the ''Chinatown'' album between short tours, and two singles were released from it. The first, \"Chinatown\", reached No.&nbsp;21 in the UK, but the second, \"[[Killer on the Loose]]\", reached the top 10 amid much adverse publicity due to the ongoing activities of serial killer [[Peter Sutcliffe]], known as \"The Yorkshire Ripper\".{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=155}}\n\n[[File:Front Thin Lizzy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Phil Lynott plays bass guitar next to a guitarist|Thin Lizzy in concert, 1981]]\n''Chinatown'' was finally released in October 1980, and reached No.&nbsp;7 in the UK, but by this time Thin Lizzy albums were not even reaching the top 100 in the US. After a successful tour of Japan and Australia, the band undertook what was to be their final tour of the US in late 1980.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=131}}\nAt the beginning of 1981, Lynott began work on his second solo album, using Thin Lizzy members among a large group of backing musicians. Around the same time, the band were recording material for the next Thin Lizzy album, and as before, the sessions seemed to merge to the extent that musicians were not always sure which album they were working on. Producer for the Thin Lizzy sessions, [[Chris Tsangarides]], stated, \"The feeling of confusion was in the air in that sometimes nobody knew if they were working on a Phil solo record or a Lizzy album.\"{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=133}} Snowy White had previously felt that, as a member of Thin Lizzy, he should have been paid as a session player to appear on Lynott's solo recordings.{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=216}}\n\nIn April 1981, the band's first 'greatest hits' album was released, and ''[[The Adventures of Thin Lizzy]]'' reached No.&nbsp;6 in the UK, although a stand-alone single, \"Trouble Boys\", only reached No.&nbsp;53, the band's worst chart placing since 1975.{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=157}} According to White{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=134}} and Wharton,{{sfn|Putterford|1994|p=221}} Lynott was the only person who wanted to release it, and nobody else liked the song. \"Trouble Boys\" had even been pencilled in as the title for the new album, but the single's chart failure resulted in the song being dropped from the album and the title changed to ''[[Renegade (Thin Lizzy album)|Renegade]]''.{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=136}} One highlight for the band at this time was headlining the first-ever [[Slane Concert|Slane Castle]] concert on 16 August, with support from [[Kirsty MacColl]], [[Hazel O'Connor]] and [[U2]].{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=135}}\n\nLynott's second solo album, ''[[The Philip Lynott Album]]'', was delayed until 1982 while ''Renegade'' was completed and released in November 1981.

Downey was involved in a fight in a nightclub in Denmark in February,{{sfn|Byrne|2006|p=143}} and Gorham was suffering from drug-induced exhaustion.{{sfn|Bailie|1996|p=159}} Downey missed five concerts, and was replaced by [[Mark Nauseef]] again for three of them, and by Mike Mesbur of support band The Lookalikes for the other two.<ref name=\"Guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thinlizzyguide.com/tours/year/1982.htm |title=Thin Lizzy Tour 1982 |access-date=4 June 2012 |publisher=Thin Lizzy Guide}}</ref> In March, Gorham collapsed and returned home; eight concerts were performed as a quartet and six others were postponed.<ref name=\"Guide\" />\n\nLater in the year, Lynott went on a solo tour and released his second solo album, which did not sell particularly well. Snowy White left the band in August 1982, having tired of the disorganised schedules and Lynott's drug problems, although by his own admission he was too restrained and quiet to fit in well with his more raucous bandmates.<ref>Interview with Snowy White, [[BBC Radio 1]], \"The Friday Rock Show\", 8 January 1986.</ref> White went on to achieve top ten chart success in the UK with his single \"[[Bird of Paradise (Snowy White song)|Bird of Paradise]]\" in 1983.

Partway into the tour, many of Thin Lizzy's past guitarists were invited onstage to contribute to some of the songs they had originally recorded, the only exception being Snowy White. The album was released in October 1983 as ''[[Life (Thin Lizzy album)|Life]]'', which included an older performance of \"Renegade\" featuring White, and reached No.&nbsp;29 in the UK.{{sfn|Brooks|2000|p=115}} The tour continued while two more singles were released, the last of them, \"[[The Sun Goes Down (Thin Lizzy song)|The Sun Goes Down]]\", only reaching No.&nbsp;52 in August.

The fans seem to trust this line-up, and I don't blame them. We've kind of jumped this emotional hurdle together. Ricky's writing some fucking killer lyrics, and with the kind of talent that's in Thin Lizzy now I think we can pull off a really cool set of tunes.

Downey had decided to take a break from touring, and Wharton would be working on his own band [[Dare (band)|Dare]], and a film project. In March 2013, the band toured Australia under the Thin Lizzy name, with Downey and Wharton, as the opening act on a triple bill with [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. Gorham stressed that Thin Lizzy would still perform together occasionally: \"We'll still go out as Thin Lizzy. There are still certain big festivals that we will do. Thin Lizzy is still on the horizon, we will still go out and do that but in the meantime we have Black Star Riders that we are going to concentrate on also.\"<ref name=\"noise11.com\"/>\n\nOn 19 January 2016, the band revealed a \"half dozen or so\" dates in mid-2016 and early 2017 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the release of ''[[Jailbreak (album)|Jailbreak]]'' and the 30th anniversary of Lynott's death. Two festival dates were initially confirmed: the Ramblin' Man Fair in [[Maidstone, Kent]] on 23 July 2016 \u2013 at which Midge Ure once again joined them on stage \u2013 and the Rock Legends Cruise in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] on 19\u201323 January 2017.

This style was later refined and popularised in the mid-1970s by bands like Judas Priest, and later by the emerging [[new wave of British heavy metal]] groups such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Def Leppard]]. Iron Maiden covered the song \"Massacre\" from Thin Lizzy's ''[[Johnny the Fox]]'' album, and released it on their 1988 single \"[[Can I Play with Madness]]\". A cover of \"[[Cowboy Song (Thin Lizzy song)|Cowboy Song]]\" appears on ''[[Sound of White Noise]]'' (1993) by [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] as a bonus track on the album's Japanese and Australian releases, and as a B-side on some singles of \"[[Only (Anthrax song)|Only]]\" and \"[[Black and White Lodges#\"Black Lodge\" (song)|Black Lodge]]\".\n\nThin Lizzy are also a major
