Formed in 1992, they are fronted by vocalist [[Jay Kay]], and were prominent in the London-based funk and acid jazz movement of the 1990s. They built on their acid jazz sound in their early releases and later drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[disco]], [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Latin music]] genres. Lyrically, the group has addressed [[Social justice|social]] and [[environmental justice]]. Kay has remained as the only original member through several line-up changes.\n\nThe band made their debut under [[Acid Jazz Records]], but subsequently found mainstream success under [[Sony Music|Sony]]. While under this label, three of their albums have charted at number one in the UK, including ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999) and ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001). The band's 1998 single, \"[[Deeper Underground]]\", was also number one in their native country.\n\nAs of 2017, Jamiroquai had sold more than 26 million albums worldwide. Their third album, ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Record]] as the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for its lead single, \"[[Virtual Insanity]]\", also contributed to the band's success. The song was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]] and earned the band a [[40th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] in 1998.\n\n==History==\n\n=== 1992\u20131993: Formation and ''Emergency on Planet Earth''===\n[[File:Glastonbury93 Jamiroquai.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.6|Jamiroquai performing at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 1993]]\n[[Jay Kay]] was sending songs to record companies, including a [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] single released in 1986 under the label [[StreetSounds]].<ref name=\":20\">{{cite AV media|title=Emergency on Planet Earth|author=Kay, Jay|others=Jamiroquai|publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]]|year=2013|id=88691967852|type=liner notes}}</ref>{{sfn|Larkin|2011|page=1986}} During this time, Kay was influenced by Native American and [[First Nations in Canada|First Nation]] peoples and their philosophies; this led to the creation of \"[[When You Gonna Learn]]\", a song covering social issues.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> After he had it recorded, Kay fought with his producer, who took out half of the lyrics and produced the song based on what was charting at the time.<ref name=\":20\" /> With the track restored to his preference, the experience helped Kay realise he \"wanted a proper live band with a proper live sound\".<ref name=\":20\" /> The band would be named \"Jamiroquai\", a [[portmanteau]] of the words \"[[Jam session|jam]]\" and the name of a Native American confederacy, the [[Iroquois]].<ref name=\":15\">{{cite news |last=Selsman |first=Jill |title=New Again: Jamiroquai |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/new-again-jamiroquai |url-status=live |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |date=June 1993 |access-date=22 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201215080200/https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/new-again-jamiroquai |archive-date=15 December 2020 |language=en-US}}</ref> He was signed to [[Acid Jazz Records]] in 1991 after he sent a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] of himself covering a song by the [[the Brand New Heavies|Brand New Heavies]].<ref name=\":18\">{{cite news |last=Gates |first=Kenny |title=Major labels are all about politics.
