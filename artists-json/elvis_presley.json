The physician who delivered him wrote \"Elvis Aaron Presley\" in his ledger.{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} The state-issued birth certificate reads \"Elvis Aron Presley\". The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA Victor record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13\u201315}} In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, \"especially on legal documents\".{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's Outstanding Young Men used Aaron. Late in his life, he sought to officially change the spelling to Aaron and discovered that state records already listed it that way. Knowing his wishes for his middle name, Aaron is the spelling his father chose for Presley's tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as official.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13\u201315}}|name=name|group=lower-alpha}} (January 8, 1935 \u2013 August 16, 1977), or simply '''Elvis''', was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Rock and Roll]]\", he is regarded as [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century]]. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a [[civil rights movement|transformative era in race relations]], led him to both great success and [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley#Danger to American culture|initial controversy]].\n\nPresley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], and relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at [[Sun Records]] with producer [[Sam Phillips]], who wanted to bring the sound of [[African-American music]] to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill Black]], was a pioneer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. In 1955, drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA Victor single, \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of [[rock and roll]], though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African-Americans<ref name=\":00\"/> led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of the [[White Americans|White American]] youth.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=55}}\n\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. Drafted into [[Military career of Elvis Presley|military service in 1958]], Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of his most famous films included ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' (1957), ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' (1961), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964). In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his [[Graceland]] estate at the age of 42.\n\nHaving sold over 500 million records worldwide, Presley is recognized as the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling solo music artist of all time]] by ''[[Guinness World Records]].'' He was commercially successful in many genres, including [[Traditional pop|pop]], [[country music|country]], [[R&B|rhythm & blues]], [[adult contemporary]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. Presley won three [[Grammy Award]]s, received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at age 36, and has been inducted into [[List of halls of fame inducting Elvis Presley|multiple music halls of fame]]. He holds several records, including the most [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and the most number-one singles by any act on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== 1935\u20131953: Early years ===\n==== Childhood in Tupelo ====\n[[File:Elvis' birthplace Tupelo, MS 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Present-day photograph of a whitewashed house, about 15&nbsp;feet wide.

The visible side of the house, about 30&nbsp;feet long, has double-paned windows.|[[Elvis Presley Birthplace|Presley's birthplace]] in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]]]\nElvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], to Vernon Elvis (April 10, 1916 \u2013 June 26, 1979) and Gladys Love (''[[Birth name|n\u00e9e]]'' Smith; April 25, 1912 \u2013 August 14, 1958) Presley in a two-room [[shotgun house]] that his father built for the occasion.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=3}} Elvis's [[Twin|identical twin brother]], Jesse Garon Presley, was delivered 35 minutes before him, [[stillborn]].{{sfn|Earl|2017}} Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an [[Assembly of God]] church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12\u201314}}\n[[File:Historic Blue Moon Museum Verona MS 023.jpg|thumb|A photo of Elvis's parents at the Historic Blue Moon Museum in [[Verona, Mississippi|Verona]], [[Mississippi]]]]\nPresley's father, Vernon, was of [[Germany|German]],{{sfn|Kamphoefner|2009|p=33}} [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[England|English]] origins.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=60}} Presley's mother, Gladys, was [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] with some French Norman ancestry.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=13, 16, 20\u201322, 26}} His mother and the rest of the family believed that her great-great-grandmother, Morning Dove White, was [[Cherokee]].{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=301}}{{sfn|Nash|2005|pp=2, 188}}{{sfn|Keogh|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4leHQDbq6MEC&pg=PT233 222]}} This belief was restated by Elvis's granddaughter [[Riley Keough]] in 2017.{{sfn|Keough|2017}} [[Elaine Dundy]], in her biography, supports the belief.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=xv, 13, 16}} \n\nVernon moved from one [[Handyman|odd job]] to the next, showing little ambition.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=11\u201312, 23\u201324}}{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=419}} The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of [[Cheque fraud|altering a check]] written by his landowner and sometime-employer. He was jailed for eight months, while Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12\u201314}}\n\nIn September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as \"average\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=15\u201316}} He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of [[Red Foley]]'s [[country music|country]] song \"[[Old Shep]]\" during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi\u2013Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. The ten-year-old Presley stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang \"Old Shep\". He recalled placing fifth.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=17\u201318}} A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else\u2014by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=19}}{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=101}} Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, \"I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}\n\nIn September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade; he was regarded as a [[loner]]. The following year, he began bringing his guitar to school on a daily basis. He played and sang during lunchtime, and was often teased as a \"trashy\" kid who played [[hillbilly music]]. By then, the family was living in a largely black neighborhood.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=23\u201326}} Presley was a devotee of [[Mississippi Slim (country singer)|Mississippi Slim]]'s show on the Tupelo radio station [[WELO]]. He was described as \"crazy about music\" by Slim's younger brother, who was one of Presley's classmates and often took him into the station. Slim supplemented Presley's guitar instruction by demonstrating chord techniques.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=19\u201321}} When his ''[[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]]'' was twelve years old, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time, but succeeded in performing the following week.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n==== Teenage life in Memphis ====\nIn November 1948, the family moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. After residing for nearly a year in [[boarding house|rooming houses]], they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the [[Public housing in the United States|public housing]] complex known as the Lauderdale Courts.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=32\u201333}} Enrolled at [[Humes Preparatory Academy Middle School|L. C. Humes High School]], Presley received only a C in [[Music education|music]] in eighth grade. When his music teacher told him that he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his [[guitar]] the next day and sang a recent hit, \"Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me\", to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled that the teacher \"agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=36}} He was usually too [[Shyness|shy]] to perform openly, and was occasionally [[bullying|bullied]] by classmates who viewed him as a \"mama's boy\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=35\u201338}} \n\nIn 1950, he began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of [[Lee Denson]], a neighbor two and a half years his senior. They and three other boys\u2014including two future [[rockabilly]] pioneers, brothers [[Dorsey Burnette|Dorsey]] and [[Johnny Burnette]]\u2014formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=40\u201341}} That September, he began working as an usher at [[Providence Performing Arts Center|Loew's State Theater]].{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=20}} Other jobs followed at Precision Tool, Loew's again, and MARL Metal Products.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=43, 44, 49}} Presley also helped [[Jews|Jewish]] neighbors, the Fruchters, by being their [[shabbos goy]].\n\nDuring his junior year, Presley began to stand out more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew his [[sideburns]] and styled his hair with [[rose oil]] and [[Vaseline]]. In his free time, he would head down to [[Beale Street]], the heart of Memphis's thriving [[blues]] scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of [[Lansky Brothers]]. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humes' Annual \"Minstrel\" show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with \"[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]\", a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: \"I wasn't popular in school&nbsp;... I failed music\u2014only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show&nbsp;... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nPresley, who received no formal music training and could not [[Musical notation|read music]], studied and played by ear. He also frequented record stores that provided [[jukebox]]es and listening booths to customers. He knew all of [[Hank Snow]]'s songs,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}} and he loved records by other [[Country music|country singers]] such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Ted Daffan]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Jimmie Davis]], and [[Bob Wills]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} The [[Southern gospel]] singer [[Jake Hess]], one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his [[ballad]]-singing style.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=46\u201348, 358}}{{sfn|Wadey|2004}} He was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47\u201348, 77\u201378}} He adored the music of black gospel singer [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} \n\nLike some of his peers, he may have attended [[blues]] venues\u2014of necessity, in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated South]]\u2014only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=51}} He certainly listened to the regional radio stations, such as [[WDIA]]-AM, that played \"race records\": [[spirituals]], blues, and the modern, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-heavy sound of [[rhythm and blues]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=38\u201340}} Many of his future recordings were inspired by local [[African-American music|African-American musicians]] such as [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Rufus Thomas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=205}} [[B.B. King]] recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street.{{sfn|Szatmary|1996|p=35}} By the time he graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his future.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=54}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=8}}\n\n=== 1953\u20131956: First recordings ===\n\n==== Sam Phillips and Sun Records ====\n{{See also|List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley on the Sun label}}\n[[File:PresleyPromo1954PhotoOnly.jpg|alt=Elvis in a tuxedo|thumb|Presley in a [[Sun Records]] promotional photograph, 1954]]\nIn August 1953, Presley checked into the offices of [[Sun Studio|Memphis Recording Service]], the company run by [[Sam Phillips]] before he started [[Sun Records]]. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: \"[[My Happiness (popular song)|My Happiness]]\" and \"[[That's When Your Heartaches Begin]]\". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he \"sounded like\", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argued that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by [[receptionist]] [[Marion Keisker]] what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, \"I sing all kinds.\" When she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, \"I don't sound like nobody.\" After he recorded, Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: \"Good ballad singer. Hold.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=62\u201364}}\n\nIn January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun Records\u2014\"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\" and \"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\"\u2014but again nothing came of it.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=65}} Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows. He explained to his father, \"They told me I couldn't sing.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=77}} Songfellow [[Jim Hamill]] later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time.{{sfn|Cusic|1988|p=10}} In April, Presley began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=80}} His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a few local gigs with him, suggested he contact [[Eddie Bond]], leader of Smith's professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist. Bond rejected him after a tryout, advising Presley to stick to truck driving \"because you're never going to make it as a singer\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=83}}\n\nPhillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, \"Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'\"{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=72}} In June, he acquired a demo recording by [[Jimmy Sweeney]] of a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work something up with Presley for a recording session.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=10\u201311}}\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=That's All Right.ogg|title=\"That's All Right\" |description=Presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a \"lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence.\"{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=174}}}}\n\nThe session held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's \"[[That's All Right]]\". Moore recalled, \"All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open&nbsp;... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.{{' \"}} Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94\u201397}} \n\nThree days later, popular Memphis DJ [[Dewey Phillips]] played \"That's All Right\" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u2013101}} During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song, [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\", again in a distinctive style and employing a [[jury rigging|jury-rigged]] [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed \"slapback\". A single was pressed with \"That's All Right\" on the A-side and \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102\u2013104}}\n\n==== Early live performances and RCA Victor contract ====\nThe trio played publicly for the first time on July 17 at the Bon Air club\u2014Presley still sporting his child-size guitar.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=105, 139}} At the end of the month, they appeared at the [[Overton Park#Levitt Shell|Overton Park Shell]], with [[Slim Whitman]] headlining. Here Elvis pioneered '[[Rubber legs|Rubber Legs]]', his signature style dance movement that he is best known for.{{sfn|Miller|2021}}{{sfn|Rodman|2013|p=151}} A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 108\u2013111}} Moore recalled, \"During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}} Black, a natural showman, whooped and rode his bass, hitting double licks that Presley would later remember as \"really a wild sound, like a jungle drum or something\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}\n\nSoon after, Moore and Black left their old band, the Starlite Wranglers, to play with Presley regularly, and DJ/promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=117\u2013127, 131}} and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, \"His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=119}} Presley made what would be his only appearance on [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' stage on October 2; after a polite audience response, ''Opry'' manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was \"not bad\" but did not suit the program.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=128\u2013130}}{{sfn|Mason|2007|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n==== ''Louisiana Hayride'', radio commercial, and first television performances ====\nIn November 1954, Presley performed on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''\u2014the ''Opry''{{'}}s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. Presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=127\u2013128, 135\u2013142}} House drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] brought a new element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in [[strip club]]s.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|pp=61, 176}} Soon after the show, the ''Hayride'' engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] instrument for $175 ({{Inflation|US|175|1954|fmt=eq|r=-2}}), and his trio began playing in new locales, including [[Houston]], Texas and [[Texarkana, Arkansas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=152, 156, 182}}\n\nMany fledgling performers, like [[Minnie Pearl]], [[Johnny Horton]], and [[Johnny Cash]], sang the praises of ''Louisiana Hayride'' sponsor, [[Southern Maid Donuts]], including Presley, who developed a lifelong love of [[doughnut]]s.{{sfn|Everet|1977}} Presley made his singular product endorsement commercial for the doughnut company, which was never released, recording a radio [[jingle]], \"in exchange for a box of hot glazed doughnuts.\"{{sfn|Blazeski|2017}}{{sfn|Poch\u00e9|2017}}\n\nPresley made his first television appearance on the [[KSLA-TV]] television broadcast of ''Louisiana Hayride''. Soon after, he failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on the [[CBS]] television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular ''Hayride'' appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of [[Colonel Tom Parker]], whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Parker\u2014who claimed to be from West Virginia (he was actually Dutch)\u2014had acquired an honorary colonel's commission from country singer turned Louisiana governor [[Jimmie Davis]]. Having successfully managed top country star [[Eddy Arnold]], Parker was working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167\u2013168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6\u201312}} When the tour reached [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], Texas, a 19-year-old [[Roy Orbison]] saw Presley for the first time: \"His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing.&nbsp;... I just didn't know what to make of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}} By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to \"Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill\"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like \"That's All Right\", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the \"R&B idiom of negro field jazz\"; others, like \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", were \"more in the country field\", \"but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because \"he sounded too much like a hillbilly.\"{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=104}} The blend came to be known as [[rockabilly]]. At the time, Presley was variously billed as \"The King of Western Bop\", \"The Hillbilly Cat\", and \"The Memphis Flash\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=53}}\n\nPresley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=45}} The group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of the year.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=29}} Neal recalled, \"It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him. They'd get a gang and try to waylay him or something.\"{{sfn|Rogers|1982|p=41}} The trio became a quartet when ''Hayride'' drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]], whose \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=217\u2013119}}\n\nAt the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=31}} Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him. After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with [[RCA Victor]] on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}{{refn|Of the $40,000, $5,000 covered back royalties owed by Sun.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}|name=royalties|group=lower-alpha}} Presley, at 20, was still a minor, so his father signed the contract.{{sfn|Escott|1998|p=421}} Parker arranged with the owners of [[Hill & Range]] Publishing, [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley.

He received credit on two other songs to which he did contribute: he provided the title for \"[[That's Someone You Never Forget]]\" (1961), written by his friend and former Humes schoolmate [[Red West]]; Presley and West collaborated with another friend, guitarist Charlie Hodge, on \"[[You'll Be Gone]]\" (1962).{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=157\u2013158, 166, 168}}|name=cowriter|group=lower-alpha}} By December, RCA Victor had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=29}}\n\n=== 1956\u20131958: Commercial breakout and controversy ===\n\n==== First national TV appearances and debut album ====\n[[File:Elvis Presley LPM-1254 Album Cover.jpg|thumb|alt=Album cover with photograph of Presley singing\u2014head thrown back, eyes closed, mouth wide open\u2014and about to strike a chord on his acoustic guitar.

The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dorsey]]. After his first appearance, on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at the RCA Victor New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of [[Carl Perkins]]' rockabilly anthem \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\". In February, Presley's \"[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget]]\", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country chart]].{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=21}} Neal's contract was terminated, and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=50, 54, 64}}\n\nRCA Victor released Presley's [[Elvis Presley (album)|self-titled debut album]] on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety. There were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune. The others would centrally define the evolving sound of [[rock and roll]]: \"Blue Suede Shoes\"\u2014\"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way\", according to critic [[Robert Hilburn]]\u2014and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of [[Little Richard]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[The Drifters]]. As described by Hilburn, these \"were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists&nbsp;... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.\"{{sfn|Hilburn|2005}} It became the first rock and roll album to top the ''Billboard'' chart, a position it held for 10 weeks.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African-American rockers [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Chuck Berry]], cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, \"of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar&nbsp;... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.\"{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=28}}\n\n==== ''Milton Berle Show'' and \"Hound Dog\" ====\n[[File:Elvis signs autographs in Minneapolis 1956.jpg|thumb|left|Presley signing autographs in [[Minneapolis]] in 1956]]\n\nOn April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on NBC's ''[[The Milton Berle Show|Milton Berle Show]]''. His performance, on the deck of the [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|USS ''Hancock'']] in [[San Diego]], California, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=262\u2013263}} A few days later, a flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=267}} Twelve weeks after its original release, \"Heartbreak Hotel\" became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week [[concert residency|residency]] at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]].{{sfn|Koch |Manning |Toplikar |2008}} The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests\u2014\"like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party\", wrote a critic for ''[[Newsweek]].''{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=274}} Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]].{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}} He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, taking in 15 cities in as many days.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=72\u201373}} He had attended several shows by [[Freddie Bell and the Bellboys]] in Vegas and was struck by their cover of \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\", a hit in 1953 for blues singer [[Big Mama Thornton]] by songwriters [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]].

Edgar Hoover]]. It warned that \"Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States.&nbsp;... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth.&nbsp;... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium.&nbsp;... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls&nbsp;... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph.\"{{sfn|Fensch|2001|pp=14\u201318}}\n\nThe second ''Milton Berle Show'' appearance came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. Berle persuaded Presley to leave his guitar backstage, advising, \"Let 'em see you, son.\"{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of \"Hound Dog\" with a wave of his arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} Presley's gyrations created a storm of controversy.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=49}} Television critics were outraged: [[Jack Gould]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability.&nbsp;... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub.&nbsp;... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body&nbsp;... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway.\"{{sfn|Gould|1956}} Ben Gross of the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' opined that popular music \"has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley.&nbsp;... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis&nbsp;... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos\".{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}} [[Ed Sullivan]], whose own variety show was the nation's most popular, declared him \"unfit for family viewing\".{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as \"Elvis the Pelvis\", which he called \"one of the most childish expressions I ever heard, comin' from an adult.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=100}}\n\n==== ''Steve Allen Show'' and first Sullivan appearance ====\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Ed Sullivan October 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Photo of Elvis and Ed Sullivan|Ed Sullivan and Presley during rehearsals for his second appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', October 26, 1956]]\n\nThe Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's ''[[The Steve Allen Show|Steve Allen Show]]'' in New York. Allen, no fan of rock and roll, introduced a \"new Elvis\" in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang \"Hound Dog\" for less than a minute to a [[basset hound]] wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, \"Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd&nbsp;... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition\".{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=13}} Allen later wrote that he found Presley's \"strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing\" and simply worked him into the customary \"comedy fabric\" of his program.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=270}} Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, \"I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance.\"{{sfn|Rock 'N Roll Stars|1956|p=5}} Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=73}} Later that night, he appeared on ''[[Hy Gardner Calling]]'', a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, \"No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.&nbsp;... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.&nbsp;... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?\"{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}}\n\nThe next day, Presley recorded \"Hound Dog\", along with \"[[Any Way You Want Me (That's How I Will Be)|Any Way You Want Me]]\" and \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\". [[The Jordanaires]] sang harmony, as they had on ''The Steve Allen Show''; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which he announced, \"You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=51}} In August, a judge in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=80\u201381}} The single pairing \"Don't Be Cruel\" with \"Hound Dog\" ruled the top of the charts for 11 weeks\u2014a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years.{{sfn|Whitburn|1993|p=5}} Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood during the first week of September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", contributed \"[[Love Me (Leiber/Stoller song)|Love Me]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=60\u201365}}\n\nAllen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten CBS's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the ratings. Sullivan, despite his June pronouncement, booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers\u2014a record 82.6 percent of the television audience.{{sfn|Edgerton|2007|p=187}} Actor [[Charles Laughton]] hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} Presley appeared in two segments that night from [[CBS Television City]] in Los Angeles. According to Elvis legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows with his producer, Sullivan had opined that Presley \"got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants\u2014so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock.&nbsp;... I think it's a Coke bottle.&nbsp;... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!\"{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=93}} Sullivan publicly told ''[[TV Guide]]'', \"As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots.\"{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe in the first and second shows. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style: screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=338}}{{sfn|Gibson|2005}} Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}} More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' that made Presley a national celebrity of barely precedented proportions.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}}\n\nAccompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. Igniting the \"biggest pop craze since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]&nbsp;... Presley brought rock'n'roll into the mainstream of popular culture\", writes historian Marty Jezer. \"As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed.&nbsp;... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation\u2014the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.\"{{sfn|Jezer|1982|p=281}}\n\n==== Crazed crowds and film debut ====\n[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, March 1957 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Elvis performing on stage|Presley performing live at the Mississippi-Alabama Fairgrounds in Tupelo, September 26, 1956]]\n{{Listen|filename=Hound Dog & intro (live-Ed Sullivan 2).ogg|title=\"We're gonna do a sad song&nbsp;...\" |description=Presley's definition of rock and roll included a sense of humor\u2014here, during his second Sullivan appearance, he introduces one of his signature numbers.}}\nThe audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered.

The album includes \"Old Shep\", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA Victor session. According to Guralnick, one can hear \"in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=335}} Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from \"That's All Right\" through ''Elvis'', rock critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that \"these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=395}}\n\nPresley returned to the Sullivan show at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} His first motion picture, ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'', was released on November 21. Though he was not top-billed, the film's original title\u2014''[[Reno Gang|The Reno Brothers]]''\u2014was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: \"Love Me Tender\" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}} Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.{{sfn|O'Malley|2016}}\n\nOn December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records where Carl Perkins and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] were recording and had an impromptu [[jam session]] along with [[Johnny Cash]]. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for 25 years, became known as the \"[[Million Dollar Quartet]]\" recordings.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=71}} The year ended with a front-page story in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22&nbsp;million on top of his record sales,{{sfn|Palladino|1996|p=131}} and ''Billboard''{{'}}s declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=37}} In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, Presley had accounted for over 50 percent of the label's singles sales.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}}\n\n==== Leiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice ====\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| footer = Elvis in publicity photos for the 1957 film ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]''\n| image1 = Elvis Presley Jailhouse Rock2.jpg\n| width1 = 175\n| image2 = Elvis Presley Jailhouse Rock.jpg\n| width2 = 175\n| alt = Portrait photos of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II\n}}\nPresley made his third and final ''Ed Sullivan Show'' appearance on January 6, 1957\u2014on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist.

Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing [[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', with all stops out.\"{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, \"[[Peace in the Valley]]\". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley \"a real decent, fine boy\".{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=90}} Two days later, the Memphis [[Conscription in the United States|draft board]] announced that Presley would be [[class 1-A|classified 1-A]] and would probably be drafted sometime that year.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=95}}\n\nEach of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: \"[[Too Much (Elvis Presley song)|Too Much]]\", \"[[All Shook Up]]\", and \"[[(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear]]\".

The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', Presley's next film.

Also known as ''Welcome Home Elvis'', the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 fee for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=44, 62\u201363}}\n\n''[[G.I. Blues (album)|G.I.

It reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the UK, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows for a benefit event in Memphis, on behalf of 24 local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 114}} A 12-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, ''[[Something for Everybody]]''.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} As described by John Robertson, it exemplifies the [[Nashville sound]], the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley himself over the next half-decade, the album is largely \"a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright\".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=52}} It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, raising money for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] memorial, was staged on March 25, in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 119}}\n\n==== Lost in Hollywood ====\nParker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted musical comedies. Presley, at first, insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein\u2014''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)\u2014were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the 27 films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a \"pantheon of bad taste\".{{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. [[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine of them, declared, \"A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.\"{{sfn|Fields|2007}}\n\nOf Presley's films in the 1960s, 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules\u2014he frequently starred in three a year\u2014affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: \"three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew \"progressively worse\".{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'' (1966), says that he disliked many of the songs chosen for his films.{{sfn|Lisanti|2000|pp=19, 136}} The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how Presley would retreat from the studio microphone: \"The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]. But by and large, according to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be \"written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}} Regardless of the songs' quality, it has been argued that Presley generally sang them well, with commitment.{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=66}} Critic Dave Marsh heard the opposite: \"Presley isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like 'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and '[[Rock-A-Hula Baby]]'.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=395}}\n\nIn the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as \"[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]\" (1961) and \"[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]\" (1962). (\"[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]\", the title track to the 1964 film, was a minor hit as a B-side, and became truly popular only later). But, as with artistic merit, the commercial returns steadily diminished. During a five-year span\u20141964 through 1968\u2014Presley had only one top-ten hit: \"[[Crying in the Chapel]]\" (1965), a gospel number recorded back in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967). It won him his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was \"arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs\".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}\n\nShortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the [[Aladdin (hotel and casino)|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261\u2013263}} The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks rolled on. It was not until October 1967, when the [[Clambake (soundtrack)|''Clambake'' soundtrack LP]] registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA executives recognized a problem. \"By then, of course, the damage had been done\", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. \"Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans.\"{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=73}}\n\n=== 1968\u20131973: Comeback ===\n\n==== ''Elvis'': the '68 Comeback Special ====\n{{Main|Singer Presents...Elvis}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley 68 Comeback Special.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Presley, wearing a tight black leather jacket with Napoleonic standing collar, black leather wristbands, and black leather pants, holds a microphone with a long cord.

Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=4}}\n\nRecorded in late June in [[Burbank, California]], the special, simply called ''Elvis'', aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience\u2014Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer [[Steve Binder]] had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=293, 296}} The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} [[Jon Landau]] of ''Eye'' magazine remarked, \"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with envy.\"{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}} Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=649}}\n\nBy January 1969, the single \"[[If I Can Dream]]\", written for the special, reached number 12. The [[NBC-TV Special|soundtrack album]] rose into the top ten. According to friend [[Jerry Schilling]], the special reminded Presley of what \"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.&nbsp;... He was out of prison, man.\"{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, \"I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life.

Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Dave Marsh, it is \"a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=396}} The album featured the hit single \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart\u2014Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since \"Bossa Nova Baby\" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\", \"[[Don't Cry Daddy]]\", and \"[[Kentucky Rain]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=419}}\n\nPresley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the Comeback Special, offers came in from around the world. The [[London Palladium]] offered Parker {{US$|28,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|28000|1969|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for a one-week engagement. He responded, \"That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?\"{{sfn|Gordon|2005|p=146}} In May, the brand-new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, announced that it had booked Presley. He was scheduled to perform 57 shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist [[James Burton]] and including two gospel groups, [[The Imperials]] and [[Sweet Inspirations]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=283}} Costume designer [[Bill Belew]], responsible for the intense leather styling of the Comeback Special, created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by Presley's passion for karate.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=343}} Nonetheless, he was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker, who intended to make Presley's return the show business event of the year, oversaw a major promotional push. For his part, International Hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=346\u2013347}}\n\nPresley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (a song that would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=149\u2013150}} At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as \"The King\", Presley gestured toward [[Fats Domino]], who was taking in the scene. \"No,\" Presley said, \"that's the real king of rock and roll.\"{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=259, 262}} ''Newsweek'' commented, \"There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.\"{{sfn|Moyer|2002|p=73}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Presley \"supernatural, his own resurrection.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=287}} In November, Presley's final non-concert film, ''[[Change of Habit]]'', opened.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless {{US$|50,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|50000|1970|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=253}} The FBI took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows. Presley went onstage with a [[Derringer]] in his right boot and a .45 pistol in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=254}}{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=96}}\n\nThe album, ''[[That's the Way It Is (Elvis Presley album)|That's the Way It Is]]'', produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, \"The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop\u2014perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.\"{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=70}} After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the West Coast, followed in November.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=99}}\n\n[[File:Elvis-nixon (crop).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=A mutton-chopped Presley, wearing a long velour jacket and a giant buckle like that of a boxing championship belt, shakes hands with a balding man wearing a suit and tie.

He asked Nixon for a [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] badge, to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts.

Twice during the year, he overdosed on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. Towards the end of 1973, he was hospitalized, semi-comatose from the effects of a [[pethidine]] addiction. According to his [[primary care physician]], Dr. [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley \"felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street\".{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=238}} Despite his failing health, in 1974, he undertook another intensive touring schedule.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=481, 487, 499, 504, 519\u2013520}}\n\nPresley's condition declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] remembered Presley's arrival at a [[University of Maryland]] concert: \"He fell out of the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, 'Is the tour gonna happen'?\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=547}} Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, \"He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.&nbsp;...

After a session in December 1973 that produced 18 songs, enough for almost two albums, Presley made no official studio recordings in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=560}} Parker delivered RCA yet another concert record, ''[[Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis]]''.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=336}} Recorded on March 20, it included a version of \"[[How Great Thou Art]]\" that would win Presley his third and final [[Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance]] at [[17th Annual Grammy Awards|that year's Grammy Awards]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=381}}{{sfn|Grammy|2014}} All three of his competitive Grammy wins{{snd}}out of 14 total nominations{{snd}}were for gospel recordings.{{sfn|Grammy|2014}} Presley returned to the recording studio in Hollywood in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=584\u2013585}} In 1976, RCA sent a mobile recording unit to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions at Presley's home.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=593\u2013595}} Even in that comfortable context, the recording process had become a struggle for him.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=595}}\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Hurt (Presley).ogg|title=\"Hurt\" |description=An R&B hit for [[Roy Hamilton]] in 1955 and a pop hit for [[blue-eyed soul]] singer [[Timi Yuro]] in 1961, Presley's [[Southern soul|deep soul]] version was picked up by country radio in 1976.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=397}}}}\nDespite concerns from RCA and Parker, between July 1973 and October 1976, Presley recorded virtually the entire contents of six albums. Though he was no longer a major presence on the pop charts, five of those albums entered the top five of the [[Top Country Albums|country albums chart]], and three went to number one: ''[[Promised Land (Elvis Presley album)|Promised Land]]'' (1975), ''[[From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee]]'' (1976), and ''[[Moody Blue]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Caulfield|2004}} Similarly, his singles in this era did not prove to be major pop hits, but Presley remained a significant force in the country and adult contemporary markets. Eight studio singles from this period released during his lifetime were top ten hits on one or both charts, four in 1974 alone. \"[[My Boy]]\" was a [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|number-one adult contemporary hit]] in 1975, and \"[[Moody Blue (Elvis song)|Moody Blue]]\" topped the [[Hot Country Songs|country singles chart]] and reached the second spot on the adult contemporary chart in 1976.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}} Perhaps his most critically acclaimed recording of the era came that year, with what Greil Marcus described as his \"apocalyptic attack\" on the soul classic \"[[Hurt (Roy Hamilton song)|Hurt]]\".{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=284}} Dave Marsh wrote of Presley's performance: \"If he felt the way he sounded, the wonder isn't that he had only a year left to live but that he managed to survive that long.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=430}}\n\n==== Final months ====\nPresley and Linda Thompson split in November 1976, and he took up with a new girlfriend, Ginger Alden.{{sfn|Victor|2008|pp=8, 526}} He proposed to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later, though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again.{{sfn|Victor|2008|pp=8, 224, 325}} Journalist Tony Scherman wrote that by early 1977, \"Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self.

In the first, shot in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, \"is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=638}} Two days later, in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], \"he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too\", though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was \"framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=638}} Presley's final concert was held in [[Indianapolis]] at [[Market Square Arena]], on June 26, 1977.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=23}}\n\n[[File:Elvis burial site.jpg|thumb|alt=A long, ground-level gravestone reads \"Elvis Aaron Presley\", followed by the singer's dates, the names of his parents and daughter, and several paragraphs of smaller text.

Asked if drugs were involved, he declared that \"drugs played no role in Presley's death\".{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} In fact, \"drug use was heavily implicated\" in Presley's death, writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered \"anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy\". A pair of lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that [[polypharmacy]] was the primary cause of death; one reported \"fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=651\u2013653}} In 1979, forensic pathologist [[Cyril Wecht]] conducted a review of the reports and concluded that a combination of central nervous system depressants had resulted in Presley's accidental death.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Forensic historian and pathologist [[Michael Baden]] viewed the situation as complicated: \"Elvis had had an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call.\"{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}}\n\nThe competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was [[cardiac arrhythmia]], a condition that can be determined only in someone who is still alive; and denied drugs played any part in Presley's death before the toxicology results were known.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Allegations of a cover-up were widespread.{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}} While a 1981 trial of Presley's main physician, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], exonerated him of criminal liability for his death, the facts were startling: \"In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of sedatives, amphetamines, and narcotics: all in Elvis' name.\" His license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}\n\nIn 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as [[Miami-Dade County]] coroner,{{sfn|Tennant|2013|p=2}} declared at its completion, \"There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack.\"{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff \"could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then. That would be a matter of weeks.\" One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, \"could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached.&nbsp;... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body&nbsp;... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation.

Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} and, as Stoller put it, \"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\"{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}}\n\n=== Musicianship ===\nPresley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. While he couldn't read or write music and had no formal lessons, he was a natural musician and played everything by ear.{{sfn|Graceland Blog|2015}} Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA albums. He played electric bass guitar on \"[[(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care]]\" after his bassist [[Bill Black]] had trouble with the instrument.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p={{page needed|date=January 2021}}}} Presley played the bass line including the intro.

Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1989|p=104}}\n\nAt RCA Victor, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars{{sfn|Gillett|2000|p=113}} and a tougher, more intense manner.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=39}} While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard \"[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]\" at Sun Records to the country ballad \"How's the World Treating You?\" on his second RCA Victor LP to the blues of \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP ''[[Peace in the Valley (EP)|Peace in the Valley]]''. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=14}} Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Run On.ogg|title=\"Run On\" |description=From ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition.

His first post-Army single, the number-one hit \"Stuck on You\", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its \"mild rock beat\"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it \"upbeat pop\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The number five \"[[She's Not You]]\" (1962) \"integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop\".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966\u201367 recordings as \"[[Down in the Alley (The Clovers song)|Down in the Alley]]\" and \"[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213, 237}} Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", a number-one in 1960. \"It's Now or Never\", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song \"[['O sole mio]]\" and concluding with a \"full-voiced operatic cadence\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\nWhile Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become \"hard to find\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was \"Burning Love\", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]. Much of ''Elvis in Memphis'', as well as \"Suspicious Minds\", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}\n\n=== Vocal style and range ===\nThe developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from \"high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=234}} Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the \"vocal stutter\" on 1955's \"[[Baby Let's Play House]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=317}} When on \"Don't Be Cruel\", Presley \"slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses,\" he shows \"how masterful his relaxed style really is.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=91}} Marsh describes the vocal performance on \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" as one of \"gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing\", with the line {{\"'}}Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=490}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley first national television appearance 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Publicity photo of Elvis playing guitar|Publicity photo for the CBS program ''Stage Show'', January 16, 1956]]\nJorgensen calls the 1966 recording of \"How Great Thou Art\" \"an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions\", as Presley \"crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax\", becoming \"a kind of one-man quartet\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=212}} Guralnick finds \"[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand By Me]]\" from the same gospel sessions \"a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance,\" but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on \"Where No One Stands Alone\", resorting \"to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound\" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, \"he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=232}} Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: \"The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=231}}\n\nMarsh praises his 1968 reading of \"[[U.S. Male]]\", \"bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=424}} The performance on \"In the Ghetto\" is, according to Jorgensen, \"devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms\", instead relying on the exceptional \"clarity and sensitivity of his voice\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=271}} Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of \"almost translucent eloquence&nbsp;... so quietly confident in its simplicity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=332}} On \"Suspicious Minds\", Guralnick hears essentially the same \"remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise\", but supplemented with \"an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}\n\nMusic critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that \"Presley has been described variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]]. An extraordinary compass&nbsp;... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, \"from the baritone low [[G (musical note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} In Pleasants' view, his voice was \"variable and unpredictable\" at the bottom, \"often brilliant\" at the top, with the capacity for \"full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|As]] that an opera baritone might envy\".{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that \"his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all.\"{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always \"able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers\", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}\n\n== Public image ==\n\n=== Relationship with the African-American community ===\nWhen Dewey Phillips first aired \"That's All Right\" on Memphis' [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]], many listeners who contacted the station by phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u2013101}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]\u2014the originator of \"That's All Right\"\u2014\"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley, \"the rock 'n' roll phenomenon\", \"cracked Memphis' segregation laws\" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its \"colored night\".{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} In contrast, many white adults \"did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.\"<ref name=\":00\"/>\n\nDespite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had at some point announced, \"The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes.\" A journalist with the national African-American weekly ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'', Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of ''[[Jailhouse Rock (1957 film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: \"I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like [[Fats Domino]] can. I know that.\"{{sfn|Williams|2012}} Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Blues singer [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, \"He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=426}} Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}} The identification of Presley with racism\u2014either personally or symbolically\u2014was expressed in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit \"[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]\", by [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]: \"Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain / Motherfuck him and [[John Wayne]]\".{{sfn|Myrie|2009|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\nThe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.{{Example needed|date=June 2020}}{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}{{sfn|Myrie|2009|pp=123\u2013124}} Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was [[Jackie Wilson]], who argued, \"A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis.\"{{sfn|Masley|2002}} Moreover, Presley also acknowledged his debt to African-American musicians throughout his career. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [that].\"{{sfn|Osborne|2000|p=207}} Nine years earlier, he had said, \"Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years.

And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\"{{sfn|Ashley|2009|p=76}} His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic [[George Melly]] described him as \"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=58}} In his Presley obituary, [[Lester Bangs]] credited him as \"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|pp=58\u201359}} Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.{{sfn|Garber|1997|p=366}}\n\nWhile Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, ''[[Sight and Sound]]''{{'}}s Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \"aggressively bisexual in appeal\".{{Sfn|Dyer|1959\u20131960|p=30}} Brett Farmer places the \"orgasmic gyrations\" of the title dance sequence in ''Jailhouse Rock'' within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\".{{sfn|Farmer|2000|p=86}} In the analysis of [[Yvonne Tasker]], \"Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\"{{sfn|Tasker|2007|p=208}}\n\nReinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from [[Natalie Wood]] in the 1950s to [[Connie Stevens]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1960s to [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Cybill Shepherd]] in the 1970s. [[June Juanico]] of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.{{sfn|Stein|1997}} Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=109}}\n\n=== Equestrian ===\nElvis kept several horses at [[Graceland]], and horses remain important to the Graceland estate. A local former teacher, Alene Alexander, has taken care of the horses at Graceland for 38 years. She and [[Priscilla Presley]] have a love for horses and have formed a special friendship. It was because of Priscilla that Elvis brought horses to Graceland. \"He got me my first horse as a Christmas present&nbsp;\u2013 Domino,\" said Priscilla Presley. Alexander now serves as Graceland's Ambassador. She is one of three of the original staff members still working at the estate.{{sfn|Moncrease|2020}}\n\nThe horse named Palomino Rising Sun was Elvis' favorite horse, and there are many photographs of him riding him.{{sfn|Altieri|2017}}\n\n== Associates ==\n=== Colonel Parker and the Aberbachs ===\n{{further|Colonel Tom Parker}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker 1969.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Photo of Elvis and Colonel Tom Parker|Presley and Colonel Tom Parker, 1969]]\nOnce he became Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker insisted on exceptionally tight control over his client's career. Early on, he and his Hill and Range allies, the brothers [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], perceived the close relationship that developed between Presley and songwriters [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]] as a serious threat to that control.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=415\u2013417, 448\u2013449}} Parker effectively ended the relationship, deliberately or not, with the new contract he sent Leiber in early 1958. Leiber thought there was a mistake\u2014the sheet of paper was blank except for Parker's signature and a line on which to enter his. \"There's no mistake, boy, just sign it and return it\", Parker directed. \"Don't worry, we'll fill it in later.\" Leiber declined, and Presley's fruitful collaboration with the writing team was over.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=452\u2013453}} Other respected songwriters lost interest in or simply avoided writing for Presley because of the requirement that they surrender a third of their usual royalties.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=198}}\n\nBy 1967, Parker's contracts gave him 50 percent of most of Presley's earnings from recordings, films, and merchandise.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=248}} Beginning in February 1972, he took a third of the profit from live appearances;{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=304, 365}} a January 1976 agreement entitled him to half of that as well.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=358, 375}} Priscilla Presley noted that \"Elvis detested the business side of his career. He would sign a contract without even reading it.\"{{sfn|Presley|1985|p=188}} Presley's friend Marty Lacker regarded Parker as a \"hustler and a con artist. He was only interested in 'now money'\u2014get the buck and get gone.\"{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=290}} Priscilla Presley said after Parker's death, however, that Elvis was happy to pay 50% to Parker to manage him.{{sfn|Dowd|2022}}\n\nLacker was instrumental in convincing Presley to record with Memphis producer [[Chips Moman]] and his handpicked musicians at American Sound Studio in early 1969. The American Sound sessions represented a significant departure from the control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still had to deal with the publisher's staff on-site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He was on the verge of quitting until Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio.{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|pp=262\u2013265}} Although RCA executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the recordings,{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=267}} Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=281}}\n\nThroughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States\u2014all of them in Canada, during brief tours there in 1957.{{sfn|Nash|2003|p=186}} In 1968, he remarked, \"Before too long I'm going to make some personal appearance tours. I'll probably start out here in this country and after that, play some concerts abroad, probably starting in Europe. I want to see some places I've never seen before.\"{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}} Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his evident unwillingness to apply for a passport.{{sfn|Nash|2003|p=187}} After Presley's death, it was revealed that Parker was born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk in the Netherlands; having immigrated illegally to the U.S., he had reason to fear that if he left the country, he would not be allowed back in again.{{sfn|Nash|2005|pp=64, 478}} Parker ultimately squelched any notions Presley had of working abroad, claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=123}}\n\nParker arguably exercised tightest control over Presley's film career. Hal Wallis said, \"I'd rather try and close a deal with the devil\" than with Parker. Fellow film producer [[Sam Katzman]] described him as \"the biggest con artist in the world\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=192}} In 1957, [[Robert Mitchum]] asked Presley to costar with him in ''[[Thunder Road (1958 film)|Thunder Road]]'', which Mitchum was producing and writing.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=125}} According to George Klein, one of his oldest friends, Presley was also offered starring roles in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''.{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=226}} In 1974, [[Barbra Streisand]] approached Presley to star with her in the remake of ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]]''.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=563\u2013565}} In each case, any ambitions Presley may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager's negotiating demands or flat refusals. In Lacker's description, \"The only thing that kept Elvis going after the early years was a new challenge. But Parker kept running everything into the ground.\"{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=290}} The prevailing attitude may have been summed up best by the response Leiber and Stoller received when they brought a serious film project for Presley to Parker and the Hill and Range owners for their consideration. In Leiber's telling, Jean Aberbach warned them to never again \"try to interfere with the business or artistic workings of the process known as Elvis Presley\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}}\n\n=== Memphis Mafia ===\n{{Main|Memphis Mafia}}\nIn the early 1960s, the circle of friends with whom Presley constantly surrounded himself until his death came to be known as the \"Memphis Mafia\".{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|pp=139\u2013140}} \"Surrounded by the[ir] parasitic presence\", as journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] puts it, \"it was no wonder that as he slid into addiction and torpor, no-one raised the alarm: to them, Elvis was the bank, and it had to remain open.\"{{sfn|Harris|2006}} [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], who played piano for Presley regularly in the last two years of Presley's life, observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address it: \"But we all knew it was hopeless because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people&nbsp;... all those so-called friends\".{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=339}} In the Memphis Mafia's defense, Marty Lacker has said, \"[Presley] was his own man.&nbsp;... If we hadn't been around, he would have been dead a lot earlier.\"{{sfn|Connelly|2008|p=148}}\n\n[[Larry Geller]] became Presley's hairdresser in 1964. Unlike others in the Memphis Mafia, he was interested in spiritual questions and recalls how, from their first conversation, Presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties: \"I mean there ''has'' to be a purpose&nbsp;... there's got to be a reason&nbsp;... why I was chosen to be Elvis Presley.&nbsp;... I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really feel.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=174}} Thereafter, Geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism, which Presley read voraciously.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=175}} Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books on tour.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{further|Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|Cultural depictions of Elvis Presley|Elvis has left the building|List of songs about or referencing Elvis Presley}}\n\n{{quote box\n|quote=I know he invented rock and roll, in a manner of speaking, but&nbsp;... that's not why he's worshiped as a god today.

Elvis Presley}}\n\nA vast number of recordings have been issued under Presley's name. The total number of his original master recordings has been variously calculated as 665{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=438}} and 711.{{sfn|Feeney|2010}} His career began and he was most successful during an era when singles were the primary commercial medium for pop music. In the case of his albums, the distinction between \"official\" studio records and other forms is often blurred. For most of the 1960s, his recording career focused on soundtrack albums. In the 1970s, his most heavily promoted and bestselling LP releases tended to be concert albums.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Studio albums'''\n* ''[[Elvis Presley (album)|Elvis Presley]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[Elvis (1956 album)|Elvis]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[Elvis' Christmas Album]]'' (1957)\n* ''[[Elvis Is Back!]]'' (1960)\n* ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'' (1960)\n* ''[[Something for Everybody]]'' (1961)\n* ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' (1962)\n* ''[[Elvis for Everyone!]]'' (1965)\n* ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[From Memphis to Vegas / From Vegas to Memphis]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[That's the Way It Is (Elvis Presley album)|That's the Way It Is]]'' (1970)\n* ''[[Elvis Country (I'm 10,000 Years Old)]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[Love Letters from Elvis]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[Elvis sings The Wonderful World of Christmas]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[Elvis Now]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[He Touched Me (album)|He Touched Me]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Elvis (1973 album)|Elvis]]'' (1973) <small>(The \"Fool\" Album)</small>\n* ''[[Raised on Rock / For Ol' Times Sake]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Good Times (Elvis Presley album)|Good Times]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Promised Land (Elvis Presley album)|Promised Land]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Today (Elvis Presley album)|Today]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[Moody Blue]]'' (1977)\n{{col-2}}\n'''Soundtrack albums (original material)'''\n* ''[[Loving You (soundtrack)|Loving You]]'' (1957)\n* ''[[King Creole (soundtrack)|King Creole]]'' (1958)\n* ''[[G.I.
