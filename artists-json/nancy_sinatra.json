She is the elder daughter of [[Frank Sinatra]] and Nancy Sinatra ({{n\u00e9e}} Barbato), and is best known for her 1966 [[signature song|signature hit]] \"[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]{{-\"}}.\n\nNancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in November 1957 with an appearance on her father's ABC-TV variety series, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] number-one hit with \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin{{'\"}}. A TV promo clip from the era features Sinatra in high boots, accompanied by colorfully dressed [[Go-go dancing|go-go dancers]], in what is now considered an iconic [[Swinging Sixties]] look.<ref name=KLSmith/><ref name=SLeigh/> The song was written by [[Lee Hazlewood]], who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets. As with all of Sinatra's 1960s hits, \"Boots\" featured [[Billy Strange]] as arranger and conductor.\n\nBetween early 1966 and early 1968, Sinatra charted on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'''s Hot 100]] with 14 titles, ten of which reached the Top 40. In addition to \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin{{'\"}}, defining recordings during this period include \"[[Sugar Town]]\", \"Love Eyes\", the transatlantic 1967 number one \"[[Somethin' Stupid]]\" (a duet with her father), two versions of [[You Only Live Twice (song)|the title song]] from the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967), several collaborations with [[Lee Hazlewood]] \u2013 including \"[[Summer Wine]]\", \"[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]\", \"Lady Bird\" and \"[[Some Velvet Morning]]\" \u2013 and a non-single 1966 cover of the [[Cher]] hit \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]\", which features in the opening credits of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 2003 film ''[[Kill Bill Volume 1]]''. In 1971 Sinatra and Hazlewood achieved their first collaborative success in the UK singles chart with the no. 2 hit \"Did You Ever?\", and the 2005 UK no. 3 hit by [[Audio Bullys]], \"[[Shot You Down]]\", sampled Sinatra's version of \"Bang Bang\".\n\nBetween 1964 and 1968 Sinatra appeared in several feature films, co-starring with [[Peter Fonda]] in [[Roger Corman]]'s biker-gang movie ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' (1966) and alongside [[Elvis Presley]] in the musical drama ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' (1968).
