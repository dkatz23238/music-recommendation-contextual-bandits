The band released ten studio albums, with its most recent and final one, ''[[Yellowcard (album)|Yellowcard]]'', released on September 30, 2016. Following this release and supporting tour, the band broke up. The band reunited in September 2022 for a performance at Riot Fest, though no official reformation plans have yet been revealed.\n\n==History==\n===Early years and first three albums (1997\u20132002)===\nYellowcard was formed in 1997 in Jacksonville, Florida, after its members met at [[Douglas Anderson School of the Arts]]. The band got its name from a phrase its members used in high school: whenever somebody did something stupid at a party, such as spilling beer on the carpet, they cited [[Association football|soccer]] laws and gave the offender a \"[[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]]\" for committing a \"party foul\".\n\nYellowcard's original lineup featured Ben Dobson on vocals, Todd Clary on guitar and vocals, Ben Harper on guitar, Warren Cooke on bass, and [[Longineu W. Parsons III|Longineu Parsons III]] on drums. Modern Amusement frontman [[Ryan Key]] appeared as a guest, on background vocals, as did violinist Sean Mackin. Key had also been in California band [[Craig's Brother]].\n\nYellowcard recorded their first LP, ''Midget Tossing'', at the Music Factory in [[Jacksonville Beach, Florida|Jacksonville Beach]] with Michael Ray FitzGerald at the board. ''[[Where We Stand]]'', the band's debut studio album, featured the same lineup as ''Midget Tossing'', and Mackin was brought in for more songs. Soon, however, the band fired Dobson and replaced him with former guest vocalist Key. This changed the band's style from [[hardcore punk]] to [[pop punk]].\n\nIn early 2000, Yellowcard recorded the ''Still Standing'' EP. Soon after it was released, Todd Clary left the band. Key then filled both Clary's and Dobson's duties, guitar and vocals respectively. After sending the new EP to friend Steve Lubarsky at Lobster Records, the band signed its first recording contract in June 2000 and in November, headed west to [[Camarillo, California]], to begin working on another full-length album. The group released its third album, ''[[One for the Kids]]'' ([[Lobster Records]]), in 2001 and followed up with ''The Underdog EP'' ([[Fueled by Ramen]] Records) in 2002. Both of these were well received by fans. However, soon after ''The Underdog EP'' was released, Warren Cooke left for personal reasons on July 16, 2002.<ref name=\"Oxford Music Online\">{{cite book|title=\"Yellowcard.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music |edition=4th|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> The band then asked [[Pete Mosely]] from [[Inspection 12]] to play bass, and he joined the band four days later.\n\n===''Ocean Avenue'' (2003\u20132005)===\nShortly after releasing ''The Underdog EP'', Yellowcard signed with [[Capitol Records]].<ref>[http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=725]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref>  The group recorded their major-label debut ''[[Ocean Avenue (album)|Ocean Avenue]]'' in February\u2013March 2003 and released on July 22, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author=MacKenzie Wilson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ocean-avenue-mw0000037522 |title=Ocean Avenue \u2013 Yellowcard &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2003-07-22 |access-date=2016-11-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912041845/http://www.allmusic.com/album/ocean-avenue-mw0000037522 |archive-date=2016-09-12 }}</ref>  During the recording of the album, Mosely left Yellowcard, devoting his time to his first band, Inspection 12, and finishing the band's album, ''[[Get Rad]]''. The members of Yellowcard began the search for a new bass player and chose [[Alex Lewis (musician)|Alex Lewis]], whose sister, Alieke Wijnveldt, contributed vocals to the ''Ocean Avenue'' track \"View from Heaven\". After Lewis joined, the band filmed an unreleased music video for the song \"Powder\". The video was later put on the enhanced version of ''[[Ocean Avenue (album)|Ocean Avenue]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAdRBwog7O0|title=YouTube \u2013 Yellowcard \u2013 Powder(Official Music Video)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 25, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207041931/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAdRBwog7O0|archive-date=December 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nYellowcard released its first single from ''Ocean Avenue'', \"[[Way Away]]\". The song did well on [[MTV2]] and rock radio, peaking at No. 25 on the modern-rock charts. The song created enough buzz to cause the band's mainstream explosion. In the middle of the band's first headlining tour, Peter Mosely decided to leave Inspection 12 and asked if he could rejoin Yellowcard. Because Mosely had been an integral part of the writing for ''Ocean Avenue'' and had also been friends with most of the band's members since high school, Lewis was asked to leave on March 1, 2004, and Mosely was reinstated as the bass player.\n\nIn late 2003, Yellowcard finally broke through with a hit single, \"[[Ocean Avenue (song)|Ocean Avenue]]\", in part due to the song premiering on [[MTV]]'s [[Total Request Live|TRL]] program. Radio eventually picked up on the single, with it peaking at No. 37 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] during the summer of 2004. The band experienced its peak popularity during the second half of 2004.  They were cover features on ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' magazine, a headliner of the 2004 [[Warped Tour]], performed \"Ocean Avenue\" and won the MTV2 award at the [[2004 MTV Video Music Awards]], and were featured in the season 2 premiere of ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' with their song \"Empty Apartment\". The band was featured episode 3 in season 8 of MTV's [[The Challenge (TV series)|Real World/Road Rules Challenge]] (later abridged to \"The Challenge\"), performing \"Way Away\" while cast members trashed a mock hotel room for a \"rock star redecoration\" challenge. The album's first track, \"Way Away\", appeared on the soundtracks of ''[[SSX 3]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL 2004]]''. The album's second track, \"Breathing\", also appeared in [[Electronic Arts|EA]]'s ''[[Burnout 3: Takedown]]'' and ''[[FlatOut 2]]''. Following \"Ocean Avenue\"'s success, the band released the single \"[[Only One (Yellowcard song)|Only One]]\", a rock ballad which also did fairly well on TRL and radio. The ''Ocean Avenue'' album sold over one million copies in the U.S. alone.\n\nAs ''Ocean Avenue'''s popularity began to decrease, Yellowcard spent some time contributing songs to various other soundtracks. The first, \"Gifts and Curses\", appeared in the hit film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. Another, a cover of [[Lagwagon]]'s \"Violins\", was featured on ''[[Rock Against Bush, Vol. 2]]'' compilation album. At the [[2005 MTV Movie Awards]], Yellowcard performed a cover of the song \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\" during a special tribute to the movie ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''.\n\nOn August 13, 2013, an acoustic version of ''Ocean Avenue'' was released in honor of the album's 10th anniversary.<ref>[http://yellowcardrock.com/post/52062419072/ocean-avenue-acoustic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623024048/http://yellowcardrock.com/post/52062419072/ocean-avenue-acoustic|date=June 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===''Lights and Sounds'' (2005\u20132006)===\nAfter almost two years of touring, Yellowcard took a few months off at the beginning of 2005. Ryan Key and Peter Mosely moved to New York City to write the songs for the group's next album. The rest of the band remained in Los Angeles. The band regrouped in LA in the spring and began pre-production for the follow-up to ''[[Ocean Avenue (album)|Ocean Avenue]]'' in March. Recording and production was finished in September, and advertising began for the album. The band had originally announced that the album was expected for August 2005, but production and other delays pushed the release date back several months.\n\nIn the months following, many problems had arisen between the bandmates. Ryan Key has made many comments since then stating, \"The fame went to our heads.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} After months of increasing tension stemming from Ben Harper's increased involvement with his indie label Takeover Records, Harper was removed from Yellowcard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1513142/yellowcard-confirm-what-fans-already-knew-ben-harper-is-out/|title=Yellowcard Confirm What Fans Already Knew: Ben Harper Is Out|publisher=MTV|access-date=2016-11-04|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701201853/http://www.mtv.com/news/1513142/yellowcard-confirm-what-fans-already-knew-ben-harper-is-out/|archive-date=2017-07-01}}</ref><ref>[http://www.punkbands.com/news/6374/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701092453/http://www.punkbands.com/news/6374/|date=July 1, 2009}}</ref> He was replaced by Ryan Mendez from the band Staring Back. After leaving Yellowcard, Harper joined [[Amber Pacific]] as a touring guitarist. Harper left the band when the group returned to the studio, with Rick Hanson assuming the permanent guitarist role.<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Amber Pacific\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> Harper is now in the band [[HeyMike!]] and runs [[Takeover Records (California)|Takeover Records]] in [[California]].\n\n''[[Lights and Sounds]]'' was finally released on January 24, 2006. A loose concept album, the theme centers around Yellowcard's negative feelings towards Los Angeles. Prior to the release of ''Lights and Sounds'' Ryan Key said that this ambitious album would probably alienate a large portion of the group's fan base, and that he was \"100 percent okay with that.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1535200/yellowcard-think-twice-about-ambitious-lp.jhtml |title=Yellowcard on Ambitious Lights and Sounds: 'We All Went A Bit Too Far' \u2013 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2006-06-27 |access-date=2011-11-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026035451/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1535200/yellowcard-think-twice-about-ambitious-lp.jhtml |archive-date=2012-10-26 }}</ref> 20 songs were recorded for the album, 14 of which are on the CD, plus a [[B-side]] available on import versions, CD singles, and at the [[iTunes Store]], called \"Three Flights Down\". The opening track, \"Three Flights Up\", was the first instrumental track on a Yellowcard album since \"Interlewd\" on the band's first album, ''Midget Tossing''. Those two and \"Convocation\" from their 2014 release, ''[[Lift a Sail]]'', are the only instrumental tracks the band has released on an album.\n\nThe title track, \"[[Lights and Sounds (song)|Lights and Sounds]]\", was the first single, released a week before the album. It peaked at No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks]]. It is also featured on the video games ''[[Burnout Revenge]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Modern Hits]]''. In its first week of release, the album sold just over 90,000 copies, but it only went on to receive gold status. High first week sales are most likely the result of high anticipation of the album, as it was the follow-up to the highly successful ''Ocean Avenue''; low total sales backup Key's statement about the album being very ambitious and different in sound from ''Ocean Avenue''. On May 6, 2006, the second and final single and video of the album, \"[[Rough Landing, Holly]]\", was released. The single was not as well received as the first, and after its first week of release, it quickly dropped on the charts.\n\nIn May 2006, Ryan Key had surgery on his vocal chords after having problems with his singing. He had started having problems in December 2005. He was mute for a week and could not sing for more than a month. Yellowcard, after canceling some shows and receiving some time off from touring, joined the Virgin Mega Tour for the summer of 2006.\n\n===''Paper Walls'' (2006\u20132008)===\nOn October 16, 2006, Yellowcard announced via its website that the group was back in the studio recording a new album. Guitarist Ryan Mendez posted on the official Yellowcard message board on October 21, 2006, that three songs had been completed and stated, \"I really think fans of both older and newer Yellowcard are going to be very happy.\" Pre-production began in October 2006, and tracking began in January 2007. Between the months of January and March 2007, studio footage labeled \"Yellowcard Sessions\" regarding the band's progress on making the album was posted on their [[Myspace]], with a new video added every Thursday. In total, 10 videos were posted, with additional footage released on the deluxe CD/DVD edition of ''[[Paper Walls]]''. Additionally, in January 2007, some sample demo songs were released on the band's MySpace, though they were only rough recordings from pre-production and not the final recorded versions. The first demo was a 30-second preview of the iTunes bonus track, \"Bombers\", and the second was a clip of an unmixed version of \"[[Light Up the Sky (Yellowcard song)|Light Up the Sky]]\".\n\nThe first Yellowcard show since October 2006 took place on March 29, 2007, at the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood, California]].  At the show, lead singer Ryan Key announced to a sold-out crowd that the new album would be titled ''Paper Walls''. He said he would \"probably get in trouble for [it]\", but went on to announce the title anyway; Key also announced the album title during a concert at [[Southern Connecticut State University]]. During the Troubadour show, the group played two songs from its new album (\"[[Fighting (Yellowcard song)|Fighting]]\" and \"The Takedown\"). Yellowcard played an acoustic set the next night at the Troubadour and premiered two new songs, \"Shadows and Regrets\" and \"[[Light Up the Sky (Yellowcard song)|Light Up the Sky]]\".\n\nIn the teaser of an interview with Jason Tate of absolutepunk.net<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=245718 |title=Yellowcard Teaser Interview \u2013 News Article \u2013 |publisher=Absolutepunk.net |access-date=2011-07-18}}</ref> released on June 17 (one month before the release of the album), Key described the album as\n\n<blockquote> ... very much a record of hope and finding yourself again. It's after you've come through all of that \u2013 going to the height of it \u2013 and picking yourself back up again. And by \"hitting rock bottom\", I don't mean in record sales or fame or any of that shit. I mean personally \u2013 emotionally ... Paper Walls is the story, the feeling, of what it's like to be out of those holes, looking back, no regrets, but smarter and having grown through them.</blockquote>\n\nThe whole interview was released on July 17, the release date of the album.\n\nYellowcard announced on May 15 via Myspace that the first single from ''Paper Walls'' would be \"[[Light Up the Sky (Yellowcard song)|Light Up the Sky]]\". This song was released to iTunes and radio on June 5. Soon after its release, ''Paper Walls'' became the second most popular album on iTunes and the most popular album in the alternative section. On July 9, Yellowcard released ''Paper Walls'' on the group's Myspace music player to give fans a taste of what was to come on the new album. ''Paper Walls'' was released in the U.S. on July 17 (July 16 on iTunes) in an additional CD/DVD format, as ''[[Lights and Sounds]]'' was the previous year. The DVD contains exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the band, an extensive photo gallery and two additional live bonus tracks.<ref>[http://www.yellowcardbr.com/news_eng.php Yellowcardbr.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226212034/http://www.yellowcardbr.com/news_eng.php |date=December 26, 2014 }}</ref> In June 2007, Yellowcard was voted to do [[AOL]] Sessions Under Cover. It was released on July 20 and featured two songs from ''Paper Walls''.

The group supported [[Blue October]] during the band's United States 2007 fall tour and also supported [[Linkin Park]] in Japan in November/December 2007. While touring for ''Paper Walls'', Peter Mosely announced in a Myspace blog message that he would be leaving Yellowcard to pursue other endeavors, moving back to Jacksonville and rejoining his old band. [[Josh Portman]] from the bands Near Miss and Staring Back took over on bass until the reformation of Yellowcard in 2010, upon which Sean O'Donnell of [[Reeve Oliver]] became the bass player.\n\nOn January 7, Yellowcard went to the Middle East to do a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tour. The group went to [[Kuwait]] as originally planned, but could not get into [[Iraq]] because of the President arriving and canceling all flights there.<ref>[http://www.yellowcardrock.com/blog.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112122001/http://www.yellowcardrock.com/blog.aspx|date=January 12, 2010}}</ref> The band released a live album on January 22, 2008, titled ''[[iTunes Live from Las Vegas at the Palms (Yellowcard album)|iTunes Live from Las Vegas at the Palms]]''.

They were then replaced by [[MxPx]], who canceled a few weeks later. Yellowcard then went on an acoustic tour with [[The Spill Canvas]], [[Secondhand Serenade]], [[Analog Rebellion|PlayRadioPlay!]], and [[Treaty of Paris (band)|Treaty of Paris]].\n\n===Hiatus (2008\u20132010)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:GW500H333.png|right|thumb|The band in 2007]] -->\nYellowcard announced in an interview in April 2008 that the group would be going on an \"indefinite hiatus.\" The band's European tour set for 2008 was canceled, and they instead embarked on an acoustic tour in the spring of 2008 before going on hiatus. Among the reasons for the band's hiatus were individual member situations. Longineu Parsons took some time off in the winter to spend time with family and joined a [[side project]] band based in Jacksonville, Florida. Sean Mackin got married in 2008 and wanted to take some time off to spend with his family. Ryan Key stated that the members needed some time to figure out their personal lives. The band members were unsure of the hiatus' length, but they assured their fans they planned to return as a group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=314190 |title=Yellowcard on Indefinite Hiatus \u2013 News Article \u2013 |publisher=Absolutepunk.net |date=2008-04-25 |access-date=2011-07-18 |archive-date=2020-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122184309/https://chorus.fm/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In May 2008, Yellowcard left Capitol Records and was left unsigned.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} On June 16, 2009, Capitol released an EP titled ''Deep Cuts'', which consists of four previously released tracks.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe original Yellowcard members, Ben Harper, Warren Cooke, Todd Clary, Longineu Parsons, and Ben Dobson, announced they would be performing tracks from ''Where We Stand'' in Jacksonville, Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=319907 |title=Original Yellowcard Lineup To Perform Together \u2013 News Article \u2013 |publisher=Absolutepunk.net |access-date=2011-07-18 |archive-date=2020-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122184308/https://chorus.fm/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nYellowcard announced on [[Myspace]] that the group would be performing its first show in months at [[Utah State University]] on September 30, 2008. The set list was much like that of the band's previous tour performed with Ryan Key, Ryan Mendez, and Sean Mackin, which featured songs from the group's entire discography. The band later announced via Myspace that the group would be having another acoustic performance at [[Nicholls State University]] in [[Thibodaux, Louisiana]] on November 13, 2008.\n\nRyan Key and Sean O'Donnell of [[Reeve Oliver]] formed a small side project called Big If. Big If released many demos online and had a record due out in late 2009 which was cancelled. The band featured a more [[pop punk]] approach in most of its first songs, though by the time they had reached the second set of demos, they had almost completely progressed into a [[pop rock]] style. After the band's fourth set of demos, the band announced a fundraising event on February 10, 2010, called the \"Help Mend A Heart Auction\", which was to fund [[Jordan Pundik]]'s mother's heart transplant operation.

Busch did highlight that the members had incredibly mixed emotions about continuing the lawsuit.<blockquote>\u201cMy clients are certainly torn about proceeding, and understand the optics involved. But it is important to remember that this lawsuit was filed before this tragic event, and was filed because all of the defendants (and there are two other writers and several music publishers and record labels), profited off of what we believe was clear copying and infringement of Yellowcard\u2019s work.\u201d - Richard Busch<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |date=2019-12-19 |title=Yellowcard 'Torn' But 'Proceeding' With Juice WRLD 'Lucid Dreams' Lawsuit |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/juice-wrld-yellowcard-lawsuit-lucid-dreams-929339/ |access-date=2022-03-13 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>Yellowcard ultimately chose to drop the lawsuit in 2020 after Juice Wrld's mother became the representative of his estate.
