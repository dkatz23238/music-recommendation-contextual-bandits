Founded as '''The Primettes''' in [[Detroit]], Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and the most successful American [[vocal group]], with [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles|12 number-one singles]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, [[Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland]]. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled [[the Beatles]] in worldwide popularity, and it is said that their breakthrough made it possible for future African American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and soul musicians to find mainstream success. ''Billboard'' ranked the Supremes as the 16th greatest Hot 100 artist of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-hot-100-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Artists|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>\n\n[[Florence Ballard]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Betty McGlown]], the original group, were all from the [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects|Brewster-Douglass]] public housing project in Detroit. They formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes (with [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]] and [[Eddie Kendricks]], who went on to form [[the Temptations]]). [[Barbara Martin (singer)|Barbara Martin]] replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as '''The Supremes'''. Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a [[trio (music)|trio]].\n\nDuring the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer and Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland as its songwriting and production team. In 1967, Motown president [[Berry Gordy]] renamed the group '''Diana Ross & the Supremes''', and replaced Ballard with [[Cindy Birdsong]]. In 1970, Ross left to pursue a solo career and was replaced by [[Jean Terrell]] and the group reverted to being '''The Supremes''' again. During the mid-1970s, the lineup changed with [[Lynda Laurence]], [[Scherrie Payne]] and [[Susaye Greene]] joining until, after 18 years, the group  disbanded in 1977.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Frederick Douglass HomestowerDetroit.jpg|thumb|Frederick Douglass Housing Project in Detroit]]\nIn [[Detroit]] in 1958, [[Florence Ballard]], a junior high school student living in the [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects]], met [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]] and [[Eddie Kendricks]], who were two members of a Detroit singing group known as [[the Primes]].<ref name=\"Formation\">{{harvnb|Wilson|Bego|2019|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Ballard sang, as did Paul Williams' girlfriend [[Betty McGlown]], so Milton Jenkins, the Primes's manager, decided to create a sister group to be called the Primettes.<ref name=\"Formation\" /> Ballard recruited her best friend [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], and then Paul Williams recruited [[Diana Ross]].<ref name=\"Formation\" /> Mentored and funded by Jenkins, the Primettes began by performing hit songs of artists such as [[Ray Charles]] and [[the Drifters]] at [[sock hop]]s, social clubs and talent shows around the Detroit area.<ref name=\"talent shows\">{{harvnb|Wilson|Bego|2019|pp=20\u201322}}</ref> Receiving additional guidance from group friend and established songwriter [[Jesse Greer]], the quartet quickly earned a local fan following.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|Romanowski|1999|p=49 (Dreamgirl)}}</ref> The girls crafted an age-appropriate style that was inspired by the collegiate dress of popular [[doo-wop]] group [[The Teenagers|Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers]].

Black [[rock and roll]] musicians of the 1950s had seen many of their original hit tunes covered by white musicians, with these covers usually achieving more fame and sales success than the originals. The Supremes' success, however, counteracted this trend. Featuring three group members who were marketed for their individual personalities (a move unprecedented at the time) and Diana Ross's pop-friendly voice, the Supremes broke down racial barriers with rock and roll songs underpinned by [[R&B]] stylings. The group became extremely popular both domestically and abroad, becoming one of the first black musical acts to appear regularly on television programs such as ''[[Hullabaloo (television)|Hullabaloo]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', ''[[Della Reese|The Della Reese Show]]'', and, most notably, ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', on which they made 17 appearances.<ref name=\"Yusuf\" /> In 2003, [[Fred Bronson]] wrote that in 1959, when the Supremes formed as the Primettes, \"no one could have predicted they would become the most successful American singing group of all time.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=155}}</ref>\n\n=== Changes ===\nProblems within the group and within Motown Records' stable of performers led to tension among the members of the Supremes. Many of the other Motown performers felt that Berry Gordy was lavishing too much attention upon the group and upon Ross, in particular.<ref name=\"Unterberger\" /> In early 1967, the name of the act was officially changed briefly to \"the Supremes with Diana Ross\" before changing again to \"Diana Ross & the Supremes\" by mid-summer.<ref name=\"Kellman\"/> The Miracles had become \"Smokey Robinson & the Miracles\" two years prior. The fall of 1967 saw Martha & the Vandellas become \"Martha Reeves & the Vandellas\".<ref>Jaynes, Gerald David. ''Encyclopedia of African American Society''.

''The Supremes: A Saga of Motown Dreams, Success, and Betrayal''. Da Capo Press {{ISBN|978-0-306-81586-7}}, p. 284.</ref>\n\nThe Supremes' name change fueled already present rumors of a solo career for Ross and contributed to the professional and personal dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross with [[Barbara Randolph]] as early as the fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in the group for several more years.<ref>Ribowsky, Mark (2009).

During this turbulent period, Ballard relied heavily upon the advice of group mate Mary Wilson, with whom she had maintained a close friendship. Wilson, while outwardly demure and neutral in hopes of keeping the group stable, privately advised Ballard that Ross and Gordy were eager to oust Ballard.<ref>{{harvnb|Benjaminson|2008|p=92}}</ref>\n[[File:The Supremes 1967.JPG|thumb|left|[[Cindy Birdsong]] (right)]]\nBy 1967, Ballard would not show up for recording dates, or would arrive at shows too inebriated to perform. For some early 1967 shows, she was replaced by Marlene Barrow (a member of the Motown backup group [[The Andantes]]). Looking for a more permanent replacement, Gordy once again thought of Barbara Randolph, possibly believing that Randolph could be groomed as lead singer for the group once it was decided to take Ross solo. However, Ross did not receive Randolph well. In April 1967, Gordy then contacted [[Cindy Birdsong]], a member of [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle & the Blue Belles]] who superficially resembled Ballard, with plans to bring her in as Ballard's replacement.<ref name=\"BallardOusterMR\">Ribowsky, Mark (2009).

In May, Ballard returned for what she believed was a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy was able to buy out Birdsong's contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step away from being dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time and sober. Despite this, Birdsong was secretly traveling with the Supremes, studying their routines.<ref name=\"BallardOusterMR\" />\n\nOn June 29, 1967, the group returned to the [[Flamingo Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] as \"Diana Ross & the Supremes\". The first two days of the Flamingo engagement went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group.

Terrell was signed to Motown and began recording the first post-Ross Supremes songs with Wilson and Birdsong during the day, while Wilson and Birdsong toured with Ross at night.

On both \"Floy Joy\" and \"Sunshine\" Terrell shared lead with Mary Wilson. Motown, by then moving from Detroit to Los Angeles to break into motion pictures, put only limited effort into promoting the Supremes' new material, and their popularity and sales began to wane.

The 1974 line-up of the Supremes (Wilson, Birdsong and Payne) was considered for this reunion, which was to include new recordings and a tour. Under advisement from Berry Gordy, Wilson declined to reunite, and the idea was scrapped. Ross briefly reunited with Wilson and Birdsong to perform \"Someday We'll Be Together\" on the ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'' television special, taped on March 25, 1983, and broadcast on [[NBC]] on May 16, 1983.<ref>Pareles, Jon.

Susaye Greene was also considered for this tour, but refused to audition for it. The music critics cried foul and many fans were disappointed by both this and the shows' high ticket prices. Though the tour did well in larger markets including near capacity at the opening night in Philadelphia and a sellout at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York, it under performed in smaller/medium markets.
