DO NOT change \"WERE\" to \"WAS\". --> an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group comprised vocalist [[Robert Plant]], guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], bassist/keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], and drummer [[John Bonham]]. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although their style drew from a variety of influences, including [[blues]] and [[folk music]]. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of [[album-oriented rock]] (AOR) and [[Arena rock|stadium rock]].\n\nOriginally named the [[The Yardbirds#The Yardbirds, The New Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin|New Yardbirds]], Led Zeppelin signed a deal with [[Atlantic Records]] that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'', was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as \"[[Good Times Bad Times]]\", \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\" and \"[[Communication Breakdown]]\". ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded \"[[Ramble On]]\" and \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". In 1970, they released ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' which featured \"[[Immigrant Song]]\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971), is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes \"[[Black Dog (Led Zeppelin song)|Black Dog]]\", \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\" and \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'' (1973) yielded \"[[The Ocean (Led Zeppelin song)|The Ocean]]\", \"[[Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin song)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]\" and \"[[The Rain Song]]\". ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' (1975), a double album, featured \"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\" and \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\".\n\nPage wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to their music, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of [[Led Zeppelin concerts|record-breaking tours]] that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'' (1976) and ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' (1979), grew limited, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death in 1980. Since then, the surviving former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in London, with Bonham's son [[Jason Bonham]] on drums.\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the [[list of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]; their total record sales are estimated to be between 200 to 300&nbsp;million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with five of their albums [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|certified Diamond]] in the US. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the Seventies\", and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \"as influential\" during the 1970s as [[the Beatles]] were during the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/led-zeppelin/bio/ |title=Led Zeppelin Biography |work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |access-date=5 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628093543/http://rockhall.com/inductees/led-zeppelin/bio/}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation: 1966\u20131968  ===\n[[File:Led Zeppelin logo.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|The band's logotype, used since 1973|alt=The name Led Zeppelin in irregular capitals in black and white]]\nIn 1966, London-based session guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] joined the blues-influenced rock band [[the Yardbirds]] to replace bassist [[Paul Samwell-Smith]]. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with [[Jeff Beck]]. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring and recording, began to wind down.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|pp=56\u201359}} Page wanted to form a [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] with Beck and him on guitars, and [[the Who]]'s [[Keith Moon]] and [[John Entwistle]] on drums and bass, respectively.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=15\u201316}} Vocalists [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Steve Marriott]] were also considered for the project.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=13\u201315}} The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon did record a song together in 1966, \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\", in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]].{{sfn|Davis|1985|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nThe Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at [[University of Bedfordshire|Luton College of Technology]] in Bedfordshire.{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}} They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer [[Jim McCarty]] and vocalist [[Keith Relf]] authorised Page and bassist [[Chris Dreja]] to use the Yardbirds' name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was [[Terry Reid]], but Reid declined the offer and suggested [[Robert Plant]], a singer for the [[Band of Joy]] and Hobbstweedle.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=65}} Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer [[John Bonham]].{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} John Paul Jones enquired about the vacant position of bass guitarist, at the suggestion of his wife, after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=10}}{{refn|group=nb|Dreja would later take the photograph that appeared on the back of Led Zeppelin's debut album.{{sfn|Fyfe|2003|p=45}}}} Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians, and agreed to let him join as the final member.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=64}}\n[[File:Hindenburg disaster.jpg|alt=A black and white photograph of an airship near a mooring mast exploding at its stern.|left|thumb|A 1937 photograph of the burning [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]] taken by news photographer Sam Shere, used on the cover of the band's debut album and extensively on later merchandise]]\nIn August 1968, the four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]] in London.{{sfn|Lewis|1994|p=3}} Page suggested that they attempt \"[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]\", originally a [[jump blues]] song popularised in a [[rockabilly]] version by [[Johnny Burnette]], which had been covered by the Yardbirds. \"As soon as I heard John Bonham play\", Jones recalled, \"I knew this was going to be great&nbsp;... We locked together as a team immediately\".{{sfn|Welch |Nicholls|2001|p=75}} Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the [[P. J. Proby]] album ''[[Three Week Hero]]''. The album's track \"Jim's Blues\", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=54}}\n\nThe band completed the [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|Scandinavian tour]] as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], Denmark, on 7 September 1968.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=54}} Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=51\u201352}} After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a [[cease and desist]] letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=72\u201373}} One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a \"lead balloon\", an idiom for disastrous results.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=36}} The group dropped the 'a' in ''lead'' at the suggestion of their manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it \"leed\".{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=57}} The word \"balloon\" was replaced by \"[[zeppelin]]\", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought \"the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace\" to Page's mind.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=36}}\n\nGrant secured a $143,000 advance contract (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|143000|1968|r=-3}}}} today) from [[Atlantic Records]] in November 1968\u2014at the time, the biggest deal of its kind for a new band.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=84}} Atlantic was a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s, it began to take an interest in British [[progressive rock]] acts. At the recommendation of British singer [[Dusty Springfield]], a friend of Jones who at the time was completing her first Atlantic album, ''[[Dusty in Memphis]]'', record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them.{{sfn|Fortnam|2008|p=43}} Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.{{sfn|Lewis|1994|p=3}}\n\n=== Early years: 1968\u20131970 ===\nThe band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, still billed as the New Yardbirds; they played their first show as Led Zeppelin at the [[University of Surrey]] in [[Battersea]] on 25 October.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/show/october-25-1968 |title=Concert Timeline: October 25, 1968 |website=Led Zeppelin.com |access-date=3 November 2017 |url-status=live |archive-date=2 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102222301/http://www.ledzeppelin.com/show/october-25-1968}}</ref> Tour manager [[Richard Cole]], who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1968\u20131969|first North American tour]] at the end of the year.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=94}}{{refn|group=nb|The first show was in Denver on 26 December 1968, followed by other West Coast dates before the band travelled to California to play Los Angeles and San Francisco.{{sfn|Wall|2008||pp=92\u201393}}}} Their debut album, ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'', was released in the US during the tour on 12 January 1969, and peaked at number 10 on the ''Billboard'' chart;<ref>{{cite web |title=Led Zeppelin Billboard Albums |website=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/led-zeppelin-p4739/charts-awards |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906193322/http://allmusic.com/artist/led-zeppelin-p4739/charts-awards}}</ref> it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=92, 147, 152}} According to [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Steve Erlewine]], the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic blues]], groovy, [[Swing (jazz performance style)|bluesy shuffles]] and hints of [[Folk music of England|English folk music]] made it \"a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal\".{{sfn|Erlewine|2011b}}\n\n[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107.jpg|thumb|[[Bron-Yr-Aur]], near [[Machynlleth]], the Welsh cottage to which Page and Plant retired in 1970 to write many of the tracks that appeared on the band's third and fourth albums|alt=A colour photograph of a stone cottage on a hill]]\nIn their first year, Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK [[concert tour]]s, and also released their second album, ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]''. Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=161}} The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was \"heavy and hard, brutal and direct\", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated.{{sfn|Erlewine|2010}} Steve Waksman has suggested that ''Led Zeppelin II'' was \"the musical starting point for heavy metal\".{{sfn|Waksman|2001|p=263}}\n\nThe band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=166\u2013167}} In 1969, an edited version of \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\", a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the ''Billboard'' chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=165}} The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts.{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=49}}{{sfn|Wale|1973|p=11}}\n\nFollowing the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} Some early [[Led Zeppelin concerts]] lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as [[Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings|bootleg recordings]]. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.{{sfn|Wall|2008}}{{refn|group=nb|One alleged example of such extravagance was the shark episode said to have taken place at the [[The Edgewater (Seattle, Washington)|Edgewater Inn]] in [[Seattle]] on 28 July 1969.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=103}}{{sfn|Wall|2008}}}}\n\nIn 1970, Page and Plant retired to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], a remote cottage in [[Wales]], to commence work on their third album, ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Led Zeppelin at Bron-Yr-Aur |date=30 June 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/history/pages/led-zeppelin-bron-yr-aur.shtml |work=BBC Wales Music |access-date=16 September 2011 |url-status=live |archive-date=14 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514164952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/history/pages/led-zeppelin-bron-yr-aur.shtml}}</ref> The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by [[folk music|folk]] and [[Celtic music]], and showcased the band's versatility. The album's rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with critics and fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric arrangements of the first two albums, further fuelling the band's hostility to the musical press.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=208\u2013209}} It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the shortest of their first five albums.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=130}} The album's opening track, \"[[Immigrant Song]]\", was released as a US single in November 1970 against the band's wishes, reaching the top twenty on the ''Billboard'' chart.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=129}}\n{{clear}}\n=== \"The Biggest Band in the World\": 1970\u20131975 ===\n\nDuring the 1970s, Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one of the most influential groups of the era, eclipsing their earlier achievements.{{sfn|Waksman|2001|p=238}}{{sfn|Wall|2008}} The band's image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing, with Page taking the lead on the flamboyant appearance by wearing a glittering moon-and-stars outfit. Led Zeppelin changed their show by using things such as lasers, professional light shows and mirror balls.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=281}} They began travelling in a private jet airliner, a [[Boeing 720]] (nicknamed ''[[the Starship]]''), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the [[Andaz West Hollywood|Continental Hyatt House]] in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the \"Riot House\"), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House,{{sfn|Wall|2008a}} while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts|Hilton]], leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life.{{sfn|Williamson|2005|p=68}} Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist [[Chris Welch]], \"[Led Zeppelin's] travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour\".{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=47}}\n\nLed Zeppelin released their [[Led Zeppelin IV|fourth album]] on 8 November 1971.  It is variously referred to as ''Led Zeppelin IV'', ''Untitled'', ''IV'', or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as ''Four Symbols'', ''Zoso'' or ''Runes''.{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=25}} The band had wanted to release the fourth album with no title or information, in response to the music press \"going on about Zeppelin being a hype\", but the record company wanted something on the cover, so in discussions, it was agreed to have four symbols to represent both the four members of the band and that it was the fourth album.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=269\u2013270}} With 37&nbsp;million copies sold, ''Led Zeppelin IV'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led Zeppelin's status as superstars in the 1970s.{{sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=128}}{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=480}} By 2021, it had sold 24&nbsp;million copies in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Led+Zeppelin&ti=Led+Zeppelin+iv&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section Gold & Platinum - RIAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nThe track \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", never released as a single, was the most requested and most played song on American rock radio in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Monitor |magazine=Broadcasting |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc. |date=12 November 1979 }}</ref> The group followed up the album's release with [[Led Zeppelin United Kingdom Tour Winter 1971|tours of the UK]], [[Led Zeppelin Australasian Tour 1972|Australasia]], [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1972|North America]], [[Led Zeppelin Japanese Tour 1972|Japan]], and [[Led Zeppelin United Kingdom Tour 1972\u20131973|the UK again]] from late 1971 through early 1973.\n\n[[File:Led Zeppelin acoustic 1973.jpg|thumb|Plant and Page perform acoustically in [[Hamburg]] in March 1973, just before the release of the band's fifth album, ''[[Houses of the Holy]]''|alt=A black and white photograph of Robert Plant with a tambourine and Jimmy Page with an acoustic guitar seated and performing.]]\nLed Zeppelin's next album, ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'', was released in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and [[mellotron]] orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group [[Hipgnosis]], depicts images of nude children climbing the [[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\n''Houses of the Holy'' topped charts worldwide,{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=294}} and the band's subsequent [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1973|concert tour of North America in 1973]] broke records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At [[Tampa Stadium]] in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour|the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert]] and grossing $309,000.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=194}} Three sold-out shows at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'') was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|180000|1973|r=-3}}}} today) of the band's money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at the [[Drake Hotel (New York City)|Drake Hotel]].{{sfn|Yorke|1993|pp=186\u2013187}} Also in 1973, the band purchased [[Hammerwood Park]], a Georgian mansion in [[East Sussex]], at auction, which they planned to turn into a recording studio and accommodation. However, the house was in an increasing state of dereliction and the plans were eventually shelved. Although it would be used in the filming of the music video for ''The Song Remains the Same'', the house was subsequently boarded up and put up for sale in 1976.\n\n[[File:LedZeppelinChicago75 2.jpg|thumb|left|Led Zeppelin perform at [[Chicago Stadium]] in January 1975, a few weeks before the release of ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''|alt=A colour photograph of the four members of Led Zeppelin performing onstage, with some other figures visible in the background.]]\n\nIn 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, [[Swan Song Records|Swan Song]], named after an unreleased song.

It consisted of fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at [[Headley Grange]] in 1974 and seven had been recorded earlier. A review in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine referred to ''Physical Graffiti'' as Led Zeppelin's \"bid for artistic respectability\", adding that the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title \"The World's Best Rock Band\" were [[the Rolling Stones]] and the Who.{{sfn|Miller|1975}} The album was a massive commercial and critical success.

The band then reconvened in [[Malibu, California]]. During this forced hiatus, much of the material for their next album, ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'', was written.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=364}}\n\nBy this time, Led Zeppelin were the world's number one rock attraction,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=45}} having outsold most bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=173}} ''Presence'', released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] seller, ''Presence'' received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}}{{sfn|Davis|1976}} Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although he has since denied this.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=364}}\n\nBecause of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert film ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'' and the accompanying [[The Song Remains the Same (album)|soundtrack album]]. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their [[tax exile]] status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=320}}\n\n[[File:Silverdome 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Pontiac [[Silverdome]], Michigan, where the band set a record for the largest solo indoor attraction in 1977 with an attendance of 76,229|alt=a colour photograph of a large domed stadium]]\nIn 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|concert tour of North America]].

On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]].{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=92}} During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (from {{convert|16|to|24|usoz|abbr=on}}), with a ham roll.

The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house\u2014the Old Mill House in [[Clewer]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].\n\nAfter midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45&nbsp;pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead.

The group, featuring Page on lead guitar, along with studio musicians and friends of the pair, including Jeff Beck, [[Paul Shaffer]], and [[Nile Rodgers]], released its only album in 1984.  Plant focused on a different direction from Zeppelin, playing [[Standard (music)|standards]] and in a more [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] style, highlighted by a cover of \"[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]\" that peaked at number three on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]] in early 1985.{{sfn|Huey|2011}}\n\n''[[Coda (Led Zeppelin album)|Coda]]'' \u2013 a collection of Zeppelin outtakes and unused tracks \u2013 was issued in November 1982.

Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=294\u2013296 and 364\u2013366}} In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=412\u2013413}}\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page early.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Page with the double-neck [[Gibson EDS-1275]] used for playing \"Stairway to Heaven\" among other songs live|alt=A black and white photograph of Jimmy Page playing a double-necked guitar]]\nEarly lyrics drew on the band's blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=25}} Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music.{{Sfn|Cope|2010|p=81}} Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as [[misogyny|misogynistic]].{{sfn|Cope|2010|p=81}} Particularly on ''Led Zeppelin III'', they incorporated elements of [[mythology]] and [[mysticism]] into their music,{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=59}} These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the [[occult]], which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in [[backmasking]]; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=278\u2013279}} The pastoral fantasies in Plant's songwriting were inspired by the landscape of the [[Black Country]] region and [[J.

While noting Plant \"hints at real feeling\" on some of their acoustic songs, Christgau believed he abandoned traditional blues singing's emphasis on emotional projection in favor of vocal precision and dynamics: \"Whether he is mouthing sexist blues cliches or running through one of the band's half-audible, half-comprehensible ... lyrics about chivalry or the counter-culture, his voice is devoid of feeling. Like the tenors and baritones of yore, he wants his voice to be an instrument\u2014specifically, an electric guitar.\"{{sfn|Christgau|1972a}} Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum; while Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=13}}{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=At some deep level, Led Zeppelin's music is about the relationship between humanity and technology. Philosophically, the band prefers humanity pure and simple, but in practice it must realize its humanity technologically. That seems truer than most good-time pastoral fantasies.{{sfn|Christgau|1972a}}|source=\u2014[[Robert Christgau]], 1972|width=30%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}\n\nLed Zeppelin have been widely viewed as a hard rock band, although Christgau regarded them as [[art rock]] as well.{{sfn|Christgau|1980}} According to popular music scholar Reebee Garofalo, \"because hip critics could not find a constructive way of positioning themselves in relation to Led Zeppelin's ultra-macho presentation, they were excluded from the art rock category despite their broad range of influences.\"{{sfn|Garofalo|2008|p=233}} Christgau wrote in 1972, the band could be considered art rock because they \"relate to rock and roll not organically but intellectually\", idealizing the \"amplified beat\" as \"a kind of formal challenge\". Unlike their contemporaries in [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] and [[Yes (band)|Yes]], who use \"the physical compulsion of beat and volume to involve the mind\", Led Zeppelin \"make body music of an oddly cerebral cast, arousing aggression rather than sexuality.\" As such, along with other second-generation English hard rock bands like [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Mott the Hoople]], they can attract both intellectuals and working-class youths in \"a strange potential double audience.\"{{sfn|Christgau|1972b}} Years later, ''In Through the Out Door''{{'}}s \"tuneful synthesizer pomp\" further confirmed for Christgau they were an art rock band.{{sfn|Christgau|1980}}\n\nPage stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had \"light and shade\". This began to be more clearly realised beginning with ''Led Zeppelin III'', which made greater use of acoustic instruments.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} This approach has been seen as exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds.{{sfn|Schinder |Schwartz|2008|p=390}}{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=79}} Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and [[progressive rock|progressive]] sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs.{{sfn|Schinder |Schwartz|2008|pp=380\u2013391}} They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and [[Overdubbing|overdubbed]] guitar parts.{{sfn|Gulla|2001|pp=153\u2013159}} Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement{{sfn|Gulla|2001|pp=153\u2013159}} has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre.{{sfn|Brackett|2008|pp=53\u201376}}{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=585}} Ian Peddie argues that they were \"...&nbsp;loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also
