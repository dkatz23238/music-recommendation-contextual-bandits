He started his recording career in the mid-1990s on the Mexican indie label [[Fonovisa]] and became the bestselling Spanish-language act of the decade. By the turn of the millennium, he made a successful crossover into the mainstream English-language market. He signed a multi-album deal with [[Universal Music Group]] for US$68&nbsp;million with [[Universal Music Latin Entertainment|Universal Music Latino]] to release his Spanish albums and [[Interscope Records]] to release English albums.\n\nIn 2010, Iglesias parted with Interscope Records and signed with another Universal Music Group label, [[Republic Records]], to release bilingual albums. In 2015, he parted ways with Universal Music Group after being there for over a decade.

In Toronto, he borrowed money from his family nanny and recorded a demo cassette tape which consisted of a Spanish song and two English songs. Approaching his father's former publicist, Fern\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, the two promoted the songs under the stage name Enrique Mart\u00ednez with the backstory of being a singer from [[Guatemala]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/enrique-iglesias-to-the-max/|title=Enrique Iglesias to the max|work=[[CBS News]]|date=16 March 2014|access-date=16 February 2015}}</ref> Iglesias was signed on to [[Fonovisa Records]]. \n\n===1995\u20131996: ''Enrique Iglesias''===\nOn November 21, 1995, Iglesias released ''[[Enrique Iglesias (album)|Enrique Iglesias]]'', a collection of light rock ballads, including hits such as \"[[Si T\u00fa Te Vas (Enrique Iglesias song)|Si T\u00fa Te Vas]]\" and \"[[Experiencia Religiosa]]\". This album, along with Iglesias' next two, was released by the Mexican label Fonovisa. The record sold half a million copies in its first week, a rare accomplishment then for an album recorded in a language other than English, going Gold in Portugal within the first week of release, and sold over a million copies in the next three months.\n\nHis song \"[[Por Amarte]]\" was included in [[Televisa]]'s [[telenovela]] ''Marisol'', but with a twist: instead of ''Por amarte dar\u00eda mi vida'' (To love you, I'd give my life), the words were ''Por amarte Marisol, morir\u00eda'' (To love you, Marisol, I'd die). The CD also yielded Italian and Portuguese editions, with most of the songs translated into those languages.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, such as \"Por Amarte\", \"[[No Llores Por M\u00ed]]\", and \"[[Trapecista]]\" all of which topped the ''Billboard''{{'}}s Latin charts. The album still holds the record for producing the most number one singles on the Billboard's Hot Latin songs chart. The album went on to win Iglesias the [[Grammy Award]] for Best Latin Pop Performance.\n\n===1997\u20131998: ''Vivir'' and ''Cosas del Amor''===\nIn 1997, Iglesias' stardom continued to rise with the release of ''[[Vivir (Enrique Iglesias album)|Vivir]]'' (''To Live''), which put him up with other English-language music superstars in sales for that year. The album also included a cover version of the [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]] song \"[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\", translated into Spanish as \"Solo en T\u00ed\".\n\nThree singles were released from ''Vivir'': \"[[Enamorado Por Primera Vez]]\", \"[[Solo en ti|S\u00f3lo en Ti]]\", and \"[[Miente]]\", which topped the Latin singles chart as well as those in several Spanish-speaking countries. Along with his father and [[Luis Miguel]], Iglesias was nominated for an [[American Music Award]] in the first-ever awarded category of Favorite Latin Artist. Iglesias lost out to his father, but performed the song \"[[Lluvia Cae]]\" at the event.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInsisting on playing stadiums for his first concert tour, that summer, Iglesias, backed by [[Sideman|sidemen]] for [[Elton John]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], and [[Billy Joel]], played to sold-out audiences in sixteen countries. Beginning in [[Odessa, Texas]], the tour went on to play three consecutive nights in Mexico's [[Plaza de toros M\u00e9xico|Plaza de Toros]], two consecutive nights at [[Monterrey]]'s [[Auditorio Coca-Cola]], and two at the Estadio River Plate in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, to over 130,000 people, as well as 19 arenas in the U.S.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ondanet.com/latinos/Enrique.Iglesias/vivir-eng.html|title=Enrique Iglesias begins his worldwide tour Vivir|publisher=Ondanet|date=31 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Iglesias released his third album ''[[Cosas del Amor (Enrique Iglesias album)|Cosas del Amor]]'' (''Things of Love''). Taking a more mature musical direction, the album, aided by the popular singles \"[[Esperanza (Enrique Iglesias song)|Esperanza]]\" and \"[[Nunca Te Olvidar\u00e9]]\", both of which topped the Latin singles chart, helped cement his status in the [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music scene]].\n\nIglesias did a short tour of smaller venues to accompany the release of the album, with one show being televised from [[Acapulco]], Mexico. This was followed by a larger world tour of over eighty shows in even bigger venues. The ''Cosas del Amor'' Tour was the first ever concert tour sponsored by [[McDonald's]].\n\nHe won an American Music Award in the category of Favorite Latin Artist against [[Ricky Martin]] and [[Chayanne]]. The song \"Nunca te Olvidar\u00e9\" was also used as the theme music for a Spanish soap opera of the same name and he sang the song himself on the last episode of the series.\n\n===1999\u20132000: ''Enrique''===\nIn 1999, Iglesias began a successful crossover career into the English-language music market. Thanks to other successful crossover acts, most notably [[Ricky Martin]], Latino artists and music had a great surge in popularity in mainstream music that year. After attending one of his concerts in March 1999, [[Will Smith]] asked Iglesias to contribute to the soundtrack of his movie ''[[Wild Wild West]]''. His contribution \"Bailamos\" was released as a single and became a number one hit in the US.\n\nAfter the success of \"[[Bailamos]]\", several mainstream record labels were eager to sign Iglesias. Signing a multi-album deal after weeks of negotiations with [[Interscope]], Iglesias recorded and released his first full CD in English, ''[[Enrique (album)|Enrique]]''. The pop album, with some Latin influences, took two months to complete. It contained the song \"[[Rhythm Divine]]\", a duet with [[Whitney Houston]] titled \"[[Could I Have This Kiss Forever]]\", and a cover of the [[Bruce Springsteen]] song \"[[Sad Eyes (Bruce Springsteen song)|Sad Eyes]]\".\n\nIn 2000, Iglesias performed at the [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] halftime show alongside [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Phil Collins]] and [[Toni Braxton]]. Shock jock [[Howard Stern]] repeatedly played a tape of a supposedly very off-key Iglesias on his radio show and accused him of not being able to sing live. On 8 June 2000, Iglesias sang the song live on Stern's show with just a guitar accompanying him. After the performance, Stern remarked, \"I respect you for coming in here; you really can sing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/971810/20000608/index.jhtml |title=Enrique Iglesias Proves He Really Can Sing |publisher=Vh1.com |date=8 June 2000 |access-date=27 May 2012}}</ref> Iglesias noted that the recording could have been him, but that it was probably a recording made during a television taping where he was required to [[lip sync]] and not sing properly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/971810/enrique-iglesias-proves-he-really-can-sing/ |title=Enrique Iglesias Proves He Really Can Sing |publisher=MTV |access-date=11 August 2014}}</ref> He would remark that the controversy was the best promotion he could have. The album's single \"[[Be with You (Enrique Iglesias song)|Be with You]]\" became Iglesias' second number-one single on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100.\n\n=== 2001\u20132002: ''Escape'' and ''Quizas'' ===\nIn 2001, Iglesias released his second English-language album ''[[Escape (Enrique Iglesias album)|Escape]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011124150422/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2001/11/0601.cfm \"Enrique Iglesias Escape\"]. ''Chart Attack'', Review by Brian Pascual, 6 November 2001.</ref> Where most of the Latin crossover acts of the previous year experienced some difficulty matching the record sales of their first English-language albums, Iglesias actually went on to sell even more with the album being certified Diamond for shipments of over 10&nbsp;million copies. The album's first single, \"[[Hero (Enrique Iglesias song)|Hero]]\", became a number-one hit in the United Kingdom, and in many other countries. The entire album was co-written by Iglesias.\n\n''Escape'' is his biggest commercial success to date. The singles \"[[Escape (Enrique Iglesias song)|Escape]]\" and \"[[Don't Turn Off the Lights]]\" became radio staples, placing highly or topping various charts both in North America and elsewhere. A second edition of the album was released internationally and contained a new version of one of Iglesias' favorite tracks, \"[[Maybe (Enrique Iglesias song)|Maybe]]\", as well as a duet with [[Lionel Richie]] called \"[[To Love a Woman]]\".\n\nIglesias capitalized on the album's success with his \"One-Night Stand World Tour\" consisting of fifty sold-out shows in sixteen countries. Including [[Radio City Music Hall]] and three consecutive nights in London's [[Royal Albert Hall]], the tour ended with a big show at [[Lia Manoliu Stadium]] in [[Bucharest]], Romania. The concert launched MTV Romania, with the video for \"[[Love to See You Cry]]\" being the first to be shown on the channel.\n\nIn 2002, Iglesias decided to release a fourth Spanish-language album titled ''[[Quiz\u00e1s (album)|Quiz\u00e1s]]'' (''Perhaps''). A more polished musical production than his previous Spanish albums and containing more introspective songs, the album's title track is a song about the strained relationship Iglesias has with his famous father.\n\nThe album debuted at number twelve on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, the highest placement of a Spanish-language album on the chart at that period. ''Quiz\u00e1s'' sold a million copies in a week, making it the fastest-selling album in Spanish in five years. All three singles released from the album all ended up topping the Latin chart, giving Iglesias a total of sixteen number ones on the chart. He currently holds the record for the most number-one singles on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]{{'}}s Latin Chart. With the song \"[[Para Qu\u00e9 La Vida]]\" Iglesias reached a million spins on U.S. radio becoming the first Latin act to do so. The video to the song \"[[Quiz\u00e1s (Enrique Iglesias song)|Quiz\u00e1s]]\" was the first Spanish-language music video to be added to the selection on [[MTV]]'s popular show ''[[Total Request Live]]''.The album went on to win the [[Latin Grammy Awards|Latin Grammy Award]] for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, Male|Best Pop Vocal Album]].\n\nThat year he embarked on an arena tour of the Americas. The \"Don't Turn Off the Lights\" tour was completed in the summer of 2002, with two sold-out nights in [[Madison Square Garden]] and another two in Mexico's [[National Auditorium]]. The tour finished with a single show in the [[Roberto Clemente Coliseum]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].\n\n=== 2003\u20132004: ''Seven'' ===\nBy 2003, Iglesias had released his seventh album, which he called ''[[7 (Enrique Iglesias album)|7]]'', the second to be co-written by him. Among its more 1980s-inspired material, it features the song \"Roamer\", which he wrote with his friend and longtime guitarist [[Tony Bruno]]. The CD also contained the song \"Be Yourself\", a song about independence; the chorus talks about how Iglesias' own parents did not believe he'd ever succeed in his singing career. The first single was the song \"[[Addicted (Enrique Iglesias song)|Addicted]]\", and was followed closely by a remix of the song \"[[Not in Love (Enrique Iglesias song)|Not in Love]]\", featuring [[Kelis]].\n\nWith this album, Iglesias went on his biggest world tour to date. The highly publicised tour started with twelve shows in the United States ending with Iglesias playing at [[Houston Rodeo]], and continued on to several countries, most of which he'd never previously visited, playing to sold-out arenas and stadiums in Australia, India, Egypt, and Singapore, before ending his tour in [[South Africa]].\n\n===2007\u20132009: ''Insomniac'', ''95/08 \u00c9xitos'' and ''Greatest Hits''===\nAfter a two-year hiatus, Iglesias released his new album ''[[Insomniac (Enrique Iglesias album)|Insomniac]]'' on 12 June 2007.
