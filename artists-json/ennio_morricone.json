During the 1960s and 1970s he composed the scores for comedies such as ''[[Eighteen in the Sun]]'' (''Diciottenni al sole'', 1962), ''[[Il Successo]]'' (1963), [[Lina Wertm\u00fcller]]'s ''[[I basilischi]]'' (''The Basilisks''/''The Lizards'', 1963),<ref name=\"Biography of Ennio Morricone\"/> ''[[Slalom (film)|Slalom]]'' (1965), ''[[Menage all'italiana]]'' (''Menage Italian Style'', 1965), ''[[How I Learned to Love Women]]'' (''Come imparai ad amare le donne'', 1966), ''[[Her Harem]]'' (''L'harem'', 1967), ''[[A Fine Pair]]'' (''Ruba al prossimo tuo'', 1968), ''[[Alibi (1969 film)|L'Alibi]]'' (1969), ''[[This Kind of Love (film)|This Kind of Love]]'' (''Questa specie d'amore'', 1972), ''[[Winged Devils]]'' (''Forza \"G\"'', 1972), and ''[[Fiorina la vacca]]'' (1972).\n\nHis best-known scores for comedies includes ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1978) and ''[[La Cage aux Folles II]]'' (1980), both directed by [[\u00c9douard Molinaro]], ''[[Il ladrone]]'' (''The Good Thief'', 1980), [[Georges Lautner]]'s ''[[La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding]]'' (1985), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]]'s ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]'' (1990) and Warren Beatty's ''Bulworth'' (1998). Morricone never ceased to arrange and write music for comedies. In 2007, he composed a lighthearted score for the Italian romantic comedy ''Tutte le Donne della mia Vita'' by Simona Izzo, the director who co-wrote the Morricone-scored religious mini-series ''Il Papa Buono''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Nick |last=Vivarelli |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/morricone-i-can-do-anything-1117959621/ |title=Morricone: 'I can do anything' |magazine=Variety |date=15 February 2007 |access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Westerns ====\nAlthough his first films were undistinguished,{{Clarify|date=July 2020}} Morricone's arrangement of an American folk song intrigued director and former schoolmate [[Sergio Leone]]. Before being associated with Leone, Morricone already had composed some music for less-known western movies such as ''[[Duello nel Texas]]'' (aka ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') (1963). In 1962, Morricone met American folksinger [[Peter Tevis]], with the two collaborating on a version of [[Woody Guthrie]]'s ''[[Pastures of Plenty]]''. Tevis is credited with singing the lyrics of Morricone's songs such as \"A Gringo Like Me\" (from ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') and \"Lonesome Billy\" (from ''Bullets Don't Argue'').<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z9Tjh55dlDUC&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=morricone%20first%20western%20films Christopher Frayling, ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone''], I. B. Tauris, 2 April 2006.</ref> Tevis later recorded a vocal version of ''A Fistful of Dollars'' that was not used in the film.\n\n'''Association with Sergio Leone'''\nThe turning point in Morricone's career took place in 1964, the year in which his third child, [[Andrea Morricone]], who would also become a film composer, was born. Film director and former schoolmate Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's [[Spaghetti Western|different version]] of the [[Western (genre)|Western]], ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964).<ref>{{cite news |title=Morricone, la musica per il compagno di scuola Sergio Leone |url=https://www.adnkronos.com/intrattenimento/spettacolo/2020/07/06/morricone-musica-per-compagno-scuola-sergio-leone_66Md0LxcNpUYJufDdnzD7M.html |access-date=7 July 2020 |work=Adnkronos |date=6 July 2020 |language=it}}</ref>\n\n'''The [[Dollars Trilogy]]'''\n{{main|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (soundtrack)}}\n\nBecause budget strictures limited Morricone's access to a full orchestra, he used gunshots, cracking whips, whistle, voices, [[jew's harp]], trumpets, and the new Fender electric guitar, instead of orchestral arrangements of Western standards \u00e0 la [[John Ford]]. Morricone used his special effects to punctuate and comically tweak the action\u2014cluing in the audience to the [[silence|taciturn]] man's ironic stance.<ref name=\"Leinberger\" />{{rp|69\u201377}} <!--Though sonically bizarre for a movie score, Morricone's music was [[wikt:viscerally|viscerally]] true to Leone's vision.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}-->\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Ennio_Morricone-The_Good,_The_Bad_And_The_Ugly.ogg\n|title=The Good, The Bad and The Ugly main theme\n|description=From [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]] film score\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nAs memorable as Leone's [[close-up]]s, harsh violence, and black comedy, Morricone's work helped to expand the musical possibilities of film scoring. Initially, Morricone was billed on the film as Dan Savio, a name they had used on [[Duello nel Texas]] to help its appeal on the international market. ''A Fistful of Dollars'' came out in Italy in 1964 and was released in America three years later, greatly popularising the so-called [[Spaghetti Western]] genre. For the American release, Sergio Leone followed Morricone and [[Massimo Dallamano]]'s lead and decided to adopt an American-sounding name, Bob Robertson. Over the film's theatrical release, it grossed more than any other Italian film up to that point.<ref name=\"Hughes7\">{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Howard|title=Aim for the Heart: The Films of Clint Eastwood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbWKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 July 2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-85771-021-5|page=7}}</ref> The film debuted in the United States in January 1967, where it grossed {{USD|4.5&nbsp;million|link=yes}} for the year.<ref name=\"Hughes7\"/> It eventually grossed $14.5&nbsp;million in its American release,<ref name=\"Hughes7\"/> against its budget of {{USD}}200,000.<ref name=\"Giddins2010\">{{cite book|last=Giddins|first=Gary|title=Warning Shadows: Home Alone with Classic Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuYHM-Ltkx4C&pg=PA122|date=19 April 2010|publisher=W.

All three films starred the American actor [[Clint Eastwood]] as ''The Man With No Name'' and depicted Leone's own intense vision of the mythical West. Morricone commented in 2007: \"Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music to be an important part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end.\" According to Morricone this explains \"why the films are so slow\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/18/features.musicmonthly10 Q&A \u2013 Ennio Morricone] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 18 March 2007</ref>\n\nDespite the small film budgets, the ''Dollars Trilogy'' was a box-office success.

The American release gave Morricone an exposure in America and his film music became quite popular in the United States.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=G2lqIuCFJ_MC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=days%20of%20heaven%20terrence%20malick%20ennio%20morricone ''Ennio Morricone's The Good, The Bad And The Ugly: A Film Score Guide''], Charles Leinberger, Scarecrow Press, 1 September 2004</ref>\n\nOne of Morricone's first contributions to an American director concerned his music for the religious epic film ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' by [[John Huston]]. According to Sergio Miceli's book ''Morricone, la musica, il cinema'', Morricone wrote about 15 or 16&nbsp;minutes of music, which were recorded for a screen test and conducted by [[Franco Ferrara]]. At first Morricone's teacher [[Goffredo Petrassi]] had been engaged to write the score for the great big-budget epic, but Huston preferred another composer. [[RCA Records]] then proposed Morricone who was under contract with them, but a conflict between the film's producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and RCA occurred. The producer wanted to have exclusive rights for the soundtrack, while RCA still had the monopoly on Morricone at that time and did not want to release the composer. Subsequently, Morricone's work was rejected because he did not get permission from RCA to work for Dino De Laurentiis alone. The composer reused the parts of his unused score for ''The Bible: In the Beginning'' in such films as ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'' (1965) by [[Duccio Tessari]] and Alberto Negrin's ''[[The Secret of the Sahara]]'' (1987).\n\nMorricone never left Rome to compose his music and never learned to speak English. But given that the composer always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from \"[[absolute music]]\", which he always produced, to \"applied music\", working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, and then as a composer for theatre, radio, and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.<ref>[http://thequietus.com/articles/04050-ennio-morricone-interview-a-fistful-of-dollars-for-a-few-dollars-more-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-the-thing Ennio Morricone Interviewed: John Doran, \"Compared To Bach, I'm Practically Unemployed\"], Quietus interview, 8 April 2010.</ref>\n\n====1970\u20131985: From ''Two Mules'' to ''Red Sonja''====\n\nIn 1970, Morricone composed the music for [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'', an American-Mexican western film starring [[Shirley MacLaine]] and Clint Eastwood.
