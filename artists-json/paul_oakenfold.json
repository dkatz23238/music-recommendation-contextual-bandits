Trevor Fung, Nicky Holloway, Ian Saint Paul, [[Danny Rampling]] and Johnny Walker accompanied him. Oakenfold convinced the owner of a venue in England to host an \"Ibiza Reunion\" party after-hours. He had previously made an attempt, but it failed as the crowd was not prepared for the [[acid house]] style until 1987 when the party was successful. After that, the night became a classic and became one of the UK's major acid house nights, known as ''Spectrum'' at [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]] in [[Charing Cross]]. The party was best known for the \"Theatre of Madness\", as more than 1,500 people were present on Monday nights, until it went down; with the financial issues it changed its name to the \"Land of Oz\". Artists like [[Alex Paterson]] DJ'd in the VIP [[chillout]] area known as the \"White Room\", which gave Oakenfold more free time, and then he began producing music under the alias \"[[Electra (band)|Electra]]\" in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/25038/electra/|title=ELECTRA &#124; full Official Chart History |website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=25 June 2021}}</ref> Members included Nick Divaris, [[John Rocca|John \"Johnny\" Rocca]] and Micky.

The remixes of \"Rave On\" and \"Hallelujah\" were released on the ''Madchester Rave On'' EP, as well as \"Step On\", a covered version adapted from [[John Kongos]]' 1971 hit \"He's Gonna Step On You\".
