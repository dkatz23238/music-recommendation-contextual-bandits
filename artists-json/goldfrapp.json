The album features ten tracks. All the track titles, with the exception of \"Stranger\", are given people's names. Goldfrapp confirmed via Twitter that the sound of the album focuses on their softer sounds similar to that of their d\u00e9but piece ''[[Felt Mountain]]'' as well as their 2008 release ''[[Seventh Tree]]''. Accompanying this announcement was the re-launch of the duo's website which features a trailer video directed by [[Lisa Gunning]] with the first dates announced for their [[Tales of Us Tour]]. \"Drew\", the first single from the album, was released on 2 September 2013 with an accompanying film directed by Gunning, the first of five films subsequently released to promote the album. Preceding the album's release, Goldfrapp performed the album in its entirety with a 24-piece orchestra and choir over two nights at the Manchester International Festival. ''[[Tales of Us]]'' was nominally successful upon release, charting in the top 20 in over 15 countries. In March 2014, the Tales of Us worldwide cinema event took place, featuring the full Tales of Us film and a live performance from Air Studios in London. Further singles from the album included \"Annabel\" and \"Stranger\".\n\n===2015\u2013present: ''Silver Eye''===\nIn July 2015, Alison Goldfrapp announced on Twitter that the group had returned to the studio to work on music for the forthcoming seventh album, but as far as a release date she could only state it would be \"sometime in 2017\".<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=goldfrapp |number=624493201945182208 |title=It'll be a long time though before we release something, but I'll keep you posted when I can with stuff}}</ref> in December 2016 Goldfrapp posted on their [[Instagram]] page the covers of their first six studio albums.
