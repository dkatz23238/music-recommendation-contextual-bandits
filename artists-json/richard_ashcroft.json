He was the lead singer and occasional rhythm guitarist of the [[alternative rock]] band [[The Verve]] from their formation in 1990 until their original split in 1999. Songs he wrote for the band include \"[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]\", \"[[Lucky Man (The Verve song)|Lucky Man]]\", and the UK number one \"[[The Drugs Don't Work]]\". He became a successful solo artist, releasing three UK top three solo albums. The Verve reformed in 2007 but again broke up by summer 2009. Ashcroft then founded a new band, [[RPA & The United Nations of Sound]], and released a new album on 19 July 2010. Ashcroft released his fourth solo album, ''These People'', on 20 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://richardashcroft.com/|title=Richard Ashcroft |publisher=Richard Ashcroft|date=22 February 2016|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref> Ashcroft went on to release the album \u201cNatural Rebel\u201d in 2018, and the compilation of acoustic versions of his best hits: \u201cAcoustic Hymns Vol.1\u201d in 2021.\n\nIn May 2019, Ashcroft received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Bittersweet Symphony dispute is over |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48380600 |access-date=23 May 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref> [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]] has described Ashcroft as \"the best singer in the world\".<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.gigwise.com/news/14747/richard-ashcroft-married-to-chris-martin | title= Richard Ashcroft 'Married' To Chris Martin | work=Gigwise | date=19 March 2006 | access-date=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nAshcroft was the only son of office worker Frank and hairdresser Louise Ashcroft (n\u00e9e Baxter); he also has two younger sisters.<ref name=\"musicsaves.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/36.shtml |title=Follow the Yellow Brick Road |publisher=Musicsaves.org |access-date=18 January 2012}}</ref> His middle name, Paul, is also the name of a paternal uncle.
