Professional [[archivist]]s and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal, commercial, administrative, or social activities. They have been metaphorically defined as \"the secretions of an organism\",<ref>{{cite book |first=V. H. |last=Galbraith |author-link=Vivian Hunter Galbraith |title=Studies in the Public Records |place=London |year=1948 |page=3 }}</ref> and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity.\n\nIn general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines of which many identical copies may exist. This means that archives are quite distinct from [[Library|libraries]] with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|access-date=7 December 2012|publisher=Society of American Archivists|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615035638/http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|archive-date=15 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nA person who works in archives is called an [[archivist]].

Archaeologists have discovered archives of hundreds (and sometime thousands) of clay tablets going back to the third and second millennia BC in sites like [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Amarna]], [[Hattusas]], [[Ugarit]], and [[Pylos]]. These discoveries have been fundamental to learning about ancient alphabets, languages, literature, and politics.\n\nArchives were well developed by the ancient Chinese, the ancient Greeks, and ancient Romans (who called them ''[[Tabularium|Tabularia]]''). However, those archives have been lost, since documents written on materials like [[papyrus]] and paper deteriorated relatively quickly, unlike their clay tablet counterparts. Archives of churches, kingdoms, and cities from the Middle Ages survive and have often kept their official status uninterruptedly to the present. They are the basic tool for historical research on this period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|page=7}}</ref>\n\nEngland after 1066 developed archives and archival access methods.<ref>Michael T.

Due to the massive size of the Web, web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated collection.\n\nSimilarly, software code and documentation can be archived on the web, as with the example of [[CPAN]].\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Tretter Collection, QSCC Files.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Jean-Nickolaus Tretter Collection in Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Studies in May 2013]]\nSome archives defy categorization.  There are tribal archives within the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] nations in North America, and there are archives that exist within the papers of private individuals.  Many museums keep archives in order to prove the [[provenance]] of their pieces.  Any institution or persons wishing to keep their significant papers in an organized fashion that employs the most basic principles of [[archival science]] may have an archive.  In the 2004 census of archivists taken in the United States, 2.7% of archivists were employed in institutions that defied categorization.  This was a separate figure from the 1.3% that identified themselves as self-employed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walch |first=Victoria Irons |year=2006 |title=A*Census: A Closer Look|journal=The American Archivist |volume=69 |issue= 2|pages=327\u2013348|url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census| access-date=8 May 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405071939/http://www.archivists.org/a-census| archive-date= 5 April 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of archive is the Public Secrets project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicsecret.net/|title=Public Secrets}}</ref> This is an interactive testimonial, in which women incarcerated in the California State Prison System describe what happened to them. The archive's mission is to gather stories from women who want to express themselves, and want their stories heard. This collection includes transcripts and an audio recording of the women telling their stories.\n\nThe archives of an individual may include letters, papers, photographs, computer files, scrapbooks, financial records, or diaries created or collected by the individual \u2013 regardless of medium or format. The archives of an organization (such as a corporation or government) tend to contain other types of records, such as administrative files, business records, memos, official correspondence, and meeting minutes. Some archives are made up of a compilation of both types of collections. An example of this type of combined compilation is The [[Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria]] which contain a multitude of collections of donations from both individuals and organizations from all over the world. Many of these donations have yet to be cataloged, but are currently in the process of being [[Digital preservation|digitally preserved]] and made available to the public online.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Transgender Archives - University of Victoria|url=https://www.uvic.ca/transgenderarchives/|access-date=2021-02-06|website=www.uvic.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Arctic World Archive]] is a commercially-run facility for data preservation located in the [[Svalbard]] archipelago, Norway, which contains data of historical and cultural interest from several countries, as well as all of American multinational company [[GitHub]]'s [[open source code]].

International partners for archives are [[UNESCO]] and [[Blue Shield International]] in accordance with the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property from 1954 and its 2nd Protocol from 1999. From a national and international perspective, there are many collaborations between archives and local Blue Shield organizations to ensure the sustainable existence of cultural property storage facilities. In addition to working with the [[United Nations peacekeeping]] in the event of war, the protection of the archives requires the creation of \"no strike lists\", the linking of civil and military structures and the training of local personnel.<ref>Roger O\u2019Keefe, Camille P\u00e9ron, Tofig Musayev, Gianluca Ferrari: Protection of Cultural Property.
