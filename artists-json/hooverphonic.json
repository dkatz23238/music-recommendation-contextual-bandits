Though originally categorized as a [[trip hop]] group, they quickly expanded their sound to the point where they could no longer be described as a singular genre, but rather encompass [[Alternative rock|alternative]], [[electronica]], [[electropop]], [[Rock music|rock]], and a mixture of others. The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the [[The Hoover Company|vacuum cleaner company]].\n\nSince their formation, Hooverphonic's lineup consisted of bassist [[Alex Callier]], guitarist Raymond Geerts, and various lead singers. Prominent ones included [[Liesje Sadonius]] (1996\u20131997), [[Geike Arnaert]] (1997\u20132008, 2020\u2013present), [[No\u00e9mie Wolfs]] (2010\u20132015), and Luka Cruysberghs (2018\u20132020).\n\nThe band were set to represent {{Esccnty|Belgium|y=2020}} at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2020]] in [[Rotterdam]] with their song \"[[Release Me (Hooverphonic song)|Release Me]]\".<ref name=vrt>{{cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/10/01/hooverphonic-naar-het-songfestival-voor-belgie/|title=Belgium: Hooverphonic to Eurovision 2020|first=Neil|last=Farren|date=1 October 2019|website=Eurovoix|access-date=1 October 2019|archive-date=15 October 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015205401/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/10/01/hooverphonic-naar-het-songfestival-voor-belgie/}}</ref> However, on March 18, 2020, the event was cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. They instead represented Belgium in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2021]] with the song \"[[The Wrong Place]]\".\n\n== History ==\n\n=== ''A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular'' ===\nThe original members of the group were vocalist Esther Lybeert, keyboardist Frank Duch\u00eane, bassist [[Alex Callier]], and guitarist Raymond Geerts. Lybeert recorded several demos with the group; however, she backed out of the band on the day they were to sign their contract with Sony Music.<ref name=\"CallierInterview1\">{{cite video |people=Callier, Alex |year=2005 |title=10 Years With Hooverphonic - Alex Callier Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGeGq6ab2U | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/IPGeGq6ab2U| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|medium=television interview |language=nl |publisher=\u00eb\u00ebn |access-date=29 November 2012 |time=1:47 |quote=In fact the demos were done by Esther. She also did all the showcases and on the day we had to sign our record contract at Sony Music she said: \"I don't think I can do this...\"}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The band then brought in [[Liesje Sadonius]] to record the album. Sadonius left Hooverphonic on amicable terms shortly after the release of ''[[A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular]]''. Kyoko Baertsoen, singer for fellow Belgian trip hop band [[Lunascape (Belgian band)|Lunascape]], filled in for Sadonius for three months of a European tour in 1997 before [[Geike Arnaert]] was made the permanent singer later that year.<ref name=\"CallierInterview1\" />\n\nThe band achieved international recognition through the inclusion of the ''Stereophonic'' track \"2Wicky\" on the soundtrack to [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s 1996 film ''[[Stealing Beauty]]''. \"2Wicky\" also appeared on the soundtracks of ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' and ''[[Heights (film)|Heights]]''. The track's main riff is [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] from [[Isaac Hayes]]' recording of the 1960s hit \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\".\n\nAdditional session musicians for ''Stereophonic'' include Eric Bosteels, a session drummer with Hooverphonic from 1997 to 1998 (replaced by Mario Goossens until 2005) and David Poltrock, a keyboard player with the group on and off from 1998 until 2005. In 1998, Hooverphonic also contributed to the [[Depeche Mode]] tribute album ''[[For the Masses]]'' with their cover of \"[[Shake the Disease]]\".\n\n=== ''Blue Wonder Power Milk'' ===\nAfter an extensive European tour with artists such as [[Massive Attack]], [[Morcheeba]], and [[Apollo 440]], and a tour opening for [[Fiona Apple]] in the United States in 1997, the band released ''[[Blue Wonder Power Milk]]'' in 1998 with 18-year-old Arnaert on vocals. A marked departure from their debut, the album is driven less by breakbeats and samples, and more by organic string elements and traditional song structures.\n\nThe single \"Club Montepulciano\" was a hit in native Belgium and a minor college hit in the U.S., while \"Renaissance Affair\" was featured in the North American commercial campaign for the [[Volkswagen New Beetle#Trivia|new Volkswagen Vapor Beetle]]. \"[[This Strange Effect]]\" and \"[[Eden (Hooverphonic song)|Eden]]\" were both featured in American cell phone commercials: \"This Strange Effect\" for the [[Motorola SLVR L7|Motorola SLVR]], and in 2006, \"Eden\" for the [[Cingular 8525]]. \"Eden\" was also used in the 1998 slasher film ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]''. At the time of their release, both songs were also featured in two separate third-season episodes of ''[[La Femme Nikita (TV series)|La Femme Nikita]]''. Shortly afterwards, [[Sarah Brightman]] recorded a cover of \"Eden\" on her 1998 album ''[[Eden (Sarah Brightman album)|Eden]]''. [[Yoko Kanno]] samples the opening track \"Battersea\" in \"Cyberbird\", on the [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex O.S.T. 2|''Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex'' O.S.T. 2]].\n\nAt this point, Frank Duch\u00eane decided to quit the band: \u00abHaving made two successful albums for Sony Music with his band Hooverphonic, and after extensive touring as support for Fiona Apple, [[Moloko]] & Massive Attack, he was unhappy with the project and near the end of 1998, decided to leave.\u00bb<ref>[http://www.frankduchene.com/contact.htm Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419165057/http://www.frankduchene.com/contact.htm |date=2016-04-19 }}, Frank Duch\u00eane Website. Retrieved 10 April 2016.</ref>\n\n=== Early 2000s: ''The Magnificent Tree'' ===\nThe band followed up ''Blue Wonder Power Milk'' with 2000's ''[[The Magnificent Tree]]'', which expands on the sound of ''Milk'' with a warmer, more approachable sound.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Highlights from the album are the string-laden \"Out of Sight\", \"[[Mad About You (Hooverphonic song)|Mad About You]]\", and the title track.\n\nThe same year, Hooverphonic was asked to write a song specifically for the opening ceremony of the [[2000 European Football Championship]], which took place in [[Brussels]], Belgium. The result\u00a0\u2014 a 12-minute-long track called \"Visions\"\u00a0\u2014 became the theme song of the championship, and Hooverphonic's performance at the opening ceremony was heard/seen by more than 1 billion people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n\nOn the heels of ''Tree'''s success, the band became the first Belgian outfit to headline the Belgian [[Rock Werchter]] musical festival in 2001.\n\n=== 2002: ''Hooverphonic Presents Jackie Cane'' ===\n2002 saw the group shifting gears again, this time releasing the [[concept album]] ''[[Hooverphonic Presents Jackie Cane]]''. The album tells the story of the fictional title character, a celebrity and singer catapulted into stardom at the expense of her relationship with her twin sister. Driven to the brink of insanity by the pressures of fame, Jackie quits show business and returns home to attempt reconciliation, where her sister kills them both with a poisoned last supper.\n\n''Jackie Cane'' retains the dreamy elements of Hooverphonic's previous works, most notably on songs \"Nirvana Blue\" and \"Human Interest\" (which contains references to \"[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]\" by [[Pink Floyd]]), but tracks like \"[[The World Is Mine (Hooverphonic song)|The World Is Mine]]\" (the first single) and \"Day After Day\" have a clear [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] influence and quality to them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The album went platinum in Belgium and won the group [[Zamu Music Awards|ZAMU]]\u2019s Best Pop/Rock Band and Best Album awards in 2002.\n\n=== 2003: ''Sit Down and Listen to Hooverphonic'' ===\nIn 2003, the band released an album performed live in a studio with an orchestra entitled ''[[Sit Down and Listen to Hooverphonic]]'', featuring a selection of songs from the band\u2019s body of work, as well as the new songs \"Antarctica\" and \"The Last Thing I Need Is You\", and a cover of [[Lee Hazlewood]]'s \"My Autumn\u2019s Done Come\". The band launched into an extended European tour in September 2003, performing in over 100 concert halls.\n\n=== 2005: ''No More Sweet Music'' ===\nThe band's fifth studio album, a double CD entitled ''[[No More Sweet Music|No More Sweet Music/More Sweet Music]]'', was released in December 2005. Both CDs include the same 11 tracks, however, they are all different versions.\n\n=== 2006: ''Singles '96-'06'' ===\nIn 2006 the band left Sony/BMG, complaining of lack of label support for ''No More Sweet Music''. A [[greatest hits|best-of album]] (''[[Singles '96 - '06]]'') was released to end the relation with Sony/BMG. The band went on to work without a label.\n\n=== 2007\u20142008: ''The President of the LSD Golf Club'' ===\n[[File:Geike Arnaert (Hooverphonic).jpg|thumb|right|[[Geike Arnaert]] of Hooverphonic in the Effenaar in Eindhoven on 24 January 2008.]]\nIn an interview for the Spanish TV program ''Nosolomusica'', Alex Callier gave some hints of a new, more psychedelic orientation for the band's forthcoming music. During a show in Moscow (October 2007), the band revealed the first single of the new album, \"[[Expedition Impossible (song)|Expedition Impossible]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tngzeajrco4 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/Tngzeajrco4| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=Hooverphonic - Expedition Impossible (Live @ B-2 / Moscow) |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2014-03-07}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n''[[The President of the LSD Golf Club]]'' was released in October 2007 in Belgium and the Netherlands.
