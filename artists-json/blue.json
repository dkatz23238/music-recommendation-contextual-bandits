The eye perceives blue when observing light with a [[dominant wavelength]] between approximately 450 and 495 [[nanometre]]s. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; [[Azure (color)|azure]] contains some green, while [[ultramarine]] contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as [[Rayleigh scattering#Cause of the blue colour of the sky|Rayleigh scattering]]. An optical effect called [[Tyndall effect]] explains [[Eye color#Blue|blue eyes]]. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called [[aerial perspective]].\n\nBlue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone [[lapis lazuli]] was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the [[Renaissance]], to make the pigment [[ultramarine]], the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used [[cobalt blue]] to colour fine [[blue and white porcelain]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], European artists used it in the windows of [[cathedral]]s. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye [[woad]] until it was replaced by the finer [[indigo]] from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur''</ref>\n{{Short description|Primary colour between purple and green in the spectrum}}\n\nSurveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and occasionally with sadness.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=24}} In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=22}} The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm, and concentration.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=24}}\n\n==Etymology and linguistics==\nThe [[modern English]] word ''blue'' comes from [[Middle English]] {{Lang|enm|bleu}} or {{Lang|enm|blewe}}, from the [[Old French]] {{Lang|fro|bleu}}, a word of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin, related to the [[Old High German]] word {{Lang|goh|blao}} (meaning 'shimmering, lustrous').<ref name=\"Webster 1970\">''Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary'' (1970).</ref> In [[heraldry]], the word ''[[azure (heraldry)|azure]]'' is used for ''blue''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry |date=1987 |publisher=[[A & C Black|Alphabooks/A&C Black]] |isbn=978-0-906670-44-6 |editor-last=Friar |editor-first=Stephen |location=London |pages=40, 343}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and some other languages, there is no single word for blue, but rather different words for light blue ({{Lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439}}, {{Transliteration|ru|goluboj}}; {{Lang|es|Celeste}}) and dark blue ({{Lang|ru|\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439}}, {{Transliteration|ru|sinij}}; {{Lang|es|Azul}}). See [[Colour term]].\n\nSeveral languages, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Lakota language|Lakota Sioux]], use the same word to describe blue and green. For example, in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is {{Lang|vi|xanh}}. In Japanese, the word for blue ({{Lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9752#Japanese|\u9752]]}}, {{Transliteration|ja|ao}}) is often used for colours that English speakers would refer to as green, such as the colour of a [[traffic signal]] meaning \"go\". In Lakota, the word {{Lang|lkt|[[wikt:t\u021f\u00f3|t\u021f\u00f3]]}} is used for both blue and green, the two colours not being distinguished in older Lakota.

''The Principles of Optics.'' McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New York. 1932.</ref>\n\nIn painting and traditional [[colour theory]], blue is one of the three [[primary color|primary colours]] of pigments (red, yellow, blue), which can be mixed to form a wide [[gamut]] of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green. Mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark grey. From the Renaissance onward, painters used this system to create their colours. (See [[RYB colour model]].)\n\nThe RYB model was used for [[colour printing]] by [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]] as early as 1725. Later, printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink, put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper. This method could produce almost all the colours in the [[spectrum]] with reasonable accuracy.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:AdditiveColorMixing.svg|Additive colour mixing. The combination of [[primary colour]]s produces secondary colours where two overlap; the combination red, green, and blue each in full intensity makes white.\nFile:Closeup of pixels.JPG|Red, green, and blue [[subpixels]] on an [[LCD display]].\n</gallery>\n\nOn the [[HSL and HSV|HSV colour wheel]], the [[Complementary color|complement]] of blue is [[yellow]]; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of [[red]] and [[green]] light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory ([[RYB colour model|RYB]]) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour is considered to be [[orange (colour)|orange]] (based on the [[Munsell color system|Munsell colour wheel]]).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sandra Espinet |title=Glossary Term: Color wheel |url=http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html |access-date=25 June 2022 |website=Sanford-artedventures.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Laser]]s emitting in the blue region of the spectrum became widely available to the public in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445\u2013447&nbsp;nm [[laser diode]] technology.<ref name=\"laserglow\">{{Cite web |title=Laserglow \u2013 Blue, Red, Yellow, Green Lasers |url=http://www.laserglow.com/GPO |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916051206/http://www.laserglow.com/GPO |archive-date=16 September 2011 |access-date=20 September 2011 |website=Laserglow.com}}</ref> Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through [[DPSS]] which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, but still widely used by scientists for applications including [[optogenetics]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], and [[particle image velocimetry]], due to their superior beam quality.<ref name=\"laserglow2\">{{Cite web |title=Laserglow \u2013 Optogenetics |url=http://www.laserglow.com/page/optogenetics |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915023159/http://www.laserglow.com/page/optogenetics |archive-date=15 September 2011 |access-date=20 September 2011 |website=Laserglow.com}}</ref> Blue [[gas laser]]s are also still commonly used for [[holography]], [[DNA sequencing]], [[optical pumping]], among other scientific and medical applications.\n\n==Shades and variations==\n[[File:Color icon blue.png|thumb|Various [[shades of blue]]]]\n{{Main|Shades of blue}}\nBlue is the colour of light between [[Violet (color)|violet]] and [[cyan]] on the [[visible spectrum]]. Hues of blue include indigo and [[ultramarine]], closer to violet; pure blue, without any mixture of other colours; Azure, which is a lighter shade of blue, similar to the colour of the sky; Cyan, which is midway in the spectrum between blue and [[green]], and the other blue-greens such as [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[teal]], and [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]].\n\nBlue also varies in shade or tint; darker shades of blue contain black or grey, while lighter tints contain white. Darker shades of blue include ultramarine, [[cobalt blue]], [[navy blue]], and [[Prussian blue]]; while lighter tints include [[sky blue]], [[azure (color)|azure]], and [[Egyptian blue]]. (For a more complete list see the [[List of colors|List of colours]]).\n\n===As a structural colour===\n{{Further|Structural colouration}}\n\nIn nature, many blue phenomena arise from [[structural colouration]], the result of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of [[thin films]], combined with refraction as light enters and exits such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Diverse colours therefore appear despite the absence of colourants.<ref name=\"ExeterIridescence\">{{Cite web |date=September 1998 |title=Iridescence in Lepidoptera |url=http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/emag/themes/natural-photonics/iridescenceinlepidoptera/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082122/http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/emag/themes/natural-photonics/iridescenceinlepidoptera/ |archive-date=7 April 2014 |access-date=27 April 2012 |website=Natural Photonics (originally in Physics Review Magazine) |publisher=University of Exeter}}</ref>\n\n==Colourants==\n{{Main|Colourants}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:Egyptian blue.jpg|[[Egyptian blue]]\nFile:Cobalt Blue.JPG|[[Cobalt blue]].\nFile:Bleu phtalo.jpg|[[Copper phthalocyanine]].\nFile:YInMn_Blue_-_cropped.jpg|[[YInMn blue]].\nFile:Prussian blue.jpg|[[Prussian blue]], Fe{{su|p=III|b=4}}[Fe{{su|p=II}}([[Cyanide|CN]]){{su|b=6}}]{{su|b=3}}, is the blue of [[blueprint]]s.\n</gallery>\n\n===Artificial blues===\n[[Egyptian blue]], the first artificial pigment, was produced in the third millennium BC in Ancient Egypt. It is produced by heating pulverized sand, copper, and [[natron]]. It was used in tomb paintings and funereal objects to protect the dead in their afterlife. Prior to the 1700s, blue colourants for artwork were mainly based on lapis lazuli and the related mineral ultramarine. A breakthrough occurred in 1709 when German druggist and pigment maker [[Johann Jacob Diesbach]] discovered [[Prussian blue]]. The new blue arose from experiments involving heating dried blood with iron sulphides and was initially called Berliner Blau. By 1710 it was being used by the French painter [[Antoine Watteau]], and later his successor [[Nicolas Lancret]]. It became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper, and in the 19th century was widely used by French impressionist painters.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu \u2013 HIstoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;114\u201316</ref> Beginning in the 1820s, Prussian blue was imported into Japan through the port of [[Nagasaki]]. It was called ''bero-ai'', or Berlin blue, and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional Japanese blue pigment, ''ai-gami'', made from the [[dayflower]]. Prussian blue was used by both [[Hokusai]], in his wave paintings, and [[Hiroshige]].<ref>Roger Keyes, ''Japanese Woodblock Prints: A Catalogue of the Mary A. Ainsworth Collection'', R, Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College, 1984, p. 42, plate #140, p. 91 and catalogue entry #439, p. 185. for more on the story of Prussian blue in Japanese prints, see also the website of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.</ref>\n\nIn 1799 a French chemist, [[Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard]], made a synthetic cobalt blue pigment which became immensely popular with painters.\n\nIn 1824 the [[Societ\u00e9 pour l'Encouragement d'Industrie]] in France offered a prize for the invention of an artificial [[ultramarine]] which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli. The prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named Jean Baptiste Guimet, but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour. In 1828, another scientist, [[Christian Gmelin]] then a professor of chemistry in T\u00fcbingen, found the process and published his formula. This was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine, which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product.<ref>Maerz and Paul (1930). ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York: McGraw Hill p. 206</ref>\n\nIn 1878 German chemists synthesized [[Indigo dye|indigo]]. This product rapidly replaced natural indigo, wiping out vast farms growing indigo. It is now the blue of blue jeans. As the pace of [[organic chemistry]] accelerated, a succession of synthetic blue dyes were discovered including [[Indanthrone blue]], which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun, and [[copper phthalocyanine]].\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:The Blue Boy.jpg|[[The Blue Boy]] (1770), featuring lapis lazuli, indigo, and cobalt colourants,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Eight blue moments in art history |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/eight-blue-moments-art-history |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016130010/https://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/eight-blue-moments-art-history |archive-date=2018-10-16 |access-date=2018-10-16 |publisher=The Tate}}</ref>\nFile:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]] illustrates the use of [[Prussian blue]]\nFile:Indigoproduktion BASF 1890.JPG|A synthetic indigo dye factory in Germany in 1890.\n</gallery>\n\n===Dyes for textiles and food===\n[[File:Indigo skeletal.svg|thumb|right|Chemical structure of [[indigo dye]], a widely produced blue dye.

Of some practical importance, [[cobalt]] is used to make the deep blue glazes and glasses. It substitutes for [[silicon]] or [[Aluminium|aluminum]] ions in these materials. Cobalt is the blue [[chromophore]] in [[Stained glass|stained glass windows]], such as those in [[Gothic cathedrals and churches|Gothic cathedrals]] and in Chinese [[porcelain]] beginning in the [[T'ang Dynasty]]. [[Copper#Compounds|Copper(II)]] (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) also produces many blue compounds, including the commercial [[Algaecide|algicide]] [[copper(II) sulfate]] (CuSO<sub>4</sub><sup>.</sup>5H<sub>2</sub>O).
