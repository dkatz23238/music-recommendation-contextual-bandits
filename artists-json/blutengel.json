The lyrics are written primarily in German and English and are presented with male and female vocals. The themes of the songs usually centre around themes common in [[Gothic fiction]] such as love, [[vampirism]], sexual fetishism, death, and [[immortality]]. The band calls their musical style ''dark pop''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blutengel.de/2016/06/ |title=Blutengel &#124; 2016 Juni |website=Blutengel.de |date=2016-07-30 |accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Formation and early years (1998\u20132001)===\nBlutengel was formed in 1998 after Chris Pohl had decided to give up the preceding project, [[Seelenkrank]] (which had released two albums), due to contractual problems. Just as its predecessor, Blutengel uses melodious electronic tunes in combination with both male and female voices. The lyrics are primarily in German or English and mixed between male and female vocals paired with electronic sounds and with songs often focusing on all aspects of love, from the tragedy of hopeless romance of vampires (all the way to the more animal aspects of desire) and aspects of death and the afterlife.\n\nThe first album ''[[Child of Glass (Blutengel album)|Child of Glass]]'' was released in early 1999 with [[Kati Roloff]] and [[Nina Bendigkeit]] as the original female vocalists.\n\nIn 2001, the second album ''[[Seelenschmerz]]'' was released. Nina left to concentrate on photography and eventually form the band Formalin. [[Gini Martin]] joined the band as the second female voice alongside Kati. The first Blutengel gig ever took place at the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] on June 1, 2001, in Leipzig, in front of 10,000 fans.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} At the end of 2001, the single ''Black Roses'' was released with [[:de:Constance Rudert|Constance Rudert]] as a session singer. The band performed at the Dark Storm Festival where Constance appeared on stage with Kati and Gini. This was the last time the band would play with its original line-up. Kati and Gini left the band days later for personal reasons and founded their own project together, [[Tristesse de la Lune]]. Constance, who had originally only been recruited for the single \"Black Roses\", became a full time member of Blutengel.
