Her second and third albums, ''[[My Truth]]'' (1999) and ''[[Don't Stop the Music (Robyn album)|Don't Stop the Music]]'' (2002), were released in Sweden.\n\nRobyn returned to international success with her fourth album, ''[[Robyn (album)|Robyn]]'' (2005), which brought a [[Grammy Award]] nomination. The album spawned the singles \"[[Be Mine! (Robyn song)|Be Mine!]]\" and the [[UK singles chart|UK]] number one \"[[With Every Heartbeat]]\". Robyn released a trilogy of mini-albums in 2010, known as the ''[[Body Talk (Robyn album)|Body Talk]]'' series. They received broad critical praise, three Grammy Award nominations, and produced three top-10 singles: \"[[Dancing On My Own]]\", \"[[Hang with Me]]\" and \"[[Indestructible (Robyn song)|Indestructible]]\". Robyn followed this with two collaborative EPs: ''[[Do It Again (EP)|Do It Again]]'' (2014) with [[R\u00f6yksopp]], and ''[[Love Is Free (album)|Love Is Free]]'' (2015) with [[Robyn & La Bagatelle Magique|La Bagatelle Magique]].

Later that year, Robyn's Swedish breakthrough came with the single \"[[Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)]]\". The singles became part of the album ''[[Robyn Is Here]]'', which was released in October 1995. Robyn also contributed vocals to Blacknuss' 1996 single, \"Roll with Me.\" She entered Sweden's pre-selection for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997]] as co-writer and producer of \"[[Du g\u00f6r mig hel igen]]\" (\"You Make Me Whole Again\"), which was performed by [[Cajsalisa Ejemyr]]. In [[Melodifestivalen 1997]], the song finished fourth.\n\nRobyn's US breakthrough came in late 1997, when the [[dance-pop]]/[[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singles \"[[Show Me Love (Robyn song)|Show Me Love]]\" and \"[[Do You Know (What It Takes)]]\" reached the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. She performed \"Show Me Love\" on the American children's show ''[[All That]]'' that year, and the songs also performed well in the UK. Robyn re-released \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\" internationally, but it was less successful than the other releases. It was ineligible for the US charts because there was no retail single available, but it reached number 32 on the [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart. \"Show Me Love\" was featured in the 1998 [[Lukas Moodysson]] film, ''[[Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l]]'', and the song's title was used as the title of the film in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries. As Robyn's popularity grew internationally, she was diagnosed with [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] and returned to Sweden to recover.\n\n=== 1999\u20132004: ''My Truth'' and ''Don't Stop the Music'' ===\n[[File:Robyn-Gatufesten2003.jpg|thumb|alt=Robyn onstage in an off-the-shoulder blue outfit|On tour in 2003]]\nRobyn's second album, ''[[My Truth]]'', was released in Sweden in May 1999 and subsequently in Europe. The single, \"[[Electric (Robyn song)|Electric]]\", was a commercial success and propelled ''My Truth'' to the number-two position in Sweden. The autobiographical album included the tracks, \"Universal Woman\" and \"Giving You Back\". Despite her US success with ''[[Robyn Is Here]]'', ''My Truth'' was not released in that country, partly because it included two songs which referenced an abortion she had in her teens.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DxUEAAAAMBAJ&q=robyn+billboard+2000&pg=PA95 |title= Sweden's Robyn Returns With Zomba/Jive Deal|first= Chuck|last= taylor|work= Billboard magazine|date= 2001-07-21|access-date=2 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/arts/music/robyn-honey-interview.html|title=How Robyn, Pop's Glittery Rebel, Danced Her Way Back From Darkness|last=Ganz|first=Caryn|date=2018-09-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/31/robyn-and-royksopp-do-it-again|title=R\u00f6yskopp and Robyn: 'We decided, let's not be afraid of being pretentious'|last=Hutchinson|first=Kate|date=2014-05-31|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-05-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Robyn contributed to [[Christian Falk]]'s 1999 debut solo album, ''Quel Bordel'' (''What a Mess''), appearing on \"Remember\" and \"Celebration\".

The title track was later covered by the Swedish girl group [[Play (band)|Play]], and the lead single (\"Keep This Fire Burning\") was covered by the British soul singer [[Beverley Knight]]. In May 2004, ''Robyn's Best'' was released in the US. It was a condensed version of her debut album, with no material from her later releases. In 2006, after her departure from BMG, ''Det B\u00e4sta Med Robyn'' (''The Best of Robyn'') was released in Sweden with material from her first three albums; notable omissions, however, were the singles \"Don't Stop the Music\" and \"Keep This Fire Burning\".\n\n=== 2004\u20132008: Konichiwa Records and ''Robyn'' ===\nThe decade-long relationship between Robyn and her label ended in 2004. When Jive Records reacted negatively to \"[[Who's That Girl (Robyn song)|Who's That Girl?]]{{\"'}}s new [[electropop]] sound, the singer decided to release music on her own.

(Robyn song)|Be Mine!]]\" in March 2005. Her fourth album, ''[[Robyn (album)|Robyn]]'', was her first number-one album in Sweden when it was released a month later. Influenced by electronica, rap, R&B and [[new-age music]], ''Robyn'' was critically praised and earned the singer three 2006 Swedish Grammy Awards: \"\u00c5rets Album\" (Best Album), \"\u00c5rets Komposit\u00f6r\" (Best Writer, with Klas \u00c5hlund) and \"\u00c5rets Pop Kvinnlig\" (Best Pop Female). The album evoked global interest in Robyn, who was recognized for co-writing the song \"Money for Nothing\" for [[Darin Zanyar]] (his debut single). She released three more singles\u2014\"Who's That Girl?\", \"[[Handle Me]]\" and \"[[Crash and Burn Girl]]\"\u2014from the eponymous LP, which was popular in Sweden. Robyn appeared on the [[Basement Jaxx]] track \"Hey U\" from their 2006 album, ''[[Crazy Itch Radio]]'', and contributed \"[[Dream On (Christian Falk song)|Dream On]]\" and \"C.C.C\" to [[Christian Falk]]'s ''People Say'' (his second album) that year. In December 2006, Robyn released ''[[The Rakamonie EP]]'' in the UK as a preview of her more-recent material; this was followed by the March 2007 release of \"[[Konichiwa Bitches]]\". A revised edition of ''Robyn'' was released in the UK the following month, with two new tracks\u2014\"[[With Every Heartbeat]]\" (a collaboration with [[Kleerup]]) and \"[[Cobrastyle]]\" (a cover of a 2006 single by Swedish rockers [[Teddybears (band)|Teddybears]])\u2014with slightly-altered versions of the original music.\n\nThe second single from the UK release was \"With Every Heartbeat\", which was released in late July 2007 and reached number one on the UK singles chart. Robyn appeared on [[Jo Whiley]]'s [[BBC Radio 1]] showcase show, ''[[Live Lounge]]''. In Australia, where ''Robyn'' reached the top ten of the [[iTunes Store]]'s album chart, \"With Every Heartbeat\" received attention on radio and video networks. Robyn contributed vocals to [[Fleshquartet]]'s single, \"This One's for You\", from their ''Voices of Eden'' album that year. Konichiwa Records signed an international licensing deal with [[Universal Music Group]] to distribute Robyn's music globally, and her UK recordings are released by [[Island Records]]. ''The Rakamonie EP'' was released in January 2008 by [[Cherrytree Records]] (a subsidiary of [[Interscope Records]]), and the US version of ''Robyn'' was released in April of that year. \"With Every Heartbeat\", \"Handle Me\" and \"Cobrastyle\" were top-10 club singles, and \"With Every Heartbeat\" received airplay on US pop and dance radio stations. Robyn provided backing vocals on [[Britney Spears]]' 2007 single, \"[[Piece of Me (Britney Spears song)|Piece of Me]]\", and appeared on the Fyre Department remix of \"[[Sexual Eruption]]\" by rapper [[Snoop Dogg]].
