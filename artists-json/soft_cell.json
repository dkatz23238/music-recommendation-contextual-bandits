Their initial efforts at recording resulted in an EP titled ''[[Mutant Moments]]'' , released in 1980 and which was funded by a loan of \u00a32,000 from Dave Ball's mother and made with a simple 2-track recorder.<ref name=\"book\">Almond, Marc (1999).

The duo ultimately signed to the Some Bizzare label, backed by [[Phonogram Records]]. Their first single, \"A Man Could Get Lost\" b/w \"Memorabilia\" on 7\" and \"Memorabilia\" b/w \"Persuasion\" on 12\", was produced by [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] who founded [[Mute Records]], \"Memorabilia\" was a success in nightclubs, but did not enter the UK singles chart.<ref name=\"thequietus.com\">{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/30878-soft-cell-non-stop-erotic-cabaret-oral-history-dave-ball-marc-almond-interview|title = The Quietus &#124; Features &#124; Anniversary &#124; Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret: An Oral History of Soft Cell's Debut Album}}</ref>\n\n===\"Tainted Love\"===\n{{see also|Tainted Love}}\nAfter the chart failure of \"Memorabilia\", [[Phonogram Records]] allowed Soft Cell to record a second and final single in an attempt to score a chart success. The band opted to record a cover version of \"Tainted Love\", an obscure 1965 [[northern soul]] track originally released by [[Gloria Jones]] (the girlfriend of [[Marc Bolan]] at the time of his death) and written by [[Ed Cobb]] of [[The Four Preps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/3780262-Gloria-Jones-Tainted-Love|title = Gloria Jones - Tainted Love|website = [[Discogs]]}}</ref>\n\nReleased in 1981, Soft Cell's \"Tainted Love\" was a No.&nbsp;1 hit in 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it was the second best selling single  of 1981<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-50-best-selling-songs-of-1981__32604/|title=The Official Top 50 best-selling songs of 1981|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref><ref name=\"UK Chart\"/> after selling 1.05 million copies (a total which increased to 1.35 million copies by of August 2017).<ref name=\"UK Chart\">{{cite news|url= http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/official-charts-flashback-1981-soft-cell-tainted-love__20296/|title=Official Charts Flashback 1981: Soft Cell - Tainted Love|last=Copsey|first=Rob|website=Officialcharts.com|date=31 August 2017|access-date=31 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, \"Tainted Love\" became a No.&nbsp;8 single in the United States and went on to set a [[Guinness World Record]] at the time for the longest consecutive stay (43 weeks) on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The song's popularity developed slowly, needing 19 weeks to enter the US Top 40. The A-side of the [[12-inch single]] of \"Tainted Love\" actually featured a two-song medley, with \"Tainted Love\" blending into the [[Motown]] classic \"[[Where Did Our Love Go]]\" (originally recorded by [[the Supremes]] in 1964).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/11282/supremes/|title = The Supremes &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website = [[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]]}}</ref>\n\n===''Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret''===\nThe duo's first album, ''[[Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret]]'', hit UK No.&nbsp;5 and further explored the now-trademark Soft Cell themes of squalor and sleaze. \"Seedy Films\" talks of long nights in [[pornography|porno]] cinemas, while \"Frustration\" and \"Secret Life\" deal with the boredom and hypocrisy associated with suburban life. A companion video titled ''[[Soft Cell's: Non-Stop Exotic Video Show|Non-Stop Exotic Video Show]]'' was released in 1982 and featured videos directed by [[Tim Pope]]. The video generated some controversy in Britain, mainly due to a scandal involved with the \"Sex Dwarf\" clip.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/heres-why-soft-cells-38-year-old-video-is-still-banned-as-marc-almond-discusses-shocking-sex-dwarf-2450261|title = Marc Almond discusses Soft Cell's shocking 'Sex Dwarf' video, which remains banned after 38 years|website = [[NME]]|date = 20 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"thequietus.com\"/>\n\n''[[Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret]]'' garnered two additional hits: \"[[Bedsitter (song)|Bedsitter]]\" dealt with the loneliness and lifestyle of a young man having recently left home to live in a [[bedsit]] while partying hard. \"Bedsitter\" reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1981. The song was highly acclaimed in a retrospective review by [[AllMusic]] journalist Ned Raggett who wrote that it \"ranks as one of the best, most realistic portrayals of urban life recorded.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Raggett |first=Ned |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/bedsitter-mt0026800785 |title=Bedsitter \u2013 Soft Cell &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=25 July 2014}}</ref> The final single on the album, the ballad \"[[Say Hello, Wave Goodbye]]\", peaked at No. 3 in February 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/19156/soft-cell/|title=Soft Cell &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1982, the duo spent most of their time recording and relaxing in New York City, where they met a woman named Cindy Ecstasy whom Almond would later confirm was his drug supplier (it was Cindy Ecstasy who introduced them to the new nightclub drug of the same name). Soon after \"Say Hello Wave Goodbye\" dropped out of the chart, Soft Cell released a brand new song: [[Torch (song)|\"Torch\"]], a love song which was to prove the closest the band ever got to having a No. 1 hit with one of their own songs. The song entered straight into the Top 20 and peaked at No. 2.<ref name=\"test\">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/ |title=UK Top 40 Chart Archive, British Singles & Album Charts |website=Everyhit.com |date=16 March 2000 |access-date=25 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1982, as was the trend at the time, the duo released a mini album titled ''[[Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing]]'', containing remixes of older material along with their new single, \"What!\". This was a cover of the 1965 song by [[Melinda Marx]]. It was later covered in 1968 by [[Judy Street]], whose version became extremely popular on the Northern Soul scene.\"What!\" was a major hit in the UK and reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart in August of that year.<ref name=\"test\"/>\n\n===Decline and dissolution===\nBy 1983, fame and nearly constant drug use were having a bad effect on the duo. Marc Almond also formed the group [[Marc and the Mambas]], featuring collaborations with [[The The]]'s [[Matt Johnson (singer)|Matt Johnson]] and future Almond collaborator Annie Hogan, as an [[Spin-off (media)|offshoot]] to experiment out of the glare of the Soft Cell spotlight. Soft Cell's third album release, appropriately titled ''[[The Art of Falling Apart]]'', was a Top 5 hit in the UK but the singles were only modest successes. The first single \"Where The Heart Is\" only reached 21, while the double A-side \"Numbers\"/\"Barriers\" peaked at 25. \"Numbers\" also generated controversy due to references in the song to the drug [[methamphetamine|speed]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/master/17695-Soft-Cell-Numbers-Barriers|title=Soft Cell - Numbers / Barriers|website=[[Discogs]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wifes |first=Readers |url=http://www.polarimagazine.com/lgbt-history-month/numbers-soft-cell/ |title=LGBT History Month &#124; UK &#124; Significant LGBT Song of the Day &#124; Soft Cell &#124; Numbers |publisher=polarimagazine.com |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2022-08-27}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1983, the duo released a new single \"Soul Inside\", which returned them to the UK Top 20, but by early 1984 the duo had amicably decided to end Soft Cell. They played farewell concerts at [[Hammersmith Palais]] in January, and released one final album called ''[[This Last Night in Sodom]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;12) in March. The album's second and final single \"Down in the Subway\" (UK No.&nbsp;24), had already been released in February 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marcalmond.co.uk/history/discography.html|title = Marc Almond Discography}}</ref>\n\n===Reunions===\nAlmond and Ball reunited as Soft Cell in 2000 with a series of live dates. They performed at the opening of the Ocean nightclub in London during March 2001. A mini-tour followed later in the year. The track \"God Shaped Hole\" featured on the [[Some Bizzare]] compilation titled ''[[I'd Rather Shout at a Returning Echo than Kid Someone's Listening]]'', released during 2001. A new Soft Cell album, ''[[Cruelty Without Beauty]]'', was released during late 2002, followed by a European tour and a small US tour during early 2003. The second single from the album, a cover of [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]]{{'}} \"The Night\", reached No.&nbsp;39 in the UK. Soft Cell had considered recording \"The Night\" in place of \"Tainted Love\" during 1981, though keyboardist David Ball stated in a 2003 interview with the BBC, \"I think history has kind of shown that we did make the right choice [in 1981]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/20/how-we-made-tainted-love-mark-almond-dave-ball-interview|title=How we made Soft Cell's Tainted Love|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=20 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 they released an album compiling some of their early demo recordings called The Bedsit Tapes.
