Prior to the adoption of the current convention that includes mountain divides, the border between Europe and Asia had been redefined several times since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]], but always as a series of rivers, seas and straits that were believed to extend an unknown distance east and north from the Mediterranean Sea without the inclusion of any mountain ranges. Cartographer [[Herman Moll]] suggested in 1715 Europe was bounded by a series of partly-joined waterways directed towards the Turkish straits, and the [[Irtysh River]] draining into the upper part of the [[Ob River]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]]. In contrast, the present eastern boundary of Europe partially adheres to the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, which is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent compared to any clear-cut definition of the term \"continent\".\n\nThe current division of Eurasia into two continents now reflects [[East\u2013West dichotomy|East-West]] cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic border between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries and now only follows a few bodies of water. Turkey is generally considered a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental country]] divided entirely by water, while [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] are only partly divided by waterways. France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the [[United Kingdom]] are also transcontinental (or more properly, intercontinental, when oceans or large seas are involved) in that their main land areas are in Europe while pockets of their territories are located on other [[continents]] separated from Europe by large bodies of water. Spain, for example, has territories south of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]\u2014namely, [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]\u2014which are parts of [[Africa]] and share a border with Morocco. According to the current convention, Georgia and Azerbaijan are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents.\n\n===History of the concept===\n{{see also|Boundary between Europe and Asia}}\n\n====Early history====\n[[File:Europa Prima Pars Terrae in Forma Virginis.jpg|thumb|Depiction of ''[[Europa regina]]'' ('Queen Europe') in 1582|alt=|270x270px]]\nThe first recorded usage of ''Eur\u1e53p\u0113'' as a geographic term is in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Delian Apollo]], in reference to the western shore of the [[Aegean Sea]].

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]], the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (ancient [[Tanais]]). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga\u2013Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.\n\nAround 1715, [[Herman Moll]] produced a map showing the northern part of the [[Ob River]] and the [[Irtysh River]], a major tributary of the Ob, as components of a series of partly-joined waterways taking the boundary between Europe and Asia from the Turkish Straits, and the Don River all the way to the Arctic Ocean. In 1721, he produced a more up to date map that was easier to read. However, his proposal to adhere to major rivers as the line of demarcation was never taken up by other geographers who were beginning to move away from the idea of water boundaries as the only legitimate divides between Europe and Asia.\n\nFour years later, in 1725, [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary. He drew a new line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between the Volga and [[Ural River]]s), then north and east along the latter waterway to its source in the [[Ural Mountains]]. At this point he proposed that mountain ranges could be included as boundaries between continents as alternatives to nearby waterways. Accordingly, he drew the new boundary north along [[Ural Mountains]] rather than the nearby and parallel running Ob and Irtysh rivers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=de|page=106}}</ref> This was endorsed by the Russian Empire and introduced the convention that would eventually become commonly accepted. However, this did not come without criticism. [[Voltaire]], writing in 1760 about [[Peter the Great]]'s efforts to make Russia more European, ignored the whole boundary question with his claim that neither Russia, Scandinavia, northern Germany, nor Poland were fully part of Europe.<ref name=\"Pocock2002\"/> Since then, many modern analytical geographers like [[Halford Mackinder]] have declared that they see little validity in the Ural Mountains as a boundary between continents.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&pg=PA8|title=Europe: A History|page=8|access-date=23 August 2010|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|date=1996|last1=Davies|first1=Norman|archive-date=1 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801123242/https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&pg=PA8|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century.

The unsuccessful [[Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) weakened the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the [[Francia|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, which ended their northward advance. In the remote regions of north-western Iberia and the middle [[Pyrenees]] the power of the Muslims in the south was scarcely felt. It was here that the foundations of the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]], [[Kingdom of Leon|Leon]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] were laid and from where the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula would start. However, no coordinated attempt would be made to drive the [[Moors]] out. The Christian kingdoms were mainly focussed on their own internal power struggles. As a result, the [[Reconquista]] took the greater part of eight hundred years, in which period a long list of Alfonsos, Sanchos, Ordo\u00f1os, Ramiros, Fernandos and Bermudos would be fighting their Christian rivals as much as the Muslim invaders.\n[[File:Europe 843ad viking incursions map.png|thumb|250px|[[Viking]] raids and division of the Frankish Empire at the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843]]\n\nDuring the Dark Ages, the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell under the control of various tribes.

Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref>\nLand relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]] and [[Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]] and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, [[fjord]]-cut spine of Norway.\n\nThis description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until [[sea level rise|rising sea levels]] cut them off.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Europe}}\n[[File:Vegetation Europe.png|thumb|[[Biome]]s of Europe and surrounding regions:\n<br/>\n{{legend0|#9fd6c9|[[tundra]]}}\n{{legend0|#a7bddb|[[alpine tundra]]}}\n{{legend0|#006d64|[[taiga]]}}\n{{legend0|#3c9798|[[montane forest]]}} <br/>\n{{legend0|#a4e05d|[[temperate broadleaf forest]]}}\n{{legend0|#907699|[[mediterranean forest]]}}\n{{legend0|#f7ec6f|[[temperate steppe]]}}\n{{legend0|#9b8447|[[dry steppe]]}}\n]]\n\nEurope lies mainly in the [[temperate]] climate zones, being subjected to [[prevailing westerlies]].

The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nTherefore, the average temperature throughout the year of [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] is {{cvt|16|C}}, while it is only {{cvt|13|C}} in [[New York City]] which is almost on the same latitude, bordering the same ocean. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in far south-eastern Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around {{cvt|8|C-change}} higher than those in Calgary and they are almost {{cvt|22|C-change}} higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.<ref name=\"climate\"/>\n\nThe large water masses of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which equalise the temperatures on an annual and daily average, are also of particular importance. The water of the Mediterranean extends from the [[Sahara desert]] to the Alpine arc in its northernmost part of the [[Adriatic Sea]] near [[Trieste]].<ref>Josef Wasmayer \"Wetter- und Meereskunde der Adria\" (1976), pp 5.</ref>\n\nIn general, Europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south, but it also gets colder from the west towards the east. The climate is more oceanic in the west and less so in the east. This can be illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the 64th, 60th, 55th, 50th, 45th and 40th [[latitudes]]. None of them is located at high altitude; most of them are close to the sea.

Around 1.1&nbsp;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&nbsp;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the [[late Tertiary]] period about five million years ago.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |title=Europe |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |year=2007 |access-date=10 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204015044/https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |archive-date=4 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|access-date=9 June 2008|archive-date=11 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190811131707/http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref> Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].\n\nThe northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]] and so may be regarded geologically as the \"main continent\", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].\n\n===Flora===\n\n[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green) and tundra, or bogs, in the north (dark yellow)]]\n\nHaving lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.\n\nThe main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east\u2013west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south\u2013north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.\n[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|upright=1.2|thumb|Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer L\u00f6sch]]\nPossibly 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|access-date=9 June 2008|archive-date=6 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006131242/http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history%26geography.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf and mixed]] forests, [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2\u20133% or less, while in its Western Russia its 5\u201310%. The European country with the [[List of countries by forest area|smallest percentage of forested area]] is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe |publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal |page=182 |access-date=9 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190612/http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |archive-date=24 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]\u2013[[pine]]\u2013[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east\u2013west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends westwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.\n\n===Fauna===\n{{main|Fauna of Europe}}\n[[File:Europe biogeography countries.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of Europe and bordering regions]]\n\nGlaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bear]]s ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).\n\n[[File:Neandertal - Wisent.jpg|thumb|right|Once roaming the great temperate forests of Eurasia, [[European bison]] now live in nature preserves in [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest]], on the border between [[Poland]] and [[Belarus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/artiodactyla/bison_bonasus.html|title=European bison, Wisent|access-date=19 January 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226095419/http://www.ultimateungulate.com/artiodactyla/bison_bonasus.html|archive-date=26 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8182000/8182104.stm | work=BBC News | first=Matt | last=Walker | title=European bison on 'genetic brink' | date=4 August 2009 | access-date=30 July 2022 | archive-date=6 July 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220706045354/http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8182000/8182104.stm | url-status=live }}</ref>]]\n\nEuropean wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).\n\nImportant European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others.

Historically, special examples with overlapping cultures are [[Strasbourg]] with Latin (Romance) and Germanic or [[Trieste]] with Latin, Slavic and Germanic roots.\nCultural contacts and mixtures shape a large part of the regional cultures of Europe.
