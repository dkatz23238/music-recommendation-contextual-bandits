She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable [[diction]], phrasing, timing, [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], and a \"horn-like\" improvisational ability, particularly in her [[scat singing]].\n\nAfter a tumultuous adolescence, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the [[Chick Webb]] Orchestra, performing across the country but most often associated with the [[Savoy Ballroom]] in [[Harlem]]. Her rendition of the nursery rhyme \"[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]]\" helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career. Her manager was Moe Gale, co-founder of the Savoy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/the-savoy-ballroom-opens|title=The Savoy Ballroom opens |website=African American Registry|access-date=October 29, 2016}}</ref> until she turned the rest of her career over to [[Norman Granz]], who founded [[Verve Records]] to produce new records by Fitzgerald. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the [[Great American Songbook]].\n\nWhile Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], and [[The Ink Spots]] were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced some of her best-known songs such as \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\", \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\", \"[[Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall]]\", and \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\". In 1993, after a career of nearly 60 years, she gave her last public performance. Three years later, she died at the age of 79 after years of declining health. Her [[List of awards received by Ella Fitzgerald|accolades]] included 14 [[Grammy Awards]], the [[National Medal of Arts]], the [[NAACP]]'s inaugural [[NAACP Image Award \u2013 President's Award|President's Award]], and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].\n\n== Early life ==\nFitzgerald was born on April 25, 1917, in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellafitzgerald.com/about/biography|title=Biography|date=March 11, 2015|website=Ella Fitzgerald|access-date=December 21, 2018}}</ref> She was the daughter of William Fitzgerald and Temperance \"Tempie\" Henry, both described as \"[[mulatto]]\" in the 1920 census.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=4}} Her parents were unmarried but lived together in the [[East End section]] of Newport News<ref name=\"Whitaker 2011 p. 302\">{{cite book |last=Whitaker |first=Matthew |title=Icons of Black America: Breaking Barriers and Crossing Boundaries |publisher=Greenwood |location=Santa Barbara, CA, US |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-313-37643-6 |oclc=781709336 |page=302 |volume=v. 1 |url={{Google books|RSGhEUq5bp0C|page=302|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> for at least two and a half years after she was born.

The composers and lyricists spotlighted on each set, taken together, represent the greatest part of the cultural canon known as the ''[[Great American Songbook]]''. Her song selections ranged from standards to rarities and represented an attempt by Fitzgerald to cross over into a non-jazz audience. The sets are the most well-known items in her discography.\n[[File:Ella Fitzgerald 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Fitzgerald in 1968, courtesy of the [[Fraser MacPherson]] estate]]\n\n''[[Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Song Book]]'' was the only Song Book on which the composer she interpreted played with her. [[Duke Ellington]] and his longtime collaborator [[Billy Strayhorn]] both appeared on exactly half the set's 38 tracks and wrote two new pieces of music for the album: \"The E and D Blues\" and a four-movement musical portrait of Fitzgerald. The Song Book series ended up becoming the singer's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful work, and probably her most significant offering to American culture.

A later collection devoted to a single composer was released during her time with [[Pablo Records]], ''[[Ella Abra\u00e7a Jobim]]'', featuring the songs of [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]].\n\nWhile recording the Song Books and the occasional studio album, Fitzgerald toured 40 to 45 weeks per year in the United States and internationally, under the tutelage of Norman Granz. Granz helped solidify her position as one of the leading live jazz performers.<ref name=\"nyobit\" /> In 1961 Fitzgerald bought a house in the [[Klampenborg]] district of Copenhagen, Denmark, after she began a relationship with a Danish man. Though the relationship ended after a year, Fitzgerald regularly returned to Denmark over the next three years and even considered buying a jazz club there. The house was sold in 1963, and Fitzgerald permanently returned to the United States.{{sfn|Nicholson|1996|p=198}}\n\n[[File:Ella-Fitzgerald-in-Helsinki-1963.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald performing at the [[Helsinki Culture Hall]] in [[Helsinki, Finland]], in April 1963]]\n\nThere are several live albums on Verve that are highly regarded by critics. ''[[At the Opera House]]'' shows a typical Jazz at the Philharmonic set from Fitzgerald. ''[[Ella in Rome: The Birthday Concert|Ella in Rome]]'' and ''[[Twelve Nights in Hollywood]]'' display her vocal jazz canon. ''[[Ella in Berlin: Mack the Knife|Ella in Berlin]]'' is still one of her best-selling albums; it includes a Grammy-winning performance of \"[[Mack the Knife]]\" in which she forgets the lyrics but improvises magnificently to compensate.\n\nVerve Records was sold to [[MGM Records|MGM]] in 1960 for $3 million and in 1967 MGM failed to renew Fitzgerald's contract. Over the next five years she flitted between [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] and [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]. Her material at this time represented a departure from her typical jazz repertoire. For Capitol she recorded ''[[Brighten the Corner]]'', an album of [[hymn]]s, ''[[Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas]]'', an album of traditional [[Christmas carol]]s, ''[[Misty Blue (album)|Misty Blue]]'', a [[country and western]]-influenced album, and ''[[30 by Ella]]'', a series of six medleys that fulfilled her obligations for the label. During this period, she had her last US chart single with a cover of [[Smokey Robinson]]'s \"[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]\", previously a hit for [[the Temptations]], and some months later a top-five hit for [[Get Ready (The Temptations song)#Rare Earth version|Rare Earth]].\n\nThe surprise success of the 1972 album ''[[Jazz at Santa Monica Civic '72]]'' led Granz to found [[Pablo Records]], his first record label since the sale of Verve. Fitzgerald recorded some 20 albums for the label. ''[[Ella in London]]'' recorded live in 1974 with pianist [[Tommy Flanagan]], guitarist Joe Pass, bassist Keter Betts and drummer Bobby Durham, was considered by many to be some of her best work. The following year she again performed with Joe Pass on German television station [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] in [[Hamburg]]. Her years with Pablo Records also documented the decline in her voice. \"She frequently used shorter, stabbing phrases, and her voice was harder, with a wider vibrato\", one biographer wrote.<ref name=Nicholson>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2004}} ''\"For many years Fitzgerald's birthdate was thought to be on the same date one year later in 1918 \u2013 and it is still listed as such in some sources \u2013 but research by Nicholson and another biographer, Tanya Lee Stone, established 1917 as the correct year of birth.\"''</ref> Plagued by health problems, Fitzgerald made her last recording in 1991 and her last public performances in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506681/Sir-Johnny-up-there-with-the-Count-and-the-Duke.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506681/Sir-Johnny-up-there-with-the-Count-and-the-Duke.html |archive-date=January 11, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Sir Johnny up there with the Count and the Duke|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Hugh|last=Davies|date=December 31, 2005|access-date=March 16, 2007|location=London}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n== Film and television ==\n[[File:President Ronald Reagan and Ella Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|right|Fitzgerald shakes hands with [[President the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] after performing in the [[White House]], 1981]]\n\nIn her most notable screen role, Fitzgerald played the part of singer Maggie Jackson in [[Jack Webb]]'s 1955 jazz film ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (film)|Pete Kelly's Blues]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Movie of the week: Pete Kelly's Blues|magazine=Jet|date=August 25, 1955|page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62|access-date=February 23, 2014|issn=0021-5996}}</ref> The film costarred [[Janet Leigh]] and singer [[Peggy Lee]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Capua|first=Michelangelo|title=Janet Leigh: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRlfe8948H4C&pg=PA176|access-date=February 23, 2014|date=March 8, 2013 |publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-7022-8|page=176}}</ref> Even though she had already worked in the movies (she sang two songs in the 1942 [[Abbott and Costello]] film ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942 film)|Ride 'Em Cowboy]]''),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Furia|first1=Philip|last2=Patterson|first2=Laurie|title=The Songs of Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NVcYC2cHk4C&pg=PA174 |access-date=February 23, 2014|date=March 10, 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-979266-5|page=174}}</ref> she was \"delighted\" when Norman Granz negotiated the role for her, and, \"at the time ... considered her role in the [[Warner Brothers]] movie the biggest thing ever to have happened to her.\"<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /> Amid ''The New York Times'' pan of the film when it opened in August 1955, the reviewer wrote, \"About five minutes (out of ninety-five) suggest the picture this might have been.

It was directed by Leslie Woodhead and produced by Reggie Nadelson. It was released in the UK in 2019.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://jazzjournal.co.uk/2019/03/21/ella-fitzgerald-just-one-of-those-things/|title=Ella Fitzgerald: Just One of Those Things &#124; Jazz Journal|first=Sally|last=Evans-Darby|date=March 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Collaborations ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nFitzgerald's most famous collaborations were with the vocal quartet [[Bill Kenny (singer)|Bill Kenny]] & [[the Ink Spots]], trumpeter [[Louis Armstrong]], the guitarist [[Joe Pass]], and the bandleaders [[Count Basie]] and [[Duke Ellington]].\n* From 1943 to 1950, Fitzgerald recorded seven songs with the Ink Spots featuring Bill Kenny. Of the seven, four reached the top of the pop charts, including \"[[I'm Making Believe]]\" and \"[[Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall]],\" which both reached No. 1.\n* Fitzgerald recorded three Verve studio albums with Louis Armstrong, two albums of standards (1956's ''[[Ella and Louis]]'' and 1957's ''[[Ella and Louis Again]]''), and a third album featured music from the [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] opera ''[[Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)|Porgy and Bess]]''. Fitzgerald also recorded a number of sides with Armstrong for Decca in the early 1950s.\n* Fitzgerald is sometimes referred to as the quintessential swing singer, and her meetings with Count Basie are highly regarded by critics. Fitzgerald features on one track on Basie's 1957 album ''[[One O'Clock Jump (album)|One O'Clock Jump]]'', while her 1963 album ''[[Ella and Basie!]]'' is remembered as one of her greatest recordings. With the 'New Testament' Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a young [[Quincy Jones]], this album proved a respite from the 'Song Book' recordings and constant touring that Fitzgerald was engaged in during this period. Fitzgerald and Basie also collaborated on the 1972 album ''[[Jazz at Santa Monica Civic '72]]'', and on the 1979 albums ''[[Digital III at Montreux]]'', ''[[A Classy Pair]]'' and ''[[A Perfect Match (Ella Fitzgerald album)|A Perfect Match]]''.\n* Fitzgerald and Joe Pass recorded four albums together toward the end of Fitzgerald's career. She recorded several albums with piano accompaniment, but a guitar proved the perfect melodic foil for her. Fitzgerald and Pass appeared together on the albums ''[[Take Love Easy]]'' (1973), ''[[Easy Living (Ella Fitzgerald album)|Easy Living]]'' (1986), ''[[Speak Love]]'' (1983) and ''[[Fitzgerald and Pass... Again]]'' (1976).\n* Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington recorded two live albums and two studio albums. Her ''Duke Ellington Song Book'' placed Ellington firmly in the canon known as the Great American Songbook, and the 1960s saw Fitzgerald and the 'Duke' meet on the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] for the 1966 album ''[[Ella and Duke at the Cote D'Azur]]'', and in [[Sweden]] for ''[[The Stockholm Concert, 1966]]''. Their 1965 album ''[[Ella at Duke's Place]]'' is also extremely well received.\n\nFitzgerald had a number of famous jazz musicians and soloists as sidemen over her long career. The trumpeters [[Roy Eldridge]] and Dizzy Gillespie, the guitarist [[Herb Ellis]], and the pianists Tommy Flanagan, [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Lou Levy (pianist)|Lou Levy]], [[Paul Smith (pianist)|Paul Smith]], [[Jimmy Rowles]], and [[Ellis Larkins]] all worked with Fitzgerald mostly in live, small group settings.\n\nPossibly Fitzgerald's greatest unrealized collaboration (in terms of popular music) was a studio or live album with [[Frank Sinatra]]. The two appeared on the same stage only periodically over the years, in television specials in 1958 and 1959, and again on 1967's ''[[A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim]]'', a show that also featured [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]]. Pianist Paul Smith has said, \"Ella loved working with [Frank]. Sinatra gave her his dressing-room on ''A Man and His Music'' and couldn't do enough for her.\" When asked, Norman Granz would cite \"complex contractual reasons\" for the fact that the two artists never recorded together.<ref name=\"Nicholson\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/pschmid1/essays/sinatra/sinatra2.html|title=On Frank Sinatra's Hair|website=Swarthmore.edu|access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref> Fitzgerald's appearance with Sinatra and Count Basie in June 1974 for a series of concerts at [[Caesars Palace]], Las Vegas, was seen as an important incentive for Sinatra to return from his self-imposed retirement of the early 1970s.

The marriage was [[annulment|annulled]] in 1942.{{sfn |Nicholson |2004 |pp=67\u201368}} Her second marriage was in December 1947, to the famous [[double bass|bass]] player [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], whom she had met while on tour with [[Dizzy Gillespie]]'s band a year earlier. Together they adopted a child born to Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances, whom they christened [[Ray Brown Jr.]] With Fitzgerald and Brown often busy touring and recording, the child was largely raised by his mother's aunt, Virginia. Fitzgerald and Brown divorced in 1953, due to the various career pressures both were experiencing at the time, though they would continue to perform together.<ref name=\"nyobit\" />\n\nIn July 1957, [[Reuters]] reported that Fitzgerald had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a young Norwegian, in [[Oslo]].

[[Trumpet]] player [[Mario Bauz\u00e1]], who played behind Fitzgerald in her early years with [[Chick Webb]], remembered that \"she didn't hang out much.
