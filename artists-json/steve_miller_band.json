The group had a string of mid- to late-1970s hit singles that are staples of [[classic rock]], as well as several earlier [[psychedelic rock]] albums. Miller left his first band to move to San Francisco and form the Steve Miller Blues Band. Shortly after Harvey Kornspan negotiated the band's contract with [[Capitol Records]] in 1967, the band shortened its name to the Steve Miller Band. In February 1968, the band recorded its debut album, ''[[Children of the Future (Steve Miller Band album)|Children of the Future]]''. It went on to produce the albums ''[[Sailor (album)|Sailor]]'', ''[[Brave New World (Steve Miller Band album)|Brave New World]]'', ''[[Your Saving Grace]]'', ''[[Number 5 (Steve Miller Band album)|Number 5]]'', ''[[Rock Love]]'', ''[[Fly Like an Eagle (album)|Fly Like an Eagle]]'', ''[[Book of Dreams]]'', among others. The band's ''[[Greatest Hits 1974\u201378]]'', released in 1978, sold over 13 million copies. In 2016, Steve Miller was inducted as a solo artist in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Steve Miller Interlochen.jpg|thumb|Steve Miller performing at [[Interlochen Center for the Arts#Interlochen Arts Camp|Interlochen Fine Arts Camp]] on July 20, 2009]]\n\nIn 1965, after moving to Chicago to play the [[blues]], Steve Miller and keyboardist [[Barry Goldberg]] founded the Goldberg-Miller Blues Band along with bassist Roy Ruby, rhythm guitarist Craymore Stevens, and drummer Maurice McKinley. The band contracted to [[Epic Records]] and recorded a single, \"The Mother Song\", which they performed on ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'', before Miller left the group and moved to San Francisco.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uy6aKA1rTrEC&pg=PR48-IA23|page=xiviii|title=Crossroads: How the Blues Shaped Rock 'n' Roll|author=John Milward|publisher=UPNE|date= 2013|isbn=9781555537449}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/goldberg-miller-blues-band-1965-66-mw0000593963|work=allmusic.com|author=Lindsay Planer|title=Barry Goldberg / The Goldberg-Miller Blues Band Goldberg-Miller Blues Band 1965-66}}</ref>\n\nMiller then formed The Steve Miller Blues Band. Harvey Kornspan, managing partner, wrote and negotiated the band's contract ($860,000 over five years as well as $25,000 of promotion money that was to be spent at the band's discretion) with Capitol/[[EMI|EMI Records]] then-president [[Alan W. Livingston|Alan Livingston]] in 1967. Shortly after, the band's name was shortened to The Steve Miller Band at the recommendation of [[George Martin]] in order to broaden its appeal. The band, consisting of Miller, guitarist James Cooke, bassist Lonnie Turner, drummer [[Tim Davis (musician)|Tim Davis]] (who replaced the departing Lance Haas on drums) and Jim Peterman on Hammond B3 organ, backed [[Chuck Berry]] at a gig at the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] that was released as the live album, ''[[Live at the Fillmore Auditorium (Chuck Berry album)|Live at Fillmore Auditorium]]''.<ref name=\"chuckberry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckberry.us/wolfgangsvault.html |title=Chuck Berry News |publisher=Chuckberry.us |access-date=2014-08-23}}</ref> Guitarist [[Boz Scaggs]] joined the band soon after and the group performed at the [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival|Magic Mountain Festival]] (festival was held June 10/11, 1967) and the following week at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] (festival was held June 16/17/18, 1967).\n\nIn March 1968, while in England, the band recorded their debut album, ''[[Children of the Future (Steve Miller Band album)|Children of the Future]]'', at Olympic studios with [[Glyn Johns]] as engineer/producer. The album did not score among the Top 100 album chart. The visit itself got off to a poor start also as the group and their entourage were arrested for 'importing drugs and possession of a dangerous firearm'. Kornspan's wife had called Johns asking if he would appear as a character witness in the magistrate's court the day after the arrest and, hopefully, stand bail for them. Johns agreed and the group was released on condition that Johns would 'stand surety for their good behavior' for the rest of their time in England. Both accusations were dropped. The 'dangerous firearm' turned out to be a non-working flare gun that was being used as a wall decoration in the house where the group was staying. The 'imported drugs' happened to be some hash that was buried in the middle of a large fruitcake that had been sent to the group by a stateside friend, totally unbeknownst to anyone in the group.<ref name=Johns>{{cite book |last1=Johns |first1=Glyn |title=Sound Man |date=2015 |publisher=Plume |location=New York |isbn=978-0-14-751657-2 |pages=98-103 |edition=First}}</ref>   \n\nThe second album ''[[Sailor (album)|Sailor]]'' appeared in October 1968 and climbed the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart to {{thinspace|No.| 24}}. Successes included the single \"Living in the USA.\" ''[[Brave New World (Steve Miller Band album)|Brave New World]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 22}}, 1969) featured the songs \"Space Cowboy\" and \"My Dark Hour\".  [[Paul McCartney]], credited as \"Paul Ramon\", played drums, bass and sang backing vocals on \"My Dark Hour\". This was followed by ''[[Your Saving Grace]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 38}}, 1969) and ''[[Number 5 (Steve Miller Band album)|Number 5]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 23}}, 1970). In 1971, Miller broke his neck in a car accident. Capitol Records released the album ''[[Rock Love]]'', featuring unreleased live performances and studio material. This is one of two Steve Miller Band albums not to be released on CD, the other being ''[[Recall the Beginning...A Journey from Eden]]''. In 1972, the double album compilation ''[[Anthology (Steve Miller Band album)|Anthology]]'' was released, containing 16 songs from the band's first six of seven albums.\n\nThe style and personnel of the band changed radically with ''[[The Joker (album)|The Joker]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 1}}, 1973), concentrating on straightforward rock and leaving the psychedelic blues side of the band behind. The title track, \"[[The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)|The Joker]]\", became a {{thinspace|No.| 1}} single and was certified platinum, reaching over one million sales. It was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on January 11, 1974.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/332 332]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/332}}</ref>\n\nThree years later, the band returned with the album ''[[Fly Like an Eagle (album)|Fly Like an Eagle]]'', which charted at {{thinspace|No.| 3}}. Three singles were released from the album: \"[[Take the Money and Run (Steve Miller Band song)|Take the Money and Run]]\" ({{thinspace|No.| 11}}), \"[[Fly Like an Eagle (song)|Fly Like an Eagle]]\" ({{thinspace|No.| 2}}) and their second {{thinspace|No.| 1}} success, \"[[Rock'n Me]]\".
