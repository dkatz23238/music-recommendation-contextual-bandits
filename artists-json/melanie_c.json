The song \"Go\" makes an appearance in ''[[Whatever It Takes (2000 film)|Whatever It Takes]]''. \"Suddenly Monday\" appears in ''[[Maybe Baby (2000 film)|Maybe Baby]]'' and on its soundtrack. After the song gained popularity, \"I Turn to You\" was featured in the film ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]''. It was covered by [[Darkseed (band)|Darkseed]] on \"Ultimate Darkness\", by [[Machinae Supremacy]] on \"Webography\", and by [[Wig Wam]] on ''[[667.. The Neighbour of the Beast]]''. The song was also featured in the musical ''[[Viva Forever (musical)|Viva Forever!]]'', a musical show based on the songs of the [[Spice Girls]]. Some songs have also been covered by international artists such as [[FanFan|Christine Fan]], who covered and translated \"Suddenly Monday\" in Chinese for her debut album ''[[FanFan's World]]'', and Dutch pop singer [[Do (singer)|Do]] who covered the Japanese bonus-track \"Follow Me\", for her [[Follow Me (Do album)|album of the same name]]. The single \"First Day of My Life\" was originally recorded by Italian tenor [[Andrea Bocelli]], with lyrics in [[Italian language|Italian]] as \"Un Nuovo Giorno\" (''A new day'') for his 2004 album ''[[Andrea (Andrea Bocelli album)|Andrea]]'', and he also released it as a single the same year. Chisolm's version of the single was a success in German-speaking countries because it was used as the title song of the German soap opera telenovela ''[[Wege zum Gl\u00fcck]]''. At the time of ''The Sea''{{'}}s release, the lead single \"Rock Me\" served as the official [[theme song]] for [[Germany|German]] TV channel [[ZDF]]'s coverage of the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Album Announcement|url=http://www.melaniec.net/news/archive/436-album-announcement|work=MelanieC.net|publisher=Red Girl Records Ltd.|access-date=10 June 2011|date=7 June 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929203202/http://www.melaniec.net/news/archive/436-album-announcement|archive-date=29 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n{{Main|Melanie C discography}}\n{{See also|Spice Girls discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n* ''[[Northern Star (Melanie C album)|Northern Star]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Reason (Melanie C album)|Reason]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Beautiful Intentions]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[This Time (Melanie C album)|This Time]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[The Sea (Melanie C album)|The Sea]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Stages (Melanie C album)|Stages]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Version of Me]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Melanie C (album)|Melanie C]]'' (2020)\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Film\n!
