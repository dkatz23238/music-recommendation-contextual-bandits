The recordings started out as simple song based tracks with Tiersen playing acoustic guitar, [[mandolin]] and [[bouzouki]].  New layers were added to the recordings creating a more complex sound. Then an array of vintage synthesisers and electric guitars were added to create further textures.<ref name=\"MusicOMH-2010\">{{cite web |last=Randell |first=Edward |url=http://www.musicomh.com/features/interviews/interview-yann-tiersen |title=Interview: Yann Tiersen |work=Features |publisher=[[MusicOMH]] |year=2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"yt-dl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yanntiersen.com/dust-lane/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130210032605/http://www.yanntiersen.com/dust-lane/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2013 |title=Dust Lane |publisher=Yann Tiersen Official Website }}</ref> The album was released by [[Mute Records]] in Europe and [[ANTI-]] Records in the US.<ref name=\"anti-dl\">{{cite web |url=http://www.anti.com/releases/dust-lane/ |publisher=ANTI- |work=Catalog |title=Yann Tiersen, Dust Lane }}</ref><ref name=\"mute-dl\">{{cite web |url=http://mute.com/release/yann-tiersen-dust-lane |publisher=Mute Records |work=Releases |title=Yann Tiersen \u2022 Dust Lane }}</ref><ref name=\"am-dl\">{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1963214|label=''Dust Lane''}}</ref> The record was promoted in a tour beginning in October 2010, starting in New York City. ''Dust Lane'' was preceded by the release of the vinyl EP ''PALESTINE'' and by the single for \"Ashes\". In 2010, Tiersen also contributed to the tribute album to cross-genre, experimental music group [[Coil (band)|Coil]] ''The Dark Age of Love'' by This Immortal Coil, a one-off tribute formation, and to ''[[Li(f)e]]'', the fourth solo studio album by hip-hop artist [[Sage Francis]].\n\nOctober 2011 saw the European release of his seventh studio album, ''[[Skyline (Yann Tiersen album)|Skyline]]''. The nine-track album, a follow on from his ''Dust Lane'', was once again recorded at Tiersen's home on the island of Ushant in the south-western end of the [[English Channel]], with further parts recorded in Paris, San Francisco, Berlin, and [[Nashville]].

His musical style is deceptively easy to recognize but difficult to define. It varies greatly from one album to another and with time.  His melancholic music and composing techniques mix  classical and [[folk music]] elements with pop and rock ones. His delicate but deeply emotional style has been linked to [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and the other great masters of [[Romantic music]], and also to [[Erik Satie]], the colourful figure of the early 20th century Parisian [[avant-garde]] whose work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as [[minimalism]], [[repetitive music]], and the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/erik-satie-his-music-the-vision-his-legacy |title=Erik Satie: His music, the vision, his legacy |date=16 April 2010 |location=Barnard's Inn Hall |publisher=Gresham College |work=Lectures and Events |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102053914/http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/erik-satie-his-music-the-vision-his-legacy |archive-date=2 January 2013 }}</ref> Tiersen is also compared to one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century, the American [[minimalism]], classical\u2013[[Contemporary classical music|contemporary classical]], and [[ambient music]] composer [[Philip Glass]],<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/influentials/16903/ |title=The Most Influential People in Classical and Dance |date=8 May 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Guardian Profile: Philip Glass |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/nov/24/arts.highereducation1 |date=24 November 2001 |first=John |last=O'Mahony |journal=[[The Guardian]] |location=London}}</ref> and to British minimalist music composer, pianist, [[libretto|librettist]] and [[musicologist]] [[Michael Nyman]], known for the many film [[soundtrack|scores]] he wrote during his lengthy career and who is the reason for Tiersen to be often called the Gallic Michael Nyman.<ref name=\"am-yt-bio\" />\n\n{{Quote box\n |width   = 234px\n |align   = right\n |salign  = right\n |quote   = I couldn\u2019t play a brass instrument \u2014 I tried but I was really bad at it \u2014 I couldn\u2019t play the flute, but the piano accordion was a keyboard so it was easy for me.\n |source  = \u2014Yann Tiersen<ref name=\"MusicOMH-2010\" />\n}}\nTiersen started playing the piano and the violin at a young age.<ref name=\"e2\" /> In 1983, at the age of thirteen, he broke his violin and bought an electric guitar. Tiersen only returned to his beginnings instrument years later, after searching for string sounds to [[Sampling (music)|sample]].<ref name=\"MusicOMH-2010\" /> For his music albums, Tiersen composes and makes arrangements incorporating many instruments, including keyboards such as the piano, [[electric piano]], [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes]], organs, [[harpsichord]], [[Bontempi]] and toy pianos, [[Korg]] and [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] synthesizers, [[Mellotron]], piano accordions and [[melodica]], [[String instrument|string]]s as the violin, [[viola]], [[violone]] and the cello, different types of electric, acoustic or bass guitars, [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], [[ukulele]], [[bouzouki]] and [[oud]], [[brass instrument|brass]]es, like [[French horn|horn]]s, and woodwind instruments such as the saxophone, [[clarinet]], [[bassoon]], [[Pipe (instrument)|pipe]], [[oboe]] and the flute, percussions like drums, [[vibraphone]], [[marimba]], [[tubular bells]], [[Tom (instrument)|tom]], [[cymbal]], [[glockenspiel]] and [[Gong|tam-tam]], or the sounds produced by [[Leslie speaker]], [[music box]], [[carillon]]s, [[typewriter]]s, [[Cookware and bakeware|cooking vessel]]s, chairs, a [[Automobile|car]] or a [[bicycle wheel]]. Tiersen plays all of these instruments himself either in the studio or on a live set.<ref name=\"am-yt-bio\" />\n\n===Film scores===\nTiersen's ability to compose music that can be easily used for [[film score]]s was evident from the beginning. All tracks from his debut album, ''[[La Valse des monstres]]'', were conceived for stage adaptations and plays. The title track of his second album, ''[[Rue des cascades]]'', was used for ''[[The Dreamlife of Angels]]'' by [[Erick Zonca]],<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\" /><ref name=\"ac-1999\" /> and several tracks from both albums plus three songs from ''[[Le Phare]]'' are featured on the soundtrack to [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]]'s film ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]''.<ref name=\"ATP-YT\" /> Another track form ''Le Phare'', \"L'Homme aux bras ballants\", is the soundtrack to a short animation film by Laurent Gorgiard. Tiersen's pieces are also featured on ''[[Alice et Martin]]'' by [[Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9]], and ''Qui plume la lune?'' by Christine Carri\u00e8re.\n\nFollowing the box-office success of ''Am\u00e9lie'',<ref name=\"MusicOMH-2002\" /><ref name=\"am-yt-bio\" /> Tiersen's skills as a composer of film scores were much in demand, and this led him to compose the music for ''[[Good Bye, Lenin!]]'' by [[Wolfgang Becker (director, born 1954)|Wolfgang Becker]]. Although the soundtrack for ''Am\u00e9lie'' consisted mainly of pieces that Tiersen had previously released on his first two albums, the soundtrack for ''Good Bye, Lenin!'' was conceived from scratch, except for \"Comptine d'un autre \u00e9t\u00e9 : L'apr\u00e8s-midi\", which is also featured on ''Am\u00e9lie'''s soundtrack.<ref name=\"ATP-YT\" />\n\nTiersen returned to making film soundtracks in 2008 after a years-long break, creating the score for a documentary about the sailor [[\u00c9ric Tabarly]].<ref name=\"ATP-YT\" />\n\n===Collaborations===\nTiersen has always composed his music in solitude, starting from simple melodies to which he added subsequent layers. His first album, ''[[La Valse des monstres]]'', is almost entirely performed by him alone playing all the instruments, with the exception of \"Quimper 94\" and \"Le Banquet\" with drums and [[Hi-hat (instrument)|charleston]] provided by Laurent Heudes.<ref name=\"am-lvdm\" /> His second album, ''[[Rue des cascades]]'', saw the participation of French soloist singer [[Claire Pichet]], who provided vocals on two tracks on the album, \"Rue des cascades\" and \"Naomi\", and Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Schweyer, who played cello on \"C'\u00e9tait ici\" and \"La Fen\u00eatre\".<ref name=\"am-rdc\" /> ''[[Le Phare]]'' saw his first collaboration with French singer and songwriter [[Dominique A]]. Claire Pichet and drummer Sacha Toorop are also featured on this album,<ref name=\"am-lp\" /> but both albums can be considered as a one-man works.\n\nIt is at this point in his career, around the end of the nineties, that his collaborations begin to grow. In 1997, he collaborated with French rock band [[Noir D\u00e9sir]], the following year Tiersen and Dominique A released the single for \"Monochrome\",{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and, in collaboration with French [[electronic rock]] band B\u00e4stard, the EP ''B\u00e4stard ~ Yann Tiersen'',{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} while 1999 saw the releases of ''[[Tout est calme]]'', a collaboration mini album by Yann Tiersen, The Married Monk, Claire Pichet, and Olivier Mellano,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and of his first live album, ''[[Black Session: Yann Tiersen]]''. The live album, recorded in December 1998, features Tiersen with Claire Pichet, Dominique A, [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]]'s singer and songwriter [[Neil Hannon]], Noir D\u00e9sir's singer and songwriter [[Bertrand Cantat]], singer and illustrator [[Fran\u00e7oiz Breut]], anglophone French rock band The Married Monk, French folk rock group [[T\u00eates Raides]], the [[string quartet]] Quatuor \u00e0 cordes, guitarist and composer Olivier Mellano, and author [[Mathieu Boogaerts]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The soundtrack for ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' saw for the first time the introduction of a full orchestra, the 35-member Ensemble Orchestral Synaxis, and of an [[ondes Martenot]] played by [[Christine Ott]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Both will participate in the recording sessions for his next album, ''[[L'Absente]]'', which also includes American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist [[Lisa Germano]], Belgian actress and singer [[Natacha R\u00e9gnier]], Neil Hannon, and T\u00eates Raides, among others.<ref name=\"am-la\" />\n\nTiersen's list of collaborators continues to grow.
