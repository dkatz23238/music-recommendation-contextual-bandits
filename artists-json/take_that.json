Martin-Smith's vision, however, was a teen-orientated group that would appeal to more than one demographic segment of the music industry. Martin-Smith was then introduced to young singer-songwriter [[Gary Barlow]], who had been performing in clubs since the age of 15. Impressed with Barlow's catalogue of self-written material, Martin-Smith decided to build his new-look boy band around Barlow's musical abilities. A campaign to audition young men with abilities in dancing and singing followed and took place in Manchester and other surrounding cities in 1990. At 22, [[Howard Donald]] was one of the oldest to audition, but was chosen after he got time off work as a vehicle painter to continue the process. A budding [[Disc jockey|DJ]], he and Barlow had a shared interest in [[electronic music|electronic]] acts such as [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD) and [[Gary Numan]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Ross|title=Sixty Seconds: with Howard Donald|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=22 February 2019|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/music/interview-gary-barlow-on-fly-songs-inspired-by-eddie-the-eagle/|title=Gary Barlow didn't just meet his '80s heroes, he made a retro album with them|last=Mettler|first=Mike|date=17 June 2016|website=[[Digital Trends]]|access-date=4 October 2022}}</ref> Prior to auditioning, [[Jason Orange]] had appeared as a breakdancer on the popular television programme ''[[The Hit Man and Her]]''. Martin-Smith also selected 18-year-old bank employee [[Mark Owen]] and finally 16-year-old [[Robbie Williams]] to round out the group, which initially went by the name Kick It.\n\n===1990\u20131992: ''Take That & Party''===\nTake That's first TV appearance was on ''The Hit Man and Her'' in 1990, where they performed Barlow's self-written, unreleased song, \"My Kind of Girl\". They later appeared a second time to perform \"Waiting Around\", which would become the B-side for the first single, \"[[Do What U Like]]\". \"[[Promises (Take That song)|Promises]]\" and \"[[Once You've Tasted Love]]\" were also released as singles but were minor hits in the UK. Take That initially worked the same territory as their American counterparts, singing [[New jack swing|new jack R&B]], urban soul, and mainstream pop. However, they worked their way toward [[Hi-NRG]] dance music, while also pursuing an adult contemporary ballad direction. As they aimed to break into the mainstream music industry, they worked a number of small clubs, schools, and events across the country building up a fanbase as they travelled to gigs constantly for months.\n\nTake That's breakthrough single was a cover of the 1975 [[Tavares (band)|Tavares]] hit \"[[It Only Takes a Minute]]\", which peaked at number seven on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in June 1992. This success was followed by \"[[I Found Heaven]]\", then by the first Barlow ballad \"[[A Million Love Songs]]\", which also reached number seven in October. Their cover of the [[Barry Manilow]] hit \"[[Could It Be Magic]]\" gave them their first big success, peaking at number three in the UK in the first chart of 1993. Their first album, ''[[Take That & Party]]'', was released in 1992, and included all the hit singles to date.\n\n===1993\u20131995: ''Everything Changes'', ''Nobody Else'' and superstardom===\n1993 saw the release of ''[[Everything Changes (Take That album)|Everything Changes]]'', based on Barlow's original material. It peaked at number one in the UK and spawned six singles, with four being consecutive UK number one singles \u2013 their first number one \"[[Pray (Take That song)|Pray]]\", \"[[Relight My Fire]]\", \"[[Babe (Take That song)|Babe]]\" and the title track \"[[Everything Changes (Take That song)|Everything Changes]]\". The lead single \"[[Why Can't I Wake Up with You]]\" had narrowly missed the top spot in the UK peaking at number two and the sixth and final single \"[[Love Ain't Here Anymore]]\" taken from the album reached number three on the UK charts. ''Everything Changes'' saw the band gain international success with the album being nominated for the 1994 [[Mercury Prize]], but it failed to crack the U.S. market, where an exclusive remix of \"Love Ain't Here Anymore\" (U.S. version) gained little success.\n\nBy 1994, Take That had become radio and television stars across Europe and Asia, but it was not until 1995 that they did their first World Tour. It was during the years 1993\u201395 that the band fronted scores of magazine covers ranging from ''[[Smash Hits]]'' to ''[[GQ]]'', becoming mass merchandised on all sorts of paraphernalia ranging from picture books, to posters, stickers, their own [[doll]]s, jewellery, caps, T-shirts, toothbrushes and even had their own annuals released.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/04/25/bmtakethat25.xml|title=Why I still love Take That \u2013 Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk | location=London | first=Bryony | last=Gordon | author-link=Bryony Gordon | date=25 April 2006 | access-date=24 May 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The band had also developed a large female teenage fanbase at the time. During this time, they performed at numerous music awards shows and chart shows such as the [[BRIT Awards]] and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', also winning the Best Live Act award in 1995 at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], having been renowned for their [[breakdance]] routines, high energy and creative tour productions.\n\nIn 1995, Take That released their third studio album ''[[Nobody Else]]'', again based on Barlow's own material which reached number 1 in the UK and across Europe, capturing new audiences along the way, with Take That also able to make inroads in the adult audience in Britain through Barlow's melodic, sensitive ballads. For nearly five years, Take That's popularity was unsurpassed in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/take-that/id13653352|title=Take That \u2013 Download Take That Music on iTunes|publisher=[[iTunes]]|access-date=18 July 2011}}</ref> The release of the first single from the album, \"[[Sure (Take That song)|Sure]]\", achieved yet another number one in the UK charts.

The album was also noted for its cover, which was a parody of the famed cover of The Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' cover sleeve.\n\n===1995\u20131996: Break-up and ''Greatest Hits''===\n[[File:Robbie paparazzi V sign.jpg|thumb|Robbie Williams left the band in 1995]]\nRobbie Williams's drug abuse had escalated to a near drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] in 1994.\n\nIn June 1995, Williams was photographed by the press partying with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] at the [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The following month, the band offered him an ultimatum; he was to adhere to the band's responsibilities or leave before their scheduled world tour. Williams chose the latter. Williams claimed he was bored with Barlow's leadership and jealous of Barlow. Despite the loss of Williams, Take That continued to promote ''Nobody Else'' as a four-piece, scoring a further hit single with \"[[Never Forget (Take That song)|Never Forget]]\" with Donald on lead vocals. They subsequently went to America and completed the Nobody Else Tour in October 1995. Following the tour, the band began to plan for their next album; however, when they spent Christmas together, they mutually agreed it was time to part ways.\n\nOn 13 February 1996, Take That formally announced that they were disbanding. This was followed by the ''[[Greatest Hits (Take That album)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation in 1996, which contained a new recording, a cover of the [[Bee Gees]]' \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\". The single went on to become what was to be the band's final UK number one until their 2006 comeback a decade later. Take That gave what was thought to be their final performance in April 1996 at Amsterdam.<ref name=\"everyHit.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/ |title=UK Top 40 Chart Archive, British Singles & Album Charts |publisher=everyHit.com |date=16 March 2000 |access-date=13 August 2010}}</ref> Following the band's announcement, millions of their fans were distraught around the world and in the UK alone, teenage girls threatened suicide and were seen lining streets in tears, to the point that telephone hotlines were set up by the government to deal with counselling them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/take-that-metro-radio-arena-newcastle-475430.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709173420/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/take-that-metro-radio-arena-newcastle-475430.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 July 2011 |title=Take That, Metro Radio Arena, Newcastle \u2013 Reviews, Music |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 April 2006 |access-date=18 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref> After the band broke up, highly respected music figures such as [[Elton John]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/elton-john-urges-full-take-that-reunion_1004334 |title=Elton John &#124; Elton John Urges Full Take That Reunion |magazine=Contactmusic |date=3 August 2006 |access-date=18 July 2011}}</ref> noted that Take That were different from other boy bands before and after them, in that they wrote their own material through Gary Barlow.

On 25 November 2005, there was an official press conference by the band announcing that the post-Robbie Williams line-up was going to tour in 2006. The tour, entitled ''[[The Ultimate Tour (Take That)|The Ultimate Tour]]'', ran from April to June 2006.

In 2015, the song \"Get Ready for It\" from their album ''[[III (Take That album)|III]]'', was chosen as the theme song for the film ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]''.\n\nIn 2017, Take That launched ''[[Greatest Days (musical)|The Band]]'', a musical written by [[Tim Firth]] featuring the five winners of ''Let It Shine'' and some of Take That's biggest hits.
