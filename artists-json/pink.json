The pigment commonly used for this was called light cinabrese; it was a mixture of the red earth pigment called [[sinopia]], or [[Venetian red]], and a white pigment called ''Bianco San Genovese'', or lime white. In his famous 15th century manual on painting, ''Il Libro Dell'Arte'', [[Cennino Cennini]] described it this way: \"This pigment is made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John\u2019s white, as it is called in Florence; and this white is made from thoroughly white and thoroughly purified lime. And when these two pigments have been thoroughly mulled together (that is, two parts cinabrese and the third white), make little loaves of them like half walnuts and leave them to dry.

When beef is cooked, the myoglobin proteins undergo oxidation, and gradually turn from red to pink to brown; that is, from rare to medium to well-done. Pork contains less myoglobin than beef and therefore is less red; when heated, it changes from pinkish-red to less pink to tan or white.\n\n[[Ham]], though it contains myoglobins like beef, undergoes a different transformation. Traditional hams, such as [[prosciutto]], are made by taking the hind leg or thigh of a pig, covering it with sea salt, which removes the moisture content, and then letting it dry or cure for as long as two years. The salt ([[sodium nitrate]]) permits the ham to retain its original pink color, even when dried out. Supermarket hams are made by a different and faster process; they are brined, or infused with a salt-water solution, containing [[sodium nitrite]], which transfers [[nitric oxide]], which bonds with the myoglobin to form the traditional pink cured ham color.\n\nThe shells and flesh of [[crustacean]]s such as [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s and [[shrimp]] contain a pink [[carotenoid]] pigment called [[astaxanthin]]. Their shells, naturally blue-green, turn pink or red when cooked. The flesh of the [[salmon]] also contains astaxanthin, which makes it pink. Farm-bred salmon are sometimes fed these pigments to improve their pinkness, and it is sometimes also used to enhance the color of [[egg yolk]]s. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Rostas (ready and served).JPG|[[Roast beef]] gets its distinctive pink color from [[myoglobin]], which gradually turns from red to pink to brown (rare to medium to well-done) when heated.\nFile:Prosciutto.jpg|Prosciutto hams also get their pink color from salt combined with the natural protein called [[myoglobin]].\nFile:Shelled northern shrimp.jpg|The shells and flesh of steamed [[shrimp]] contain a natural [[carotenoid]] pigment called [[astaxanthin]], which turns pink when heated.

The color comes from natural pigments called [[anthocyanins]], which also provide the pink in [[raspberries]].\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nPink_Rose_In_The_Rain_(216504571).jpg|A pink [[rose]] in the rain.\nClematite_chantily_01.JPG|A [[clematis]] Chantilly.\nFlickr_-_brewbooks_-_Pink_Hibiscus_-_Brisbane_(1).jpg|A pink [[hibiscus]] from Australia.\nTulip cv. 26.JPG|Pink [[tulips]] in the botanical gardens of [[Moscow State University]].\nDahlia_-_%22Gilt_Edge%22_cultivar.jpg|A pink [[dahlia]]\nGemeine_Pfingstrose.JPG|A pink [[peony]].\nMagnolia 'Susan' 03.JPG|A flower of a [[magnolia]] tree\nRhododendron_catawbiense_01.JPG|A pink [[rhododendron]]\nSpiraea_japonica_Alpina3.jpg|''[[Spiraea japonica]]'' flowers.\nCerisier_du_Japon_Prunus_serrulata.jpg|A Japanese cherry tree (''[[Prunus serrulata]]'') in bloom.\nHyazinthen.JPG|Pink [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]] flowers\nPhlox paniculata.jpg|''[[Phlox paniculata]]''\n</gallery>\n\n=== Pigments - Pinke ===\n{{Main|Pinke (color)}}\nIn the 17th century, the word ''pink'' or ''pinke'' was also used to describe a yellowish pigment, which was mixed with blue colors to yield greenish colors. [[Thomas Jenner (publisher)|Thomas Jenner]]'s ''A Book of Drawing, Limning, Washing'' (1652) categorises \"Pink & [[Blue|blew]] [[bice]]\" amongst the [[green]]s (p. &nbsp;38),<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenner|first=Thomas |title=A Book of Drawing, Limning, Washing|publisher=M. Simmons |location=London |year=1652 |page=38 |url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp20532}}</ref> and specifies several admixtures of greenish colors made with pink\u2014e.g. \"Grasse-green is made of Pink and Bice, it is shadowed with [[Indigo]] and Pink \u2026 French-green of Pink and Indico [shadowed with] Indico\" (pp.&nbsp;38\u201340). In [[William Salmon]]'s ''Polygraphice'' (1673), \"Pink yellow\" is mentioned amongst the chief [[yellow]] pigments (p.&nbsp;96), and the reader is instructed to mix it with either [[Saffron (color)|Saffron]] or [[Venetian ceruse|Ceruse]] for \"sad\" or \"light\" shades thereof, respectively.\n\n=== Sonics ===\n* [[Pink noise]] ({{Audio|Pink noise.ogg|sample}}), also known as 1/f noise, in [[audio engineering]] is a signal or process with a frequency spectrum such that the power spectral density is proportional to the reciprocal of the frequency.\n\n=== Lighting ===\n*[[Grow light]]s often use a combination of red and blue wavelengths, which generally appear pink to the human eye.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://inhabitat.com/indoor-vertical-farm-pinkhouses-grow-plants-faster-with-less-energy/ | title=Indoor Vertical Farm 'Pinkhouses' Grow Plants Faster With Less Energy | work=Inhabitat | date=23 May 2013 | access-date=November 16, 2015}}</ref>\n*Pink [[neon sign]]s are generally produced using one of two different methods. One method is to use neon gas and a blue or purple phosphor, which generally produces a warmer (more reddish) or more intense shade of pink. Another method is to use an argon/mercury blend and a red phosphor, which generally produces a cooler (more purplish) or softer shade of pink.\n*Pink [[LED]]s can be produced using two methods, either with a blue LED using two phosphors (yellow for the first phosphor, and red, orange, or pink for the second), or by placing a pink dye on top of a white LED. Color shifting was a common issue with early pink LEDs, where the red, orange, or pink phosphors or dyes faded over time, causing the pink color to eventually shift towards white or blue. These issues have been mitigated by the more recent introduction of more fade-resistant phosphors.\n\n=== Engineering ===\n*Insulation manufactured by [[Owens Corning]] is dyed pink, with the [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] as its corporate mascot. The company holds a trademark on the color pink for insulation products in order to prevent competitors from using it, and is the first company in the United States to trademark a color.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-marketing/color-branding-legal-rights | title=Color Branding & Trademark Rights | work=Color Matters | access-date=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n*The United States [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] specifies fluorescent pink as an optional color for [[traffic sign]]s used for [[incident management]] as an alternative to the traditional orange in order to distinguish them from construction zone signs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part6/part6f.htm | title=MUTCD 2009 Edition Chapter 6F.

Pink was the favorite color of only two percent of respondents.<ref>Eva Heller, Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques, p. 179.</ref> There was a notable difference between men and women in regards to a preference for pink; three percent of women chose pink as their favorite color, compared with less than one percent of men. Many of the men surveyed were unable to even identify pink correctly, confusing it with [[mauve]]. Pink was also more popular with older people than younger.<ref>Eva Heller, Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques, p. 179</ref>\n\nIn Japan, pink is the color most commonly associated with [[spring (season)|springtime]] due to the blooming cherry blossoms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://threads.srithreads.com/2011/04/spring-is-pink/ | title=Spring is Pink | work=SRI Threads | date=April 4, 2011 | access-date=January 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.calvin-c.com/blog/season-colour/ | title=Season Colour \u2013 I Think Spring is Green | work=Calvin-C.com | access-date=February 17, 2016 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306214652/http://www.calvin-c.com/blog/season-colour/ | archive-date=March 6, 2016 }}</ref> This is different from surveys in the United States and Europe where [[green]] is the color most associated with springtime.\n\n===Pink in other languages===\nIn many languages, the word for the color pink is based on the name of the [[rose]] flower; like ''rose'' in French; ''roze'' in Dutch; ''rosa'' in German, Latin, Portuguese, Catalan, Spanish, Italian, Swedish and Norwegian ([[Nynorsk]] and [[Bokm\u00e5l]]); ''rozovyy/\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439'' in Russian; ''r\u00f3\u017cowy'' in Polish; \u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3 (''var\u00f3d'') in Hebrew; \u0997\u09cb\u09b2\u09be\u09aa\u09bf (''golapi'') in Bangla; and \u0917\u0941\u0932\u093e\u092c\u0940 (''gul\u0101bee'') in Hindi. In English \"rose\", too, often refers to both the flower and the color.\n\nIn Danish, Faroese and Finnish, the color pink is described as a lighter shade of red: ''lyser\u00f8d'' in Danish, ''lj\u00f3sarey\u00f0ur'' in Faroese and ''vaaleanpunainen'' in Finnish, all meaning \"light red\". Similarly, some Celtic languages use a term meaning \"whitish red\": ''gwynnrudh'' in Cornish, ''b\u00e1ndearg'' in Irish, ''bane-yiarg'' in Manx, ''b\u00e0n-dhearg'' in Scottish Gaelic (which also uses ''liath-dhearg'' \"greyish/pale red\" and ''pinc'' from English). In Icelandic, the color is called ''bleikur'', originally meaning \"pale\".\n\nIn the Japanese language, the traditional word for pink, {{nihongo|'''''momo-iro'''''|\u3082\u3082\u3044\u308d}}, takes its name from the peach blossom. There is a separate word for the color of the cherry blossom: ''sakura-iro''. In recent times a word based on the English version, {{nihongo|'''''pinku'''''|\u30d4\u30f3\u30af}}, has begun to be used.\n\nIn Chinese, the color pink is named with a compound noun \u7c89\u7d05\u8272, meaning \"powder red\" where the powder refers to substances used for women's make-up.\n\nThe Thai word for the color, \u0e0a\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e39 (''chom-puu''), derives ultimately from Sanskrit \u091c\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0942 (''jamb\u016b'') \"[[Syzygium|rose apple]]\".\n\n===Idioms and expressions===\n* '''In the pink'''. To be in top form, in good health, in good condition. In Romeo and Juliet, Mercutio says; \"I am the very pink of courtesy.\" Romeo: Pink for flower? Mercutio: Right. Romeo: Then my pump is well flowered.\"<ref>Romeo and Juliet, Act 2, Scene 4</ref>\n* '''To see pink elephants''' means to hallucinate from alcoholism. The expression was used by American novelist [[Jack London]] in his book ''[[John Barleycorn (novel)|John Barleycorn]]'' in 1913.\n* '''[[Pink slip (employment)|Pink slip]]'''. To be given a pink slip means to be fired or dismissed from a job. It was first recorded in 1915 in the United States.\n* The phrase \"[[pink-collar worker]]\" refers to persons working in jobs conventionally regarded as \"[[women's work]]\".\n* [[Pink money]], ''the pink pound'' or ''pink dollar'' is an economic term which refers to the spending power of the [[LGBT]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securian.com/pdf/Opportunities2005.pdf |title=Opportunities in the Pink Economy of the United Kingdom |access-date=2010-09-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327012858/http://www.securian.com/pdf/Opportunities2005.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2009 }}</ref> [[Advertising]] agencies sometimes call the gay market the ''pink economy''.\n* '''Tickled pink''' means extremely pleased.\n\n===Architecture===\nEarly pink buildings were usually built of brick or [[sandstone]], which takes its pale red color from hematite, or iron ore. In the 18th century - the golden age of pink and other pastel colors - pink mansions and churches were built all across Europe. More modern pink buildings usually use the color pink to appear exotic or to attract attention.\n<gallery heights=\"150\">\nFile:2018-10-19 Buenos Aires by Sandro Halank\u2013002.jpg|[[Casa Rosada]], or the \"Pink House\", in [[Buenos Aires]], built between 1713 and 1855 as a fort and then customs house, is the official residence and office of the President of Argentina.\nFile:V\u00e4\u00e4ksy - Vesij\u00e4rventie 1.jpg|A pink building in [[V\u00e4\u00e4ksy]], [[Asikkala]], Finland.\nFile:Kannur City Centre, Kerala, India.jpg|The City Center in [[Kannur]], India.\nFile:Ostankino Palace (4325331247).jpg|[[Ostankino Palace]], outside of Moscow, is an 18th-century country house built by [[Pyotr Sheremetev]], then the richest man in Russia.\nFile:Macau Government Headquarters 01.JPG|[[Macau Government Headquarters]] (1849), an example of Portuguese colonial architecture and the [[Pombaline style]] in [[Macau]].\nFile:Royal Hawaiian Hotel seen from the sea.jpg|The [[Royal Hawaiian Hotel]] in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, built in 1927, was the first hotel on [[Waikiki Beach]].

Pink is also one of the few colors to be strongly associated with a particular aroma, that of roses.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques''</ref> Many [[strawberry]] and [[raspberry]]-flavored foods are colored pink and light red as well, sometimes to distinguish them from [[cherry]]-flavored foods that are more commonly colored dark red (although raspberry-flavored foods, particularly in the United States, are often colored blue as well). The drink [[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] was packaged in pink cans, presumably to subconsciously convey a sweet taste.\n\nThe pink color in most packaged and processed foods, ice creams, candies and pastries is made with artificial [[food coloring]]. The most common pink food coloring is [[erythrosine]], also known as Red No. 3, an [[organoiodine compound]], a derivative of [[fluorone]], which is a cherry-pink synthetic.<ref name=Ullmann>Phyllis A. Lyday \"Iodine and Iodine Compounds\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim</ref> It is usually listed on package labels as E-127. Another common red or pink (particularly in the United States where erythrosine is less frequently used) is [[Allura Red AC]] (E-129), also known as Red No. 40.

This is a relatively recent trend, with toys from the 1920s to the 1960s not being gendered by color (though they were gendered by a focus on domesticity and nurturing). The current color-based gendering of toys can be traced back to the deregulation of children's television programs.
