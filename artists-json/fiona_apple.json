She has released five albums from 1996 to 2020, which have all reached the top 20 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/fiona-apple/chart-history/tlp/|title = Fiona Apple|magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> Apple has received numerous [[List of awards and nominations received by Fiona Apple|awards and nominations]], including three [[Grammy Awards]], two [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and a [[Billboard Music Award]].\n\nThe youngest daughter of the actor [[Brandon Maggart]], Apple was born in New York City and was raised alternating between her mother's home in New York and her father's in Los Angeles. [[Classically trained]] on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when she was 15 (Never Is a Promise) and 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified Platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified [[Gold album|Gold]], and nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2013. Apple's fifth studio album, ''[[Fetch the Bolt Cutters]]'', was released in 2020 to universal acclaim, earning two Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Music Album and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance|Best Rock Performance]] for the lead single \"Shameika\".\n\n== Early life==\nFiona Apple was born Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart on September 13, 1977, in New York City to singer Diane McAfee and actor [[Brandon Maggart]], who met when both were cast in the Broadway musical ''[[Applause (musical)|Applause]]''.<ref name=lee>{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Dan P.|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209001851/http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/hiding-out-with-fiona-apple-musical-hermit.html|archive-date=February 9, 2013|url-status=live|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/hiding-out-with-fiona-apple-musical-hermit.html|title='I Just Want to Feel Everything': Hiding Out With Fiona Apple, Musical Hermit|date=June 17, 2012|work=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]|access-date=June 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/arts/a-message-far-less-pretty-than-the-face.html | title=A Message Far Less Pretty Than the Face | last=Ehrlich | first=Dimitri | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 5, 1997 |access-date=April 19, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref> Her father is from [[Tennessee]], and through him, Apple has [[Melungeon]] ancestry.<ref name=wtf /> Her maternal grandparents were dancer Millicent Green and [[big band]] vocalist Johnny McAfee.
