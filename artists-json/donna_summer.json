The trio forged a working partnership, and Donna was signed to their Oasis label in 1974. A demo tape of Summer's work with Moroder and Bellotte led to a deal with the European-distributed label Groovy Records. Due to an error on the record cover, Donna Sommer became Donna Summer; the name stuck. Summer's first album was ''[[Lady of the Night (album)|Lady of the Night]]''. It became a hit in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Belgium on the strength of two songs, \"[[The Hostage (song)|The Hostage]]\" and the title track \"Lady of the Night\". \"The Hostage\" reached the top of the charts in France, but was removed from radio playlists in Germany because of the song's subject matter; a high ranking politician that had recently been kidnapped and held for ransom.<ref name=\"CLbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/summer.html |title=Donna Summer |publisher=Classicbands.com |access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref> One of her first TV appearances was in the television show, ''[[Van Oekel's Discohoek]]'', which started the breakthrough of \"The Hostage\", and in which she gracefully went along with the scripted absurdity and chaos in the show.\n\nIn 1975, Summer passed on an idea for a song to Moroder who was working with another artist; a song that would be called [[Love to Love You Baby (song)|\"Love To Love You Baby\"]]. Summer and [[Giorgio Moroder|Moroder]] wrote the song together, and together they worked on a demo version with Summer singing the song. [[Giorgio Moroder|Moroder]] decided that Summer's version should be released. Seeking an American release for the song, it was sent to [[Casablanca Records]] president [[Neil Bogart]]. Bogart played the song at one of his extravagant industry parties, where it was so popular with the crowd, they insisted that it be played over and over, each time it ended. Bogart requested that Moroder produce a longer version for discoth\u00e8ques. Moroder, [[Pete Bellotte|Bellotte]], and Summer returned with a 17-minute version. Bogart tweaked the title to \"Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby\", and Casablanca signed Summer, releasing the single in November 1975. The shorter 7\" version of the single was promoted by radio stations, while clubs regularly played the 17-minute version (the longer version would also appear on the album).\n\nBy early 1976, \"Love to Love You Baby\" had reached No. 2 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and had become a Gold single, while the album had sold over a million copies. The song generated controversy due to Summer's moans and groans, and some American stations, like those in Europe with the initial release, refused to play it.<ref name=\"telegraph2\"/> Despite this, \"Love to Love You Baby\" found chart success in several European countries, and made the Top 5 in the United Kingdom despite the BBC ban. Casablanca Records wasted no time releasing the follow-up album ''[[A Love Trilogy]]'', featuring \"[[Try Me, I Know We Can Make It]]\u201d.\n[[File:Donna Summer 1977.JPG|thumb|Summer in a recording studio in September 1977]]\nIn 1977, Summer released the concept album ''[[I Remember Yesterday]]''. The song \"[[I Feel Love]]\", reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 chart. and No. 1 in the UK. She received her first [[American Music Award]] nomination for Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist. The single would attain Gold status and the album went Platinum in the US. Another concept album, also released in 1977, was ''[[Once Upon a Time (Donna Summer album)|Once Upon a Time]]'', a double album which told of a modern-day [[Cinderella]] \"rags to riches\" story. This album would attain Gold status. Summer recorded the song \"[[Down Deep Inside]]\" as the theme song for the 1977 film ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]''. In 1978, Summer acted in the film ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]'', the film met with modest success; the song \"[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]\", reached No. 3 on the Hot 100. The soundtrack and single both went Gold and resulted in Summer winning her first [[Grammy Award]], for [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]. Its writer, [[Paul Jabara]], won both an [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for the composition. Summer also had \"[[With Your Love]]\" and \"[[Je t'aime... moi non plus#Covers|Je t'aime... moi non plus]]\", on the soundtrack. Her version of the [[Jimmy Webb]] ballad, \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\", became her first No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 chart. It was also the only No. 1 hit for songwriter Jimmy Webb; the single went Gold and topped the charts for three weeks. She received a Grammy nomination for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. The song was featured on Summer's first live album, ''[[Live and More]]'', which also became her first album to hit number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and went double-Platinum, selling over 2 million copies.

In July 1979, Summer topped the Hot 100 singles chart, and the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart, and the Soul singles chart simultaneously. In the week of November 10, 1979, \"Dim All the Lights\" peaked at No. 2 for two weeks; the following week \"[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]\" would get to No. 3; and once again Summer would have two songs in the top 3, on the Hot 100. One week later, \"No More Tears\" climbed to No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 chart, and \"Dim All the Lights\" went to No. 4; she again had two songs in the top 5 of the Hot 100 chart. In the span of eight months, Summer had topped both the singles and albums charts simultaneously, three times. She became the first Female Artist to have three number-one singles in a calendar year.

After the release of the ''[[On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II|On the Radio]]'' album, Summer wanted to branch out into other musical styles, which led to tensions between her and [[Casablanca Records]]. Casablanca wanted her to continue to record disco only. Summer was upset with President [[Neil Bogart]] over the early release of the single \"[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]\", because Casablanca didn't wait until her previous single, \"[[Dim All the Lights]]\", had peaked; she had penned \"Dim All the Lights\" alone, and was hoping for a number-one hit as a songwriter. Summer and the label parted ways in 1980, and she signed with [[Geffen Records]], the new label started by [[David Geffen]].

Both, \"I'm a Rainbow\" and \"[[Don't Cry for Me Argentina]]\" would be on her 1993 anthology album.\n\nDavid Geffen hired top R&B and pop producer [[Quincy Jones]] to produce Summer's next album, the eponymously titled ''[[Donna Summer (album)|Donna Summer]]''. The album took over six months to record as Summer, who was pregnant at the time, found it hard to sing.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}} During the recording of the project, [[Neil Bogart]] died of cancer in May 1982 at age 39. Summer would sing at his funeral. The album included the top-ten hit \"[[Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)]]\"; for which she received a Grammy nomination for [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]. Summer was also nominated for [[Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for \"[[Protection (Donna Summer song)|Protection]]\", penned for her by [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Other singles included a cover of the [[Jon and Vangelis]] song \"[[State of Independence]]\" ({{abbr|No.|Number}} 41 pop) and \"[[The Woman in Me (Donna Summer song)|The Woman in Me]]\" (No. 33 pop).\n\nBy then [[Geffen Records]] had been notified by [[Polygram Records]], which now owned Casablanca, that Summer still needed to deliver to them one more album to fulfill her contract. Summer had her biggest success in the 1980s while on Geffen's roster with her next album ''[[She Works Hard for the Money (album)|She Works Hard for the Money]]'' and its [[She Works Hard for the Money|title song]]\u2014which were released by [[Mercury Records]] in a one-off arrangement to settle Summer's split with the soon-to-be-defunct Casablanca Records, whose catalogue now resided with Mercury and Casablanca's parent company [[PolyGram]].\n\nSummer recorded and delivered the album ''[[She Works Hard for the Money (album)|She Works Hard for the Money]]'' and Polygram released it on its [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] imprint in 1983. The title song became a major hit, reaching {{abbr|No.|Number}} 3 on the US Hot 100, as well as No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s R&B chart for three weeks. It also garnered Summer another Grammy nomination, for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. \"[[Unconditional Love (Donna Summer song)|Unconditional Love]]\", which featured the British group [[Musical Youth]], and \"[[Love Has a Mind of Its Own]]\" did not crack the top 40. The album itself was certified Gold, and climbed to {{abbr|No.|Number}} 9 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart; the highest chart position of any female artist in male-dominated 1983. The song \"[[He's a Rebel (Donna Summer song)|He's a Rebel]]\" would win Summer her third Grammy Award, this time for [[Best Inspirational Performance]].\n\nBritish director [[Brian Grant (director)|Brian Grant]] was hired to direct Summer's video for \"[[She Works Hard for the Money]]\". The video was a success, being nominated for Best Female Video and Best Choreography at the [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards|1984 MTV Music Video Awards]]; Summer became one of the first African-American artists, and the first African-American female artist to have her video played in ''heavy rotation'' on [[MTV]]. Grant would also be hired to direct Summer's Costa Mesa [[HBO]] concert special, ''A Hot Summers Night''. Grant, who was a fan of the song \"[[State of Independence]]\", had an idea for a grand finale. He wanted a large chorus of children to join Summer on stage at the ending of the song. His team looked for local school children in Orange County, to create a chorus of 500 students. On the final day of rehearsals, the kids turned up and they had a full rehearsal. According to Grant, \"It looked and sounded amazing. It was a very emotional, very tearful experience for everyone who was there.\" He thought if this was that kind of reaction in rehearsal, then what an impact it would have in the concert. After the rehearsal Grant was informed that he could not use the kids because the concert would end after 10 pm; children could not be licensed to be on stage at such a late hour (California had strict child labor laws in 1983). \"It's a moment that I regret immensely: a grand finale concept I came up with that couldn't be filmed in the end\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Brian Grant/Directing A Diva (Donna Summer)|first=David|last=St. Mark|work=Daeida Magazine|date=February 2013|pages=12\u201316}}</ref> When the final sequence was filmed, Summer's daughter Mimi and her family members joined her on stage for \"State of Independence\".\n\nIn late 1983, David Geffen enlisted \"She Works Hard for the Money's\" producer [[Michael Omartian]] to produce ''[[Cats Without Claws]]''. Summer was happy that Geffen and his executives stayed out of the studio during the recording and thanked him in the album's liner notes, but her request for the lead single would be rejected. The album failed to attain Gold status in the US, her first album not to do so.<ref name=\"robio\">{{cite web |url=http://rogallery.com/Summer_Donna/Summer-biography.html |title=Donna Summer Biography |work=Rogallery |access-date=June 13, 2014}}</ref> It was first album not to yield a top-ten hit, since 1977's ''[[Once Upon a Time (Donna Summer album)|Once Upon a Time]]''.

He decided to reach out to Summer and, although she was not interested in singing the song, she was very much interested in working with Faltermeyer again. After a meeting with [[David Geffen]] he was on board with the project. Summer's main objective for the album was that it have stronger R&B influences; Faltermeyer who had just finished doing the soundtracks to ''[[Top Gun]]'' and ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'', was after a tough FM-oriented sound. On completion, Geffen liked what he heard, but his executives did not think there were enough songs that could be deemed singles. They wanted Faltermeyer to produce \"[[Dinner with Gershwin]]\", but he was already busy with another project, so another producer was found. They also substituted a previous recording called \"[[All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)|Bad Reputation]]\", songs like \"[[All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)|Fascination]]\", fell by the wayside. Geffen had shared the vision of moving Summer into the R&B market as a veteran artist, but these expectations were not met. Faltermeyer, in a 2012 interview with ''Daeida Magazine'', said, \"She was an older artist by then and the label's priority may have been on the youth market. The decision was made afterward by executives who were looking for a radio hit for 1987 and not something that would perhaps last beyond then.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Harold Faltermeyer Flood of memory: The Summer reign on Sunset Blvd|first=David|last=St. Mark|work=Daeida.com|date=October 2012|pages=13\u201328}}</ref> The label's President Ed Rosenblatt would later admit: \"The company never intended to focus on established superstars\".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 16, 1989|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-16/entertainment/ca-2322_1_ed-rosenblatt-geffen-records-atlantic-records|title=Donna Summer: New Label, New Hit?|first=Paul|last=Grein|access-date=June 13, 2014}}</ref> The album ''[[All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)|All Systems Go]]'', did not achieve Gold status.

The SAW team describe the working experience as a labour of love, and said it was their favourite album of all that they had recorded. Geffen decided not to release the album ''[[Another Place and Time]]'', and Summer and [[Geffen Records]] parted ways in 1988. The album was released in Europe in March 1989 on [[Warner Bros.
