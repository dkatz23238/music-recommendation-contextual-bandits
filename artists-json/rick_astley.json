He composed the track in the style of [[Whitney Houston]]'s hit, \"[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)|I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)]]\" in an effort to win the confidence of Waterman, who was a huge fan of Houston's song.<ref name=\":2\" /> It was another successful single, reaching No. 6 on both the UK and US charts. \n\n\"[[Take Me to Your Heart (Rick Astley song)|Take Me to Your Heart]]\" was the next single to be released from the album. It was one of four songs written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman that were belatedly added to the album in order to help Astley make his release deadline following the fire.<ref name=\":2\" /> These four tracks were written and produced in just two days, with writer [[Matt Aitken]] confirming \"Take Me to Your Heart\" was inspired by [[house music]] act [[Inner City (band)|Inner City]]'s 1988 hit, \"[[Big Fun (Inner City song)|Big Fun]]\".<ref name=\":2\" /> The single reached No. 8 in the UK and was not released in the US. \n\n\"[[Hold Me in Your Arms (Rick Astley song)|Hold Me in Your Arms]]\", a ballad written by Astley, reached No. 10 in the UK and was also not released in North America. The next two singles released from the album were intended for the North American market. \"[[Giving Up on Love]]\" and a cover of [[The Temptations]] song \"[[Ain't Too Proud To Beg]]\" charted at No. 38 and No. 89 in the US respectively.\n\nIn December 1989, Astley set off on his first world tour, touring 15 countries including the UK, US, Australia, and Japan.<ref name=\"RickBio\"/> By the end of the tour, he was tired of the negative press and wanted to explore alternative paths as a musician. He left Stock Aitken Waterman and RCA Records bought out his contract with PWL.\n\n===1990\u20131993: Switch to soul and adult contemporary and career break===\nBy 1990, Astley decided to leave his dance-pop days behind him, moving towards his passion, soul. This shift in musical genre led him to change his image, ditching the [[Boy next door (stock character)|boy next door]] look, growing his hair, and presenting himself as a mature and passionate musician. His third album, ''[[Free (Rick Astley album)|Free]]'', was released in 1991 and contained collaborations with [[Elton John]].<ref name=\"talktalk\"/> It had three singles and reached No 9 in the UK and No 31 in the US.\n\nHe achieved one more major success with his 1991 ballad \"[[Cry for Help]]\", which reached No 7 in both the UK and the US. The other two singles from ''Free'' were not as successful. \"[[Move Right Out]]\" reached No 58 in the UK and No 81 in the US, and \"[[Never Knew Love (Rick Astley song)|Never Knew Love]]\" reached No 70 in the UK and did not chart in the US. ''Free'' marked the end of Astley's successful period, and \"Cry for Help\" was the last Astley single to make the Top 10 in either the UK or US.\n\nHis next album, ''[[Body & Soul (Rick Astley album)|Body and Soul]]'', was released in 1993, and was largely an [[Adult Contemporary]] album. By the time the album was released, Astley had decided to retire from the music industry. As a result, the album did not get much promotion,<ref name=\"RickBio\"/> not charting in the UK but managing to make the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at No 182. The two singles, \"[[The Ones You Love]]\" and \"[[Hopelessly]],\" performed very well on the US adult contemporary chart, peaking at No 19 and No 4 respectively. \"The Ones You Love\" peaked at No 48 in the UK but did not chart in the US. \"Hopelessly\" also crossed over and peaked at No 28 on the US Billboard 100, staying in the US top 40 for five weeks, and No 33 in the UK. It was the last hit to chart on the [[Top 40]] in the UK and US.

The meme is a type of [[bait and switch]] using a disguised [[hyperlink]] that leads to the ''Never Gonna Give you Up ''music video. When victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was expected, and in doing so they are said to have been \"Rickrolled\". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics in unexpected places. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicized events, particularly when [[YouTube]] used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/03/31/youtube-rickrolls-users/|title=YouTube RickRolls Users|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|access-date=1 June 2008|archive-date=29 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829200506/http://techcrunch.com/2008/03/31/youtube-rickrolls-users/|url-status=live}}</ref> Rickrolling saw a massive resurgence online in the early 2020s. In online classes on [[Zoom (software)|Zoom]] during the worldwide [[COVID-19 lockdowns|COVID-19 lockdown]], students often rickrolled their classmates and teachers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=You Can Now 'Rick Roll' Your Zoom Meetings|url=https://nerdist.com/article/you-can-now-rick-roll-your-zoom-meetings/|access-date=4 March 2021|website=Nerdist}}</ref> A 4K remaster of the \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" music video went viral in early 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 February 2021|title=Rick Astley's Rick Roll meme goes viral again with disturbing 4K remaster|url=https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/rick-astleys-rick-roll-meme-goes-viral-again-with-disturbing-4k-remaster-1517065/|access-date=4 March 2021|website=Dexerto|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=18 February 2021|title=Rickroll your eyeballs into oblivion with remastered \"Never Gonna Give You Up\": Watch|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2021/02/rick-astley-never-gonna-give-you-up-remastered/|access-date=4 March 2021|website=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Astley, who had only recently returned to performing after a 10-year hiatus, was hesitant about using his newfound popularity from the meme to further his career, but accepted the fame when he Rickrolled the 2008 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] with a surprise performance of the song. Since then, Astley has seen his performance career revitalised by the meme's popularity. In an interview, Astley stated that one of his favourite Rickroll videos is \"BarackRoll\", a rickroll featuring clips from rallies by [[Barack Obama]] during his [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|2008 presidential campaign]], edited to make it look as though he is singing \"Never Gonna Give You Up\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=News|first=Taiwan|title=Astley never stops appreciating 'Never Gonna Give You Up' {{!}} Taiwan News {{!}} 22 October 2016 00:36:32|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3004212|access-date=7 September 2021|website=Taiwan News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Video Pick: Obama 'Sings' Rick Astley's Hit|language=en-US|work=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/08/obamas-never-go/|access-date=7 September 2021|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=20 October 2008|title=The Rickroll Gets Political|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/19914/rickroll-gets-political|access-date=7 September 2021|website=www.mentalfloss.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=metrowebukmetro|date=9 October 2008|title=John McCain Gets BarackRoll'd|url=https://metro.co.uk/2008/10/09/john-mccain-gets-barackrolld-9229/|access-date=7 September 2021|website=Metro|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAstley himself has been rickrolled a few times; in fact, the first time he was rickrolled actually pre-dated the viral phenomenon.
