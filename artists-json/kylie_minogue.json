[[List of awards and nominations received by Kylie Minogue|Her accolades]] include a [[Grammy Award]], three [[Brit Awards]] and 17 [[ARIA Music Awards]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Melbourne]], Minogue first achieved recognition starring in the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', playing tomboy mechanic [[Charlene Robinson]]. She gained prominence as a recording artist in the late 1980s and released four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums produced by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]. By the early 1990s, she had amassed several top ten singles in the UK and Australia, including \"[[I Should Be So Lucky]]\", \"[[The Loco-Motion]]\", \"[[Hand on Your Heart]]\", and \"[[Better the Devil You Know]]\". Taking more creative control over her music, Minogue signed with [[Deconstruction Records]] in 1993 and released ''[[Kylie Minogue (album)|Kylie Minogue]]'' (1994) and ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' (1997), both of which received positive reviews. She returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with 2000's ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'', including the number-one hits \"[[Spinning Around]]\" and \"[[On a Night Like This]]\". The follow-up, ''[[Fever (Kylie Minogue album)|Fever]]'' (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. Two of its singles, \"[[Love at First Sight (Kylie Minogue song)|Love at First Sight]]\" and \"[[In Your Eyes (Kylie Minogue song)|In Your Eyes]]\", became hits, but its lead single, \"[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\" became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units.\n\nMinogue continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her subsequent albums, which spawned successful singles such as \"[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]\", \"[[2 Hearts (Kylie Minogue song)|2 Hearts]]\", \"[[All the Lovers]]\", \"[[Santa Baby#Kylie Minogue version|Santa Baby]]\", \"[[Timebomb (Kylie Minogue song)|Timebomb]]\" and \"[[Dancing (Kylie Minogue song)|Dancing]]\". With her 2020 album ''[[Disco (Kylie Minogue album)|Disco]]'', she became the first female artist to have a chart-topping album in the UK for five consecutive decades. Minogue made her film debut in ''[[The Delinquents (1989 film)|The Delinquents]]'' (1989) and portrayed [[Cammy]] in ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'' (1994). She has also appeared in the films ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001), ''[[Jack & Diane (film)|Jack & Diane]]'', ''[[Holy Motors]]'' (2012) and ''[[San Andreas (film)|San Andreas]]'' (2015). In 2014, she appeared as a judge on the third series of ''[[The Voice UK (series 3)|The Voice UK]]'' and ''[[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]]''. Her other ventures include product endorsements, children's books, fashion, and charitable work.\n\nMinogue was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[2008 New Year Honours]] for services to music. She was appointed by the French government as a Chevalier (knight) of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture. In 2005, while Minogue was on tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Health Science]] (D.H.Sc.) degree by [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in 2011 for her work in raising awareness for breast cancer. At the 2011 [[ARIA Music Awards]], she was inducted by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]]. She was appointed [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] (AO) in the [[2019 Australia Day Honours]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Australia Day honours list: Kylie Minogue and Peter Reith among 2019 recipients |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/25/australia-day-honours-list-kylie-minogue-and-peter-reith-among-2019-recipients |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 January 2019 |access-date=2 September 2021}}</ref> [[Net worth]] of Kylie Minogue is A$109&nbsp;million (2020 estimate).<ref name=\"fortune\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/how-kylie-minogue-is-cashing-in-on-her-109-million-fortune/ORIP5LSKLSQE5UHAPNDR6RF5PM/|title=How Kylie Minogue is cashing in on her $109 million fortune|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=1 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008155221/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/how-kylie-minogue-is-cashing-in-on-her-109-million-fortune/ORIP5LSKLSQE5UHAPNDR6RF5PM/|archive-date=8 October 2020|url-status=live|first=Alison|last=Boshoff}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1968\u20131986: Early life and career beginnings===\nKylie Ann Minogue was born in [[Melbourne]] on 28 May 1968,<ref>{{harvnb|Hartley|1992|page=218}}</ref> the daughter of former ballet dancer  Carol Ann Minogue ([[n\u00e9e]] Jones) and car company accountant Ronald Charles Minogue.<ref name=\"Smith11-13\">{{harvnb|Smith|2014|pp=11, 13}}</ref><ref name=\"flyhigh\">{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/flying-high-with-mum-in-the-wings-20061111-gdoszf.html|title=Flying high with mum in the wings|date=11 November 2006|access-date=11 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008162652/https://www.smh.com.au/national/flying-high-with-mum-in-the-wings-20061111-gdoszf.html|archive-date=8 October 2020|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|first=Andrew|last=Hornery}}</ref> Minogue is of English and Welsh descent (though her surname is of Irish origin),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/kylies-welsh-roots-revealed-2391809|work=[[Media Wales|WalesOnline]]|title=Kylie's Welsh roots revealed|date=4 June 2005|access-date=4 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201205222331/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/kylies-welsh-roots-revealed-2391809|archive-date=5 December 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and was named after the [[Nyungar language|Nyungar]] word for \"[[Boomerang#Related terms|boomerang]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Goodall|Stanley-Clarke|2012|page=20}}</ref> She is the eldest of three children: her brother, Brendan Minogue, is a news cameraman in Australia, and her sister, [[Dannii Minogue]], followed her steps and is a singer and television host.<ref name=\"survivor\">{{Cite news|title=Pop princess is a survivor|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=17 May 2005|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/People/Pop-princess-is-a-survivor/2005/05/17/1116095959462.html|access-date=26 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050519015414/http://www.smh.com.au/news/People/Pop-princess-is-a-survivor/2005/05/17/1116095959462.html|archive-date=19 May 2005|url-status=live}}</ref> The family frequently moved around various suburbs in Melbourne to sustain their living expenses, which Minogue found unsettling as a child.
