Previously, the name \"God Speed You Black Emperor!\" had been used by Menuck on a limited cassette entitled ''[[All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling]]'' that had been recorded the year prior, with limited contributions by Pezzente on bass, although it would not be until 1994 that the actual band formed.\n\nThe band quickly expanded and continued to perform live. According to Menuck, joining the group was quite simple: \"It was like if anyone knew anybody who played an instrument and seemed like an okay person, they would sort of join up.\"<ref name=\"brainwashed1\">{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/deadmetheney/interviews/amazeine.htm|title=Godspeed You!

Local musicians would often join the band for a handful of performances, then depart. The revolving door nature of the group's membership frequently caused it strain before the release of ''[[F\u266f A\u266f \u221e]]''.<ref name=\"brainwashed1\"/>  After that release, the group stabilized around a nine-person lineup with Menuck, Moya and [[David Bryant (musician)|David Bryant]] on guitars, Pezzente and Thierry Amar on bass guitars, Aidan Girt and Bruce Cawdron on drums, and Sophie Trudeau and Norsola Johnson on violin and cello respectively.  Moya would depart in 1998 to focus on [[H\u1e5a\u1e62\u1e6cA]], being replaced by Roger Tellier-Craig of [[Fly Pan Am]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Godspeed You !

When the local police appeared, the group was held until it could be questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Although the police were suspicious of the band's anti-government documents and some photos it had (such as those of oil rigs), they found no incriminating evidence.
