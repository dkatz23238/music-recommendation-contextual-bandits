The standalone single \"[[Chip Away the Stone]]\", also released in 1978, charted at number 77.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/>\n\n===Departures of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, ''Night in the Ruts'', and ''Rock in a Hard Place'' (1979\u20131984)===\nIn 1979, the band started work on their next album, ''[[Night in the Ruts]]'', but Aerosmith decided to go on tour during a break in the recording schedule. As the decade was about to conclude, the band's drug use began taking its toll, and tensions were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to [[Cleveland Stadium]] on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the [[World Series of Rock]] festival. Pandemonium erupted backstage when Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument, Perry left Aerosmith (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). Upon his departure, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure, Perry formed his own side project known as [[The Joe Perry Project]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /><ref name=\"Aerosmith: Biography: Rolling Stone\" />\n\nSince there was still work to be done on ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith needed fill-in musicians to take Perry's place on the songs that needed to be recorded to complete the album. Guitarist Brad Whitford took over some of the lead parts, and [[Richard Supa|Richie Supa]], the band's longtime writing partner, filled in where needed until the band was able to hire [[Jimmy Crespo]] to take over as the next full-time guitarist. ''Night in the Ruts'' was released in November 1979, but only managed to sell enough records to be certified gold at the time, although it would eventually sell enough copies to be certified platinum by 1994. The only single the album spawned, a cover of \"[[Remember (Walking in the Sand)]]\" by [[the Shangri-Las]], peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/>\n\nThe tour for ''Night in the Ruts'' commenced shortly thereafter, but the band found themselves playing in smaller and smaller venues than before due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached rock bottom in 1980, when he collapsed on stage during a show in [[Portland, Maine]], and did not get up for the remainder of the set.<ref>Davis, p. 371</ref> Also in 1980, Aerosmith released their first compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]''. While the compilation didn't chart very high initially, it gained popularity later, and went on to become the band's best selling album in the United States, with sales of 12 million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.<ref>Davis, pp. 373\u2013374</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Aerosmith began work on their next album, ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]'', which saw them reunite with producer Jack Douglas. However, after the first song for the album, \"[[Lightning Strikes (Aerosmith song)|Lightning Strikes]]\", was recorded, Brad Whitford left the band and formed a duo with [[Derek St. Holmes]], with whom he recorded a [[Whitford/St. Holmes|self-titled album]], which failed to garner much interest. Whitford later joined up with the Joe Perry Project and played with them in 1984.<ref>Davis, p. 378</ref>\n\nWith [[Rick Dufay]] taking Whitford's place, ''Rock in a Hard Place'' was released on August 27, 1982. The album reached number 32 on the Billboard 200 album chart.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> Only one single charted, the aforementioned \"Lightning Strikes\", which peaked at number 21 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/> As with the tour for ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues, and instead had to rely on filling clubs and theaters, which they struggled to do. At a homecoming arena show in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], Tyler and Perry reunited and got high backstage before the show. Tyler was so intoxicated that he collapsed on stage again and, like before, could not get up.<ref>Davis, p. 400</ref>\n\nOn February 14, 1984, Perry (by then divorced from his first wife Elissa) and Whitford saw Aerosmith perform at Boston's [[Orpheum Theatre (Boston)|Orpheum Theater]]. Shortly thereafter, discussions began to reintegrate the two into the band and several months later, the original members of Aerosmith officially reunited.<ref>Davis, p. 417</ref> Steven Tyler recalls:{{cquote|You should have felt the buzz the moment all five of us got together in the same room for the first time again.

While concerts on the tour were well-attended, it was plagued with several incidents, mostly attributed to drug abuse by band members.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> With their drug problems still not behind them, the group was signed to [[Geffen Records]], and began working on a comeback.<ref name=\"Biography.com\" /> Despite the band signing on to a new record company, the band's old label [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] continued to reap the benefits of Aerosmith's comeback, releasing the live companion albums ''[[Classics Live I and II]]'' and the collection ''[[Gems (Aerosmith album)|Gems]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Allmusic&nbsp;\u2013 ''Gems''&nbsp;\u2013 Review|first=Greg|last=Prato|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r181|pure_url=yes}} | access-date=April 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, the band released the album ''[[Done with Mirrors]]'', their first studio album since reuniting.

In 1986, Tyler completed a successful [[drug rehabilitation]] program, after an intervention by his fellow band members, a doctor, and manager [[Tim Collins (manager)|Tim Collins]], who believed that the band's future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated in time. The rest of the band members also completed drug rehab programs over the course of the next couple of years. According to the band's tell-all autobiography, Collins pledged in September 1986 that he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 if they all completed drug rehab.<ref>Davis, pp. 1\u201315</ref> Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of ''Done With Mirrors'', and as the band members became clean, they worked hard to make their next album a success.<ref>Davis, p. 454</ref>\n\n===''Permanent Vacation'' and ''Pump'' (1987\u20131991)===\n''[[Permanent Vacation (Aerosmith album)|Permanent Vacation]]'' was released in August 1987, becoming a major hit and the band's bestselling album in over a decade (selling 5 million copies in the US),<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> with all three of its singles (\"[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]\", \"[[Angel (Aerosmith song)|Angel]]\", and \"[[Rag Doll (Aerosmith song)|Rag Doll]]\") reaching the Top 20 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/> Steven Tyler reveals in his autobiography that the album was \"...the first one we ever did sober.\"<ref>Steven Tyler with David Dalton (2011) The Autobiography: Does the noise in my head bother you?.

While the group was initially hesitant to using outside songwriters, including Tyler being furious for Knight getting songwriting credits for changing one word (\"Rag Time\" became \"Rag Doll\"), the method paid off, as ''Permanent Vacation'' became the band's most successful album in a decade. The group went on [[Permanent Vacation Tour|a subsequent tour]] with labelmates [[Guns N' Roses]] (who have cited Aerosmith as a major influence), which was intense at times because of Aerosmith's new struggle to stay clean amidst Guns N' Roses' well-publicized, rampant drug use.<ref>Davis, pp. 460\u2013461</ref>\n{{Listen|filename=Aerosmith - Janie's Got a Gun.ogg|title=\"Janie's Got a Gun\"\n|description=Sample of \"[[Janie's Got a Gun]]\" by Aerosmith, from ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]'' (1989)\n|format=[[Ogg]]\n|pos=left}}\n\nAerosmith's next album was even more successful.
