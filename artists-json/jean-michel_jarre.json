He is a pioneer in the [[electronic music|electronic]], [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[New-age music|new-age]] genres, and is known for organising outdoor [[spectacle]]s featuring his music, accompanied by vast [[laser lighting display|laser displays]], large [[projector|projections]] and [[fireworks]].\n\nJarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including street performers, [[jazz]] musicians and the artist [[Pierre Soulages]]. But his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by [[Pierre Schaeffer]], a pioneer of [[musique concr\u00e8te]] at the [[Groupe de Recherches Musicales]].\n\nHis first mainstream success was the 1976 album ''[[Oxyg\u00e8ne]]''. Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 18&nbsp;million copies. ''Oxyg\u00e8ne'' was followed in 1978 by ''[[Equinoxe|\u00c9quinoxe]]'', and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the [[Place de la Concorde]], a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events.\n\nAs of 2004, Jarre had sold an estimated 80&nbsp;million albums and singles.<ref>{{cite web | title = Disques Dreyfus Announces the American Release of 'The Jean-Michel Jarre Collection' | url = http://www.dreyfusrecords.com/news_article_ns.php?l=0&n=18 | date = 17 February 2004 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080213180012/http://www.dreyfusrecords.com/news_article_ns.php?l=0&n=18 | archive-date = 13 February 2008 | website = [[Dreyfus Records]] | access-date = 5 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He was the first [[Western world|Western]] musician officially invited to perform in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and holds the [[List of highest-attended concerts|world record for the largest-ever audience at an outdoor event]] for his [[Moscow]] concert on 6 September 1997, which was attended by 3.5 million people.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, influences, and education===\nJean-Michel Jarre was born in [[Lyon]] on 24 August 1948, to Francette Pejot, a [[French Resistance]] member and [[concentration camp]] survivor, and composer [[Maurice Jarre]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sleeman|Taylor|Francis|2003|p=809.}}</ref><ref name=\"Steamroller\" /> His grandmother was [[Jewish]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yudilovitch |first1=Merav |title=Like a breath of fresh air |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3187516,00.html |access-date=15 August 2021 |work=Ynetnews |date=20 December 2005 |language=en}}</ref> When Jarre was five, his parents separated and his father moved to the United States, leaving him with his mother.<ref name=\"Smoothoperator\">{{Citation | title = Jean-Michel Jarre: Smooth operator | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/jean-michel-jarre-smooth-operator-557538.html | last = Stuart | first = Julia | date = 23 August 2004 | work = [[The Independent]] | access-date = 15 March 2009 | archive-date = 22 September 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110922073801/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/jean-michel-jarre-smooth-operator-557538.html | url-status = dead }}</ref> He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18.<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /> For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an [[oboe]] player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first tape recorder.<ref>{{Harvnb|Remilleux|1988|p=13}}</ref> From his vantage point high above the pavement, the young Jarre was able to observe [[street performer]]s at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Remilleux|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nJarre struggled with classical piano studies, although he later changed teachers and worked on his scales.<ref name=\"Hughesp303\">{{Harvnb|Hughes|Reader|2003|p=303}}</ref> A more general interest in musical instruments was sparked by his discovery at the [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]] flea market, where his mother sold antiques, of a [[Boris Vian]] [[Stroh violin|trumpet violin]]. He often accompanied his mother to Le Chat Qui P\u00eache (The Fishing Cat), a Paris [[jazz]] club run by one of her friends from her resistance years, where saxophonists [[Archie Shepp]] and [[John Coltrane]], and trumpet players [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]] and [[Chet Baker]] were regular performers. These early jazz experiences suggested to him that music may be \"descriptive, without lyrics\".<ref name=\"Steamroller\" /><ref name=\"Remilleuxp16\">{{Harvnb|Remilleux|1988|p=16}}</ref> He was also influenced by the work of French artist [[Pierre Soulages]], whose exhibition at the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] he attended. Soulages' paintings used multiple textured layers, and Jarre realised that \"for the first time in music, you could act as a painter with frequencies and sounds.\"<ref name=\"Steamroller\">{{cite AV media | people=Powell, Aubrey (director) | date=1997 | title=Making the Steamroller Fly | type=TV documentary}}</ref> He was also influenced by classical, modernist music; in a 2004 interview for ''[[The Guardian]]'', he spoke of the effect that a performance of [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' had upon him:\n\n{{blockquote|This is where Stravinsky created it in 1913, and it was a huge shock.
