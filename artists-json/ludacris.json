He formed his own record label, [[Disturbing tha Peace]] in the late 1990s, then signed with [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam South]], after he went on to become one of the first [[Southern hip hop|Dirty South]] rappers to achieve mainstream success with countless album releases. For his music, Ludacris has won three [[Grammy Awards]] and an [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Award]]. Starting out with a brief stint as a [[disc jockey|DJ]], he independently released his first album ''[[Incognegro]]'' in 1999 to local success, but achieved national attention the following year when the album was repackaged and re-released as his major label debut, ''[[Back for the First Time]]''. It contained the hit singles \"[[Southern Hospitality (song)|Southern Hospitality]]\" (featuring [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]]), which wasn\u2019t on Incognegro, and \"[[What's Your Fantasy]]\" (featuring [[Shawnna]]). In 2001, he released ''[[Word of Mouf]]'', followed by ''[[Chicken-n-Beer]]'' in 2003 and ''[[The Red Light District]]'' in 2004, all of which were certified multi-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). He took a more serious approach with his next two albums, ''[[Release Therapy]]'' (2006), and ''[[Theater of the Mind]]'' (2008). His next album, ''[[Battle of the Sexes (album)|Battle of the Sexes]]'', was released in 2010 and featured a return to the more lighthearted tone of his previous albums. His most recent album, ''[[Ludaversal]]'', was released on March 31, 2015.\n\nAs an actor, Ludacris is best known for his role as [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Tej Parker|Tej Parker]] in the [[The Fast and the Furious|''Fast and Furious'' film series]], with his first appearance in the franchise coming in 2003. His other notable roles include ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), ''[[Gamer (2009 film)|Gamer]]'' (2009), and ''[[New Year's Eve (2011 film)|New Year's Eve]]'' (2011). For his performance in the ensemble of ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'', Ludacris was co-awarded a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] and a [[Critic's Choice Award]] for Best Cast. In 2021, Bridges created his own children's musical television series for [[Netflix]] known as ''[[Karma's World]]'', in which he also served as a voice actor.<ref name=\"LudaKW0\" /><ref name=\"LudaKW1\" /><ref name=\"LudaKW2\" /><ref name=\"LudaKW3\" /><ref name=\"LudaKW4\" />\n\n==Early life==\nBorn Christopher Brian Bridges in [[Champaign, Illinois]], Ludacris moved to [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] as a teenager.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Kelley L.|title=Ludacris revels in holiday spirit|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-11-09/news/0711090360_1_fred-claus-chris-ludacris-bridges-def-jam|access-date=March 3, 2022|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 9, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010541/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-11-09/news/0711090360_1_fred-claus-chris-ludacris-bridges-def-jam|archivedate=October 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> After attending [[Oak Park River Forest High School]] in ninth grade, Ludacris moved to [[Centreville, Virginia]] and attended [[Centreville High School (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Centreville High School]] for one year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Scott|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/wp/2015/03/25/ludacris-tells-lindsay-czarniak-that-he-attended-centreville-high-school-for-a-year/|title=Ludacris tells Lindsay Czarniak that he attended Centreville High School for a year|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 25, 2015|accessdate=March 3, 2022|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402153801/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/wp/2015/03/25/ludacris-tells-lindsay-czarniak-that-he-attended-centreville-high-school-for-a-year/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He attended [[Banneker High School (College Park, Georgia)|Banneker High School]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and graduated in 1995.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> From 1998 to 1999, he studied music management at [[Georgia State University]].<ref>[http://www.music.gsu.edu/docs/Sounds%20Fall%202008.pdf Alumni Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604221302/http://www.music.gsu.edu/docs/Sounds%20Fall%202008.pdf |date=June 4, 2013 }}.

A huge pop hit (despite its steamy video and explicit, adult-oriented lyrical content and themes), it subsequently became a success at urban radio and BET, and is the only time he has produced two consecutive top 10 singles from a solo album, {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} except for ''[[Release Therapy]]'' (an unedited version of the video could only be viewed on BET's Uncut program). It was Ludacris' most sexual video yet, an [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] remix that featured [[Raphael Saadiq]] and sampled [[Tony! Toni! Tone!]]'s \"Whatever You Want\". Ludacris received his first [[Grammy Award]] with [[Usher Raymond|Usher]] and [[Lil Jon]] for their hit single \"[[Yeah! (Usher song)|Yeah!]]\". Ludacris next released \"[[Blow It Out (Ludacris song)|Blow It Out]]\", which was accompanied by a low-budget music video.\n\n===2004\u20132007: ''The Red Light District'' and ''Release Therapy''===\n[[File:Ludacriscrop.JPG|thumb|upright|Ludacris during a 2011 New Year's Day concert in a Miami Beach nightclub]]\nLudacris took a more mature approach to his fourth album ''[[The Red Light District]]''. Sohail Khalid helped produce this album with various artists such as [[T.I.]], [[Lil Flip]] and [[Bun B]]. Ludacris openly boasted that he may be the only rapper able to keep the Def Jam label afloat on the opening track. Ludacris filmed and recorded the single \"[[Get Back (Ludacris song)|Get Back]]\" in which he was featured as a muscle-bound hulk who was being annoyed by the media and warned critics to leave him alone. He first appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a special guest performing with musical guest [[Sum 41]] on a season 30 episode hosted by [[Paul Giamatti]]. He then recorded \"Get Back\" with Sum 41 to make a rock crossover single. The follow-up single was the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]''-inspired \"[[Number One Spot]]\". It was produced by New York City's [[WQHT|Hot 97]] personality [[DJ Green Lantern]]. It used the [[Quincy Jones]] sample of \"[[Soul Bossa Nova]]\" and sped it up to the tempo of Ludacris' rap flow. Featured artists on the album include [[Nas]], [[DJ Quik]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Trick Daddy]], [[Sleepy Brown]] and [[Disturbing tha Peace]] newcomers [[Bobby V]]alentino, Dolla Boi and Small World. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts.\n\nIn an issue of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', Ludacris was placed in the number nine spot for the most anticipated albums of 2006, for ''[[Release Therapy]]''. The album ''Release Therapy'' was released on September 26, 2006. Ludacris formatted the CD to have two sides: a ''Release'' side and a ''Therapy'' side on a single CD. Guest appearances include [[Pharrell Williams]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Field Mob]], [[Bobby V]]alentino, [[Pimp C]], [[C-Murder]] and [[Beanie Sigel]].

His second single, \"[[Grew Up a Screw Up]]\", featuring [[Young Jeezy]], dispels rumors that the two are or ever were in a dispute. His third single, \"[[Runaway Love (Ludacris song)|Runaway Love]]\", soon peaked at number one on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Rap Tracks]] and won Best Collaboration in the 2007 [[BET Awards]]. ''Release Therapy'' won the [[Best Rap Album]] award at the [[49th Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. His album then reached number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts with sales of 309,000 in its first week. With the release of this album, Ludacris marked a change in style in his career with his musical style. The new album itself features a departure of the lighthearted mood of his previous albums, and introduces a darker side. A change of hair accompanied this as he cut off his trademark braids for a more conventional \"fade\" cut. To promote the album, Ludacris returned to ''Saturday Night Live'' (as both host and musical guest) on November 18, 2006.\n\n===2008\u20132010: ''Theater of the Mind'' and ''Battle of the Sexes''===\n''[[DJ Drama Presents: The Preview|The Preview]]'', a mixtape to preview the album was released on July 28, 2008.
