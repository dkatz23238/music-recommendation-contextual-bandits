Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 [[South by Southwest]] festival, he was signed to [[Aware Records]], and eventually to [[Columbia Records]], which released his first [[extended play]] ''[[Inside Wants Out]]''. His following two studio albums\u2014''[[Room for Squares]]'' (2001) and ''[[Heavier Things]]'' (2003)\u2014performed well commercially, achieving [[Music recording certification|multi-platinum]] status. In 2003, he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for his single \"[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]\".\n\nBy 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and begun performing the [[blues]] and rock music that had originally influenced him as a musician. He collaborated with blues artists such as [[B.B. King]], [[Buddy Guy]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. Forming the [[John Mayer Trio]], he released a live album, ''[[Try!]]'', in 2005 and his third studio album ''[[Continuum (John Mayer album)|Continuum]]'' in 2006. Both albums received positive reviews, and ''Continuum'' earned Mayer a [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007]] [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. He also won [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for \"[[Waiting on the World to Change]]\". That album was followed by ''[[Battle Studies (album)|Battle Studies]]'' in 2009, a return to pop, with a Battle Studies World Tour.\n\nAfter having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on his fifth studio album, ''[[Born and Raised (John Mayer album)|Born and Raised]]'', which drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles#History|Laurel Canyon]]. However, the discovery of a [[granuloma]] on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel the planned tour. The album received a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released his sixth studio album, ''[[Paradise Valley (album)|Paradise Valley]]'', which incorporates [[country music]] influences. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/photos/top-new-acts-since-2000-1403561474-slideshow/| title=USA: Top 20 New Acts Since 2000| website=Yahoo!

[[Jeff Chimenti]], who has toured with the various spin-offs of the Dead since the 1990s, is the group's keyboardist. \n \nAlthough Mayer had been familiar with the music of the Grateful Dead since at least high school, he began to develop a strong interest in their music in 2011 after hearing their song ''[[Althea (Grateful Dead song)|Althea]]'' by chance on [[Pandora radio]]. In 2015, while the Dead's ''[[Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead|Fare Thee Well]]'' shows with [[Trey Anastasio]] were also being planned, Mayer performed \"Althea\" with Weir on [[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]], along with \"[[Truckin']]\". Weir was impressed with Mayer's take on the material and began planning to work with him after the Fare Thee Well shows, despite them being billed as something of finale for the band and its legacy. Weir discussed the genesis of the band and his thoughts about working with Mayer in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' in 2016:\n\n{{Blockquote|I was doing preliminary get-togethers with Trey, kicking around the material. Trey is also a monster musician. If I had to make a broad categorization, John is a classicist by nature. Trey is more of an iconoclast. They're both explorers, someone who's happy to break tradition. Juxtaposing Trey's take on the material with the insights John brings got me looking at all of the songs afresh.\n\nI look forward to playing with Trey again, any old time. But I am really eager to get back out with John-boy and chase the music around, get to know each other. When that dream came to me, it was at about that point that I started to realize that I was feeling comfortable with knowing that John had moved, musically speaking \u2013 being able to intuit the songs.
