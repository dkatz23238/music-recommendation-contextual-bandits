Instead, it debuted at No. 1, above Jackson's \"[[Man in the Mirror]]\". The song went on to the top five in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as top ten in many more. The song was released in the U.S. in late September release, and peaked at 25 in seventeen weeks, making it the group's second top-forty hit.\n[[File:Cascada Logo.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.7|Cascada's logo]]\nThe song has become a club staple, used in many dance-oriented video games, and even nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award]].

The album continued Cascada's progression into electro-pop, the change was welcomed by mainstream audiences and fans, yet many fans still missed the euro-pop feel they considered integral to the Cascada project. The album itself did not mirror the success of the single, yet it did chart in the top ten of many countries, including the UK where it went on to sell 100,000 copies. \"[[Dangerous (Cascada Song)|Dangerous]]\" and \"[[Fever (Cascada song)|Fever]]\" were follow-up singles released from the album, the former in the UK, and the latter in the US, Australia, and the rest of Europe, neither experiencing success in terms of radio spins, digital, or physical sales.
