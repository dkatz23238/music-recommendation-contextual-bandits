The Flames' dynamic gospel-tinged vocals, polished choreography and timing as well as Brown's energetic dance moves and high-octane singing upstaged the proposed closing act, [[the Rolling Stones]].\n\nHaving signed a new deal with King, Brown released his song \"[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]\" in 1965, which became his first top ten pop hit and won him his first [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=\"pc51\" /> Brown also signed a production deal with [[Loma Records]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=June 5, 1965|title=Turners, Brown, Ink With Loma|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/60s/1965/CB-1965-06-05.pdf|magazine=Cash Box|pages=36}}</ref> Later in 1965, he issued \"[[I Got You (I Feel Good)|I Got You]]\", which became his second single in a row to reach number-one on the R&B chart and top ten on the pop chart. Brown followed that up with the ballad \"[[It's a Man's Man's Man's World]]\", a third Top 10 Pop hit (No. 1 R&B) which confirmed his stance as a top-ranking performer, especially with R&B audiences from that point on.<ref name=\"pc51\" />\n\n===1967\u20131970: Soul Brother No. 1===\n[[File:James Brown Music Scene 1969.jpg|thumb|left|Brown performing in 1969]]\nBy 1967, Brown's emerging sound had begun to be defined as funk music. That year he released what some critics cited as the first true funk song, \"[[Cold Sweat]]\", which hit number-one on the R&B chart (Top 10 Pop) and became one of his first recordings to contain a drum [[Break (music)|break]] and also the first that featured a harmony that was reduced to a single [[chord progression|chord]].<ref>George, N.

By this time Brown's vocals frequently took the form of a kind of rhythmic declamation, not quite sung but not quite spoken, that only intermittently featured traces of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] or [[melody]]. This would become a major influence on the techniques of [[rapping]], which would come to maturity along with [[hip hop music]] in the coming decades. Brown's style of funk in the late 1960s was based on interlocking syncopated parts: strutting bass lines, syncopated drum patterns, and iconic percussive guitar riffs.<ref>Slutsky, Allan, Chuck Silverman (1997). ''The Funkmasters-the Great James Brown Rhythm Sections''. {{ISBN|1576234436}}.</ref> The main guitar ostinatos for \"[[Ain't It Funky]]\" and \"[[Give It Up or Turnit a Loose]]\" (both 1969), are examples of Brown's refinement of [[New Orleans]] funk; irresistibly danceable riffs, stripped down to their rhythmic essence. On both recordings, the tonal structure is bare bones. The pattern of attack points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches as if the guitar were an African drum or idiophone. Alexander Stewart states that this popular feel was passed along from \"New Orleans\u2014through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s\".<ref>Stewart, Alexander (2000: 306). \"Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music\". ''Popular Music'', v. 19, n. 3. October 2000, pp. 293\u2013318.</ref> Those same tracks were later resurrected by countless hip-hop musicians from the 1970s onward. As a result, James Brown remains to this day the world's most [[sampling (music)|sampled]] recording artist, but, two tracks that he wrote, are also synonymous with modern dance, especially with [[house music]], [[jungle music]], and [[drum and bass music]], (which were sped up exponentially, in the latter two genres).\n\n\"Bring it Up\" has an Afro-Cuban [[guajeo]]-like structure. All three of these guitar riffs are based on an onbeat/offbeat structure. Stewart says that it \"is different from a [[bell pattern|time line]] (such as [[clave (rhythm)|clave]] and [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]]) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.\"<ref>Stewart (2000: 306).</ref>\n\n[[File:James Brown Mark III.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Brown poses with his 1969 [[Lincoln Continental Mark III]] and [[Learjet 23]] ]]\n\nIt was around this time as the musician's popularity increased that he acquired the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]] \"Soul Brother No. 1\", after failing to win the title \"King of Soul\" from [[Solomon Burke]] during a Chicago gig two years prior.<ref>Peter Guralnick, \"Song of Solomon\", ''The Boston Phoenix'' (March 6, 1984), Section 3:3.</ref> Brown's recordings during this period influenced musicians across the industry, most notably groups such as [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Funkadelic]], [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band]], [[Booker T. & the M.G.s]] as well as vocalists such as [[Edwin Starr]], [[David Ruffin]] and [[Dennis Edwards]] from [[The Temptations]], and [[Michael Jackson]], who, throughout his career, cited Brown as his ultimate idol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/jackson-attends-browns-public-funeral_1017673 |title=James Brown \u2013 Jackson Attends Brown's Public Funeral | access-date=July 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBrown's band during this period employed musicians and arrangers who had come up through the jazz tradition. He was noted for his ability as a bandleader and songwriter to blend the simplicity and drive of R&B with the rhythmic complexity and precision of [[jazz]]. Trumpeter Lewis Hamlin and saxophonist/keyboardist [[Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis]] (the successor to previous bandleader Nat Jones) led the band. Guitarist [[Jimmy Nolen]] provided percussive, deceptively simple [[riff]]s for each song, and [[Maceo Parker]]'s prominent saxophone solos provided a focal point for many performances. Other members of Brown's band included stalwart Famous Flames singer and sideman Bobby Byrd, trombonist [[Fred Wesley]], drummers [[John \"Jabo\" Starks]], [[Clyde Stubblefield]] and [[Melvin Parker]], saxophonist [[St. Clair Pinckney]], guitarist Alphonso \"Country\" Kellum and bassist [[Bernard Odum]].\n\nIn addition to a torrent of singles and studio albums, Brown's output during this period included two more successful live albums, ''[[Live at the Garden (James Brown album)|Live at the Garden]]'' (1967) and ''[[Live at the Apollo, Volume II]]'' (1968), and a 1968 television special, ''[[James Brown: Man to Man]]''. His music empire expanded along with his influence on the music scene. As Brown's music empire grew, his desire for financial and artistic independence grew as well. Brown bought radio stations during the late 1960s, including [[WCHZ (AM)|WRDW]] in his native Augusta, where he shined shoes as a boy.<ref name=\"pc51\">{{Pop Chronicles|51|5}}</ref> In November 1967, James Brown purchased radio station [[WEMG (Tennessee)|WGYW]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], for a reported $75,000, according to the January 20, 1968 ''[[Record World]]'' magazine. The call letters were changed to WJBE reflecting his initials. WJBE began on January 15, 1968, and broadcast a Rhythm & Blues format. The station slogan was \"WJBE 1430 Raw Soul\". Brown also bought [[WQLL|WEBB]] in [[Baltimore]] in 1970.\n\nBrown branched out to make several recordings with musicians outside his own band. In an attempt to appeal to the older, more affluent, and predominantly white [[adult contemporary]] audience, Brown recorded ''Gettin' Down To It'' (1969) and ''[[Soul on Top]]'' (1970)\u2014two albums consisting mostly of romantic ballads, jazz standards, and homologous reinterpretations of his earlier hits\u2014with the Dee Felice Trio and the [[Louie Bellson]] Orchestra. In 1968, he recorded a number of funk-oriented tracks with [[The Dapps]], a white [[Cincinnati]] band, including the hit \"[[I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)|I Can't Stand Myself]]\". He also released three albums of [[Christmas music]] with his own band.\n\n===1970\u20132006: Godfather of Soul===\n{{main|The J.B.'s}}\nIn March 1970, most of Brown's mid-to-late 1960s road band walked out on him due to financial disputes, a development augured by the prior disbandment of The Famous Flames singing group for the same reason in 1968. Brown and erstwhile Famous Flames singer Bobby Byrd (who chose to remain in the band during this tumultuous period as co-frontman, effectively serving as a proto-[[hype man]] in live performances) subsequently recruited several members of [[The Pacemakers (funk band)|The Pacemakers]], a Cincinnati-based ensemble that included bassist [[Bootsy Collins]] and his brother, guitarist [[Catfish Collins|Phelps \"Catfish\" Collins]]; augmented by the remaining members of the 1960s road band (including Fred Wesley, who rejoined Brown's outfit in December 1970) and other newer musicians, they would form the nucleus of [[The J.B.'s]], Brown's new backing ensemble. Shortly following their first performance together, the band entered the studio to record the Brown-Byrd composition, \"[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]\"; the song and other contemporaneous singles would further cement Brown's influence in the nascent genre of funk music. This iteration of the J.B.'s dissolved after a March 1971 European tour (documented on the 1991 archival release ''[[Love Power Peace]]'') due to additional money disputes and Bootsy Collins's use of [[LSD]]; a new lineup of the J.B.'s coalesced around Wesley, St. Clair Pinckney and drummer John Starks.\n[[File:James Brown & Lars Jacob 1972.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Brown with a disc jockey after a concert in [[Tampa]] in 1972]]\nIn 1971, Brown began recording for [[Polydor Records]]. Many of his sidemen and supporting players, including Fred Wesley & the J.B.'s, Bobby Byrd, [[Lyn Collins]], [[Vicki Anderson]] and former rival [[Hank Ballard]], released records on the [[People Records|People]] label.\n\nDuring the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], James Brown openly proclaimed his support of [[Richard Nixon]] for reelection to the presidency over Democratic candidate [[George McGovern]].<ref>{{cite web |title=James Brown: Soul Survivor |work=American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=October 29, 2003 |access-date=October 28, 2011 |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/james-brown/soul-survivor/532/}}</ref> The decision led to a boycott of his performances and, according to Brown, cost him a big portion of his black audience.{{sfn|Brown|Tucker|1986|p=233}} As a result, Brown's record sales and concerts in the United States reached a lull in 1973 as he failed to land a number-one R&B single that year. That year he also faced problems with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] for failure to pay [[back taxes]], charging he hadn't paid upwards of $4.5 million; five years earlier, the IRS had claimed he owed nearly $2 million.<ref name=\"jbencyclopedia\" />\n[[File:James-Brown 1973.jpg|thumb|right|Brown performing in 1973]]\nIn 1973, Brown provided the score for the [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]''. In 1974 he returned to the No. 1 spot on the R&B charts with \"[[The Payback (song)|The Payback]]\", with the [[The Payback|parent album]] reaching the same spot on the album charts; he would reach No. 1 two more times in 1974, with \"[[My Thang]]\" and \"[[Papa Don't Take No Mess]]\".{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n\n\"Papa Don't Take No Mess\" would prove to be his final single to reach the No. 1 spot on the R&B charts and his final Top 40 pop single. His Top Ten R&B hits during this latter period included \"[[Funky President (People It's Bad)|Funky President]]\" (R&B No. 4) and \"[[Get Up Offa That Thing]]\" (R&B No. 4).\n\n[[File:James Brown (1977).jpg|thumb|upright|James Brown (1977)]]\nAlthough his records were mainstays of the vanguard New York underground [[disco]] scene (exemplified by DJs such as [[David Mancuso]] and [[Francis Grasso]]) from 1969 onwards, Brown did not consciously yield to the trend until 1975's ''[[Sex Machine Today]]''. By 1977, he was no longer a dominant force in R&B. After \"Get Up Offa That Thing\", thirteen of Brown's late 1970s recordings for Polydor failed to reach the Top 10 of the R&B chart, with only \"[[Bodyheat]]\" in 1976 and the disco-oriented \"[[It's Too Funky in Here]]\" in 1979 reaching the R&B Top 15 and the ballad \"[[Kiss in '77]]\" reaching the Top 20. After 1976's \"Bodyheat\", he also failed to appear on the Billboard Hot 100. As a result, Brown's concert attendance began dropping and his reported disputes with the IRS caused his business empire to collapse. In addition, several longtime bandmates (including Wesley and Maceo Parker) had gradually pivoted to Parliament-Funkadelic, which reached its critical and commercial apogee in the mid-to-late 1970s. The emergence of disco also forestalled Brown's success on the R&B charts because its slicker, more commercial style had superseded his rawer, one-chord funk productions.\n\nBy the release of 1979's ''The Original Disco Man'', Brown seldom contributed to the songwriting and production processes, leaving most of it to producer [[Brad Shapiro]]; this resulted in the song \"It's Too Funky in Here\" becoming Brown's most successful single in this period. After two more albums failed to chart, Brown left Polydor in 1981. It was around this time that Brown changed the name of his band from the J.B.'s to the Soul Generals (or Soul G's). The band retained that name until his death. \n\nDespite Brown's declining record sales, promoters Gary LoConti and Jim Rissmiller helped Brown sell out a string of residency shows at the [[Reseda Country Club]] in [[Los Angeles]] in early 1982. Brown's compromised commercial standing prevented him from charging a large fee. However, the great success of these shows marked a turning point for Brown's career, and soon he was back on top in Hollywood. Movies followed, including appearances in ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'' (1983) and ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985). He also guest-starred in the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' episode \"Missing Hours\" (1987). Previously, Brown appeared alongside a litany of other Black musical luminaries in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980).\n\nIn 1984, he teamed with rap musician [[Afrika Bambaataa]] on the song \"[[Unity (Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown song)|Unity]]\". A year later he signed with [[Scotti Brothers Records]] and issued the moderately successful album ''[[Gravity (James Brown album)|Gravity]]'' in 1986. It included Brown's final Top Ten pop hit, \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\", marking his first Top 40 entry since 1974 and his first Top Ten pop entry since 1968. Produced and written by [[Dan Hartman]], it was also featured prominently on the ''Rocky IV'' film and soundtrack. Brown performed the song in the film at Apollo Creed's final fight, shot in the Ziegfeld Room at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and was credited in the film as \"The Godfather of Soul\". 1986 also saw the publication of his autobiography, ''James Brown: The Godfather of Soul'', co-written with Bruce Tucker. In 1987, Brown won the Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \"Living in America\".\n\nIn 1988, Brown worked with the production team [[Full Force]] on the [[new jack swing]]-influenced ''[[I'm Real (James Brown album)|I'm Real]]''. It spawned his final two Top 10 R&B hits, \"[[I'm Real (James Brown song)|I'm Real]]\" and \"[[Static (song)|Static]]\", which peaked at No. 2 and No. 5, respectively. Meanwhile, the [[Break (music)#Break beat (element of music)|drum break]] from the second version of the original 1969 hit \"Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose\" (the recording included on the compilation album ''[[In the Jungle Groove]]'') became so popular at hip hop dance parties (especially for [[break dancing|breakdance]]) during the early 1980s that hip hop pioneer  [[Kurtis Blow]] called the song \"the national anthem of hip hop\".<ref>[http://www.rhino.com/Features/liners/72851lin.html Liner notes \u2013 \"Kurtis Blow presents: The History of Rap, Volume I\"].

It included the single \"[[(So Tired of Standing Still We Got to) Move On]]\", which peaked at No. 48 on the R&B chart. His former record label Polydor also released the four-CD box set ''[[Star Time (album)|Star Time]]'', spanning Brown's career to date. Brown's release from prison also prompted his former record labels to [[reissue]] his albums on CD, featuring additional tracks and commentary by music critics and historians. That same year, Brown appeared on rapper [[MC Hammer]]'s video for \"[[Too Legit to Quit (song)|Too Legit to Quit]]\". Hammer had been noted, alongside [[Big Daddy Kane]], for bringing Brown's unique stage shows and their own energetic dance moves to the hip-hop generation; both listed Brown as their idol. Both musicians also sampled his work, with Hammer having sampled the rhythms from \"[[Super Bad (song)|Super Bad]]\" for his song \"Here Comes the Hammer\", from his best-selling album ''[[Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em]]''. Big Daddy Kane sampled many times. Before the year was over, Brown\u2013who had immediately returned to work with his band following his release\u2013organized a pay-per-view concert following a show at Los Angeles' [[Wiltern Theatre]], that was well received.\n\nOn June 10, 1991, James Brown and a star-filled line up performed before a crowd at the Wiltern Theatre for a live pay-per-view at-home audience. ''James Brown: Living in America \u2013 Live!'' was the brainchild of Indiana producer Danny Hubbard. It featured\n[[M.C. Hammer]] as well as [[Bell Biv Devoe]], [[Heavy D]] & the Boys, [[En Vogue]], [[C+C Music Factory]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Sherman Hemsley]] and [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]]. [[Ice-T]], [[Tone Loc]] and [[Kool Moe Dee]] performed paying homage to Brown. This was Brown's first public performance since his parole from the South Carolina prison system in February. He had served two-and-a-half years of two concurrent six-year sentences for aggravated assault and other felonies.\n\nBrown continued making recordings. In 1993 his album ''Universal James'' was released. It included his final ''Billboard'' charting single, \"[[Can't Get Any Harder]]\", which peaked at No. 76 on the US R&B chart and reached No. 59 on the UK chart. Its brief charting in the UK was probably due to the success of a remixed version of \"I Feel Good\" featuring [[Dakeyne]]. Brown also released the singles \"How Long\" and \"Georgia-Lina\", which failed to chart. In 1995, Brown returned to the [[Apollo Theater|Apollo]] and recorded ''[[Live at the Apollo 1995]]''. It included a studio track titled \"Respect Me\", which was released as a single; again it failed to chart. Brown's final studio albums, ''I'm Back'' and ''[[The Next Step (James Brown album)|The Next Step]]'', were released in 1998 and 2002 respectively. ''I'm Back'' featured the song \"[[Funk on Ah Roll]]\", which peaked at No. 40 in the UK but did not chart in his native US. ''The Next Step'' included Brown's final single, \"[[Killing Is Out, School Is In]]\". Both albums were produced by Derrick Monk. Brown's concert success, however, remained unabated and he kept up with a grueling schedule throughout the remainder of his life, living up to his previous nickname, \"The Hardest Working Man in Show Business\", in spite of his advanced age. In 2003, Brown participated in the [[PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' television documentary ''James Brown: Soul Survivor'', which was directed by [[Jeremy Marre]].\n\nBrown performed in the [[Super Bowl XXXI halftime show]] in 1997.\n\n[[File:James Brown 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|Brown during the [[NBA All-Star Game]] jam session, 2001]]\nBrown celebrated his status as an icon by appearing in a variety of entertainment and sports events, including an appearance on the [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] pay-per-view event, [[SuperBrawl X]], where he danced alongside wrestler [[Ernest Miller|Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller]], who based his character on Brown, during his in-ring skit with [[Robert Kellum|The Maestro]]. Brown then appeared in [[Tony Scott]]'s short film ''[[The Hire: Beat the Devil|Beat the Devil]]'' in 2001. He was featured alongside [[Clive Owen]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Danny Trejo]] and [[Marilyn Manson]]. Brown also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the 2002 [[Jackie Chan]] film ''[[The Tuxedo]]'', in which Chan was required to finish Brown's act after having accidentally knocked out the singer. In 2002, Brown appeared in ''[[Undercover Brother]]'', playing himself.\n[[File:Jamesbrown3.jpg|left|thumb|Brown performing in June 2005]]\nIn 2004, Brown opened for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] at several [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] concerts in London.<ref name=\"Fornication\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd1Mfte7wuEC&q=red%20hot%20chili%20peppers%20james%20brown%20hyde%20park&pg=PT507 | title=Fornication: The Red Hot Chili Peppers Story | publisher=Omnibus Press | author=Apter, Jeff | year=2004 | location=London | isbn=9781844493814}}</ref> The beginning of 2005 saw the publication of his second book, ''I Feel Good: A Memoir of a Life of Soul'', written with Marc Eliot.

His own stated goal was to \"give people more than what they came for&nbsp;\u2014 make them tired, 'cause ''that's'' what they came for.'\"<ref>Guralnick, 231.</ref> Brown's concert repertoire consisted mostly of his own hits and recent songs, with a few R&B covers mixed in. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the [[Mashed Potato (dance)|Mashed Potato]] into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides. In addition, his horn players and singing group (The Famous Flames) typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the Revue included backup dancers. Male performers in the Revue were required to wear [[Tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedoes]] and [[cummerbund]]s long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts. Brown's own extravagant outfits and his elaborate [[Conk|processed hairdo]] completed the visual impression. A James Brown concert typically included a performance by a featured vocalist, such as Vicki Anderson or [[Marva Whitney]], and an instrumental feature for the band, which sometimes served as the opening act for the show.\n\nA trademark feature of Brown's stage shows, usually during the song \"Please, Please, Please\", involved Brown dropping to his knees while clutching the microphone stand in his hands, prompting the show's longtime MC, Danny Ray, to come out, drape a cape over Brown's shoulders and escort him off the stage after he had worked himself to exhaustion during his performance. As Brown was escorted off the stage by the MC, Brown's vocal group, [[the Famous Flames]] ([[Bobby Byrd]], [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth|Lloyd Stallworth]], and [[Bobby Bennett (The Famous Flames)|Bobby Bennett]]), continued singing the background vocals \"Please, please don't go-oh\".<ref>Page, C.

Retrieved January 9, 2007.</ref> During some of his concert performances, Brown danced in front of his band with his back to the audience as he slid across the floor, flashing hand signals and splaying his pulsating fingers to the beat of the music. Although audiences thought Brown's dance routine was part of his act, this practice was actually his way of pointing to the offending member of his troupe who played or sang the wrong note or committed some other infraction. Brown used his splayed fingers and hand signals to alert the offending person of the fine that person must pay to him for breaking his rules.<ref>Gottschild, B.D.

As [[Fred Wesley]] recalled of his time as musical director of the JBs, if Brown felt intimidated by a support act he would try to \"undermine their performances by shortening their sets without notice, demanding that they not do certain showstopping songs, and even insisting on doing the unthinkable, playing drums on some of their songs. A sure set killer.\"<ref>Fred Wesley's sleevenotes to [[Honey & the Bees]] \"Dynamite!\" (Jamie4009) 1999.</ref>\n\n==Social activism==\n\n===Education advocacy and humanitarianism===\nBrown's main social activism was in preserving the need for education among youths, influenced by his own troubled childhood and his being forced to drop out of the seventh grade for wearing \"insufficient clothes\". Due to heavy dropout rates in the 1960s, Brown released the pro-education song, \"[[Don't Be a Drop-Out]]\". Royalties of the song were donated to dropout-prevention charity programs. The success of this led to Brown meeting with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] at the [[White House]]. Johnson cited Brown for being a positive role model to the youth. In 1968 James Brown endorsed Hubert Humphrey,<ref>[https://www.3blmedia.com/news/james-brown-and-super-bad-stakeholder-engagement James Brown and Super Bad] Retrieved 03 march 2022</ref> but later Brown gained the confidence of President Richard Nixon, to whom he found he had to explain the plight of Black Americans.<ref>{{YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the remainder of his life, Brown made public speeches in schools and continued to advocate the importance of education in school. Upon filing his will in 2002, Brown advised that most of the money in his estate go into creating the I Feel Good, Inc. Trust to benefit disadvantaged children and provide scholarships for his grandchildren. His final single, \"Killing Is Out, School Is In\", advocated against murders of young children in the streets. Brown often gave out money and other items to children while traveling to his childhood hometown of Augusta. A week before his death, while looking gravely ill, Brown gave out toys and turkeys to kids at an Atlanta orphanage, something he had done several times over the years.\n\n===Civil rights and self-reliance===\nThough Brown performed at benefit rallies for civil rights organizations in the mid-1960s, Brown often shied away from discussing civil rights in his songs in fear of alienating his crossover audience. In 1968, in response to a growing urge of [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war advocacy during the Vietnam War]], Brown recorded the song, \"[[America Is My Home]]\". In the song, Brown performed a [[rapping|rap]], advocating patriotism and exhorting listeners to \"stop pitying yoursel[ves] and get up and fight\". At the time of the song's release, Brown had been participating in performing for troops stationed in Vietnam.\n\n====The Boston Garden concert====\nOn April 5, 1968, a day after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in Memphis, Tennessee, Brown provided a free citywide televised concert at the [[Boston Garden]] to maintain public order and calm concerned Boston residents (over the objections of the police chief, who wanted to call off the concert, which he thought would incite violence).<ref name=\"pc51\" /> The show was later released on DVD as ''[[Live at the Boston Garden: April 5, 1968]]''. According to the documentary ''The Night James Brown Saved Boston'', then-mayor [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]] had strongly restrained the Boston police from cracking down on minor violence and protests after the assassination, while religious and community leaders worked to keep tempers from flaring.<ref name=\"vh1nightjbsavedbos\">[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_rock_docs/134183/episode_about.jhtml \"The Night James Brown Saved Boston\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310185153/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_rock_docs/134183/episode_about.jhtml |date=March 10, 2009 }}. ''VH1 rockDocs''.</ref> White arranged to have Brown's performance broadcast multiple times on Boston's public television station, [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], thus keeping potential rioters off the streets, watching the concert for free.<ref name=\"vh1nightjbsavedbos\" /> Angered by not being told of this, Brown demanded $60,000 for \"gate\" fees (money he thought would be lost from ticket sales on account of the concert being broadcast for free) and then threatened to go public about the secret arrangement when the city balked at paying up afterwards, news of which would have been a political death blow to White and spark riots of its own.<ref name=\"vh1nightjbsavedbos\" /> White eventually lobbied the behind-the-scenes power-brokering group known as \"The Vault\" to come up with money for Brown's gate fee and other social programs, contributing $100,000. Brown received $15,000 from them via the city. White also persuaded management at the Garden to give up their share of receipts to make up the differences.<ref name=\"vh1nightjbsavedbos\" /> Following this successful performance, Brown was counseled by President Johnson to urge cities ravaged from riots following King's assassination to not resort to violence, telling them to \"cool it, there's another way\".{{sfn|''Jet''|1971|p=54}}\n\nResponding to pressure from black activists, including [[H. Rap Brown]], to take a bigger stance on their issues and from footage of [[black on black crime]] committed in inner cities, Brown wrote the lyrics to the song \"[[Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\", which his bandleader [[Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis]] accompanied with a musical composition. Released late that summer, the song's lyrics helped to make it an anthem for the civil rights movement. Brown only performed the song sporadically following its initial release and later stated he had regrets about recording it, saying in 1984, \"Now 'Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud' has done more for the black race than any other record, but if I had my choice, I wouldn't have done it, because I don't like defining anyone by race. To teach race is to teach separatism.\"{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=95}} In his autobiography he stated:\n\n<blockquote>The song is obsolete now ... But it was necessary to teach pride then, and I think the song did a lot of good for a lot of people ... People called \"Black and Proud\" militant and angry \u2013 maybe because of the line about dying on your feet instead of living on your knees. But really, if you listen to it, it sounds like a children's song. That's why I had children in it, so children who heard it could grow up feeling pride ... The song cost me a lot of my crossover audience. The racial makeup at my concerts was mostly black after that. I don't regret it, though, even if it was misunderstood.{{sfn|Brown|Tucker|1986|p=280}}</blockquote>\n\nIn 1969, Brown recorded two more songs of social commentary, \"[[World (James Brown song)|World]]\" and \"[[I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing]]\", the latter song pleading for equal opportunity and self-reliance rather than entitlement. In 1970, in response to some black leaders for not being outspoken enough, he recorded \"[[Get Up, Get into It, Get Involved]]\" and \"[[Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing]]\". In 1971, he began touring Africa, including Zambia and Nigeria. He was made \"freeman of the city\" in [[Lagos, Nigeria]], by Oba Adeyinka Oyekan, for his \"influence on black people all over the world\".{{sfn|''Jet'' |1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7EDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59 59]}} With his company, James Brown Enterprises, Brown helped to provide jobs for blacks in business in the communities.{{sfn|''Jet'' |1971|p=60}} As the 1970s continued, Brown continued to record songs of social commentary, most prominently 1972's \"[[King Heroin]]\" and the two-part ballad \"Public Enemy\", which dealt with drug addiction.\n\n===Political views===\nDuring the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential campaign]], Brown endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Hubert Humphrey]] and appeared with Humphrey at political rallies. Brown was labeled an \"Uncle Tom\" for supporting Humphrey and also for releasing the pro-American funk song, \"America Is My Home\", in which Brown had lambasted protesters of the Vietnam War as well as the politics of pro-black activists. Brown began supporting [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president [[Richard Nixon]] after being invited to perform at Nixon's inaugural ball in January 1969.{{sfn|Brown|Tucker|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7KNUsxQPRB8C&pg=PA281 281]}} Brown's endorsement of Nixon during the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]] negatively impacted his career during that period with several national Black organizations boycotting his records and protesting at his concert shows;<ref>{{cite web|last=Penman|first=Ian|title=Did He Feel Good?|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2012/bc0608ip.html |work=City Journal |publisher=Manhattan Institute|access-date=December 22, 2013|date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> a November 1972 show in Cincinnati was picketed with signs saying, \"James Brown: Nixon's Clown\". Brown initially was invited to perform at a Youth Concert following Nixon's inauguration in January 1973 but bailed out due to the backlash he suffered from supporting Nixon. Brown joined fellow black entertainer [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], who faced similar backlash, to back out of the concert. Brown blamed it on \"fatigue\". Brown later reversed his support of Nixon and composed the song, \"You Can Have Watergate (Just Gimme Some Bucks And I'll Be Straight)\" as a result. After Nixon resigned from office, Brown composed the 1974 hit, \"Funky President (People It's Bad)\", right after [[Gerald Ford]] took Nixon's place. Brown later supported Democratic President [[Jimmy Carter]], attending one of Carter's inaugural balls in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Eugene|title=SOUL BROTHER NO. 1 JAMES BROWN ENDORSES RICHARD NIXON?
