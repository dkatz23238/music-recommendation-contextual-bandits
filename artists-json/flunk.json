Beginning as an instrumental and sampled-vocal project, they were signed for a track on a compilation by [[Beatservice Records]] in the winter of 2001. On hearing the finished track, label manager [[Vidar Hanssen]] signed the still-unnamed band for a full album.<ref name=\"Flunk\" />\n\nDuring the summer of 2001, the duo recorded most of the album and Vister improvised the vocals. Afterward, Bakke layered the guitars, but it would be a year before the album was completed and released.<ref name=\"Flunk\" />\n\nIn the spring of 2002, the band chose the name Flunk, and they released their first single, a cover of [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s \"[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]\", in April. The track was well received in the UK and was included on numerous compilations in North America and Europe. Later in April, their debut album, ''[[For Sleepyheads Only]]'', was released, garnering positive reviews in Norway. With the success of this record, the [[BBC]] invited the group to do a recording session for the [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show ''The Blue Room'' in London.

In 2005, the EP ''[[Play America]]'' was released on Beatservice Records and included bonus tracks from the US version of ''Morning Star'', along with remixes.<ref name=\"Flunk\" />\n\nIn 2007, Flunk released their third album, ''[[Personal Stereo]]'', while May 2009 saw the publication of ''This Is What You Get'', which includes a cover version of [[Radiohead]]'s \"[[Karma Police]]\".<ref name=\"Flunk\" />\n\nIn 2013, the band released their fifth studio album, ''Lost Causes''.
