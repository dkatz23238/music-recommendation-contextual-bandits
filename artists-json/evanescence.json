After recording independent albums, Evanescence released their first full-length album, ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]'', on [[Wind-up Records]] in 2003. On the strength of hit singles \"[[Bring Me to Life]]\" and \"[[My Immortal]]\", ''Fallen'' sold more than 17 million copies worldwide, and won the band two [[Grammy Award]]s out of six nominations. A year later, the band released their first live album and video release, ''[[Anywhere but Home]]'', which sold over one million copies worldwide. \n\nThe band released their second studio album, ''[[The Open Door]]'' in 2006, co-composed by Lee and guitarist [[Terry Balsamo]]. It sold more than five million copies worldwide, and received a Grammy nomination. They reconvened in June 2009 to work on music for their next album, with touring guitarist [[Troy McLawhorn]], bassist [[Tim McCord]] and drummer [[Will Hunt]] becoming full-time members. The band's third studio album, ''[[Evanescence (Evanescence album)|Evanescence]]'', was released in 2011. It debuted at the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref name=\"www.billboard.com\" /> and four other [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]: Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and Hard Rock Albums. Following the end of the album's tour cycle, the band entered a hiatus.\n\nIn 2015, Evanescence emerged from hiatus and announced they would resume touring into 2016 but new Evanescence material was not yet being created as Lee was focusing on a solo project. In March 2017, Lee stated that Evanescence was working on a fourth album, ''[[Synthesis (Evanescence album)|Synthesis]]'', which was released in November 2017. It includes [[orchestral|orchestrally]]\u2013reworked versions of the band's previous material with [[electronica]] elements. The album's release was followed by the [[Synthesis Live]] concert tour in which the band performed with a live orchestra for the first time. In 2021, the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[The Bitter Truth]]''.\n\nEvanescence's lineup changed several times over the years, with none of the band's five studio albums featuring the same lineup. Previous members include [[David Hodges]] (2000\u201302), guitarist Ben Moody (1995\u20132003), guitarist [[John LeCompt]] and drummer [[Rocky Gray]] (2003\u201307), and guitarist Terry Balsamo (2003-15). Lee is the sole constant member of the band since its inception, with its present lineup comprising Lee, guitarist Troy McLawhorn since 2007, guitarist Tim McCord since 2006, drummer Will Hunt since 2007, and bassist [[Emma Anzai]] on tour as of 2022.\n\n==History==\n\n===1995\u20132001: Formation and early years===\nEvanescence was founded in 1995 by singer, pianist, and songwriter Amy Lee and former lead guitarist and songwriter Ben Moody. The two met in 1994, when Lee was 13 and Moody 14, at a Christian youth camp in Little Rock, where Lee saw Moody playing acoustic guitar at the camp and thought they could play music together.{{refn|<ref name=\"blender705\">{{cite news |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=705 |title=Survivor! |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender magazine]] |first=Michael |last=Odell |date=April 2004 |access-date=October 18, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124062408/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=705 |archive-date=January 24, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Maerz\"/><ref name=\"Bream\">{{cite newspaper|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&dat=20061017&id=X38pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dWQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1174,2433366|title=No, says Evanescence singer Amy Lee|last=Bream|first=Jon|date=October 17, 2006|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston, Maine)|Sun Journal]]|accessdate=October 5, 2022}}</ref>}} Lee thinks what drew them together at the time was that they \"didn't fit in that well\" and were \"out of [their] element in this silly camp environment.\"<ref name=\"smh\"/> Lee brought Moody a cassette tape of her playing guitar and singing a song she wrote.
