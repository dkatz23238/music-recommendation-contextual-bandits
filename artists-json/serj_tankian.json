The band initially hired Shavo Odadjian as their manager before he was to transition into their rhythm guitarist.\nLaranio and Hakopyan later left the band feeling that it was not going anywhere, leading to Soil splitting up.\n\nAfter the split, Tankian, Odadjian and Malakian formed System of a Down, named after a poem Malakian wrote called Victims of a Down. The band recruited drummer Ontronik \"Andy\" Khachaturian, an old school friend of Malakian, and Odadjian who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens. In mid-1997, Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan). Khachaturian was replaced by John Dolmayan. Dolmayan is also the drummer for the band Indicator and former drummer for Scars on Broadway.\n\nThe band began touring the [[Southern California]] rock clubs, building a strong following.\n\nThe band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. System of a Down has been nominated for four [[Grammy Awards]], and their song \"[[B.Y.O.B.

Tankian said that collaborating on the show has been a great learning experience for him. \"I've been using a lot of my archives, a lot of different types of music that I had already put together for underscoring and what not,\" he said. \"It's quite diverse, from noise to jazz to electronic stuff to hip-hop songs to rock songs to cool, piano dark underscores, and that's a whole different bag of tricks there because it's always evolving. Unlike a film score that's very linear and you get a scene to score for, this is something where you do another workshop and one song is gone, that underscore changes to 20 seconds and they need something else on the spot.
