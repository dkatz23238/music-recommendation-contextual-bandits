The London interview was dubbed with a voiceover in the German language for broadcast on German television. John Byrne Cooke, road manager for Joplin and the Kozmic Blues Band, wrote a book published in 2014 in which he discussed her knowledge of the risks of her ongoing use of narcotics, particularly when she was outside the United States.<ref name=\"on the road\">{{Cite book |title=On the Road With Janis Joplin |first=John Byrne |last=Cooke |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-425-27411-8 }}</ref>\n\nOn the episode of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' that was telecast in the United States on the night of July 18, 1969, Joplin and her band performed \"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)\" as well as \"[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]\".

However, the album's recording quality and engineering, as well as the musicianship (including three performances by former [[Bob Dylan]]/[[Paul Butterfield]]/[[Electric Flag]] guitarist [[Mike Bloomfield]]), were considered superior to her previous releases, and some music critics argued that the band was working in a much more constructive way to support Joplin's sensational vocal talents.\n{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Joplin wanted a horn section similar to that featured by the [[Chicago (band)|Chicago Transit Authority]]; her voice had the dynamic qualities and range not to be overpowered by the brighter horn sound.{{citation needed |date=January 2013}}\n\nSome music critics, however, including [[Ralph J.

Joplin informed her band that they would be performing at the concert as if it were just another gig. On Saturday afternoon, when she and the band were flown by helicopter with the pregnant [[Joan Baez]] and Baez's mother from a nearby motel to the festival site and Joplin saw the enormous crowd, she instantly became extremely nervous and giddy. Upon landing and getting off the helicopter, Joplin was approached by reporters asking her questions. She referred them to her friend and sometime lover Peggy Caserta as she was too excited to speak. Initially, Joplin was eager to get on the stage and perform but was repeatedly delayed as bands were contractually obliged to perform ahead of Joplin. Faced with a ten-hour wait after arriving at the backstage area, Joplin spent some of that time shooting heroin and drinking alcohol<ref name=\"amburn\" /><ref name=\"caserta\" /> with Caserta in a tent.  The director's cut of the Woodstock movie shows Joplin and Jefferson Airplane singer [[Grace Slick]] standing together near amplifiers watching the band Canned Heat's performance, which started at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Saturday,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.woodstockstory.com/cannedheat.html |title=RS on Canned Heat's Woodstock performance |access-date=February 1, 2021 |archive-date=January 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117222617/https://www.woodstockstory.com/cannedheat.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and Caserta does not appear within camera range. When Joplin finally reached the stage at approximately 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Sunday, she was \"[[wikt:three sheets to the wind|three sheets to the wind]]\", according to biographer Alice Echols.<ref name=\"scars\" /> During her performance, Joplin's voice became slightly hoarse and wheezy, and she struggled to dance.\n\nJoplin pulled through, however, and engaged frequently with the crowd, asking them if they had everything they needed and if they were staying stoned. The audience cheered for an encore, to which Joplin replied and sang \"Ball and Chain\". [[Pete Townshend]], who performed with [[the Who]] later in the same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said the following in his 2012 memoir: \"She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn't at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she'd consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Townshend |first=Pete |title=Who I am: a memoir |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2012 |pages=179}}</ref>\n\nJanis remained at Woodstock for the remainder of the festival. Starting at approximately 3:00&nbsp;a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] during their performance, which was the first time anyone at Woodstock ever had heard the group perform.<ref name=\"Crosby 1988 161\u2013162\">{{cite book |last=Crosby |first=David |title=Long Time Gone |publisher=Doubleday|year=1988 |pages=161\u2013162}}</ref> This information was published by [[David Crosby]] in 1988.<ref name=\"Crosby 1988 161\u2013162\" /> Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in [[Joe Cocker]]'s van and witnessed [[list of performances and events at Woodstock Festival#Sunday, August 17 to Monday, August 18|Hendrix's close-of-show performance]], according to Baez's memoir ''And a Voice to Sing With'' (1989).<ref>{{cite book |last=Baez |first=Joan |title=And a Voice to Sing With |publisher=Summit Books |year=1989 |pages=163\u2013166}}</ref>\n\nStill photographs in color show Joplin backstage with Grace Slick the day after Joplin's performance, wherein Joplin appears to be very happy. She was ultimately unhappy with her performance, however, and blamed Caserta. Her singing was not included (by her own insistence) in the 1970 documentary film or the soundtrack for ''[[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More]]'', although the 25th anniversary director's cut of ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' includes her performance of \"[[Work Me, Lord]]\". The documentary film of the festival that was released in theaters during 1970 includes, on the left side of a [[split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]], 37 seconds of footage of Joplin and Caserta walking toward Joplin's dressing room tent.<ref>{{YouTube|id=kvLno-hy_jE#t=1m44s |title=Footage of Joplin and Caserta begins at 1:44 and ends at 2:21}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Woodstock, Joplin also had problems at [[Madison Square Garden]], in 1969. Biographer Myra Friedman said she had witnessed a duet Joplin sang with [[Tina Turner]] during [[the Rolling Stones]] concert at the Garden on [[Thanksgiving Day]]. Friedman said Joplin was \"so drunk, so stoned, so out of control, that she could have been an institutionalized psychotic rent by mania.\"<ref name=\"buried\" /> During another Garden concert where she had solo billing on December 19, some observers believed Joplin tried to incite the audience to riot.<ref name=\"buried\" /> For part of this concert she was joined onstage by [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Paul Butterfield]].\n\nJoplin told rock journalist David Dalton that Garden audiences watched and listened to \"every note [she sang] with 'Is she gonna make it?' in their eyes.\"<ref name=\"dalton\" /> In her interview with Dalton she added that she felt most comfortable performing at small, cheap venues in San Francisco that were associated with the counterculture.\n\n====1970: January 1970 to October 1970====\nAt the time of the June 1970 interview with Dalton, she had already performed in the Bay Area for what turned out to be the last time. Sam Andrew, the lead guitarist who had left Big Brother with Joplin in December 1968 to form her back-up band, quit in late summer 1969 and returned to Big Brother. At the end of the year, the Kozmic Blues Band broke up. Their final gig with Joplin was the one at Madison Square Garden with Winter and Butterfield.<ref name=\"scars\" /><ref name=\"dalton\">{{Cite book |title=Piece Of My Heart |first=David |last=Dalton |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-306-80446-5}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1970, Joplin traveled to [[Brazil]], where she stopped her drug and alcohol use. She was accompanied on vacation there by her friend Linda Gravenites (wife of songwriter Nick Gravenites), who had designed Janis's stage costumes from 1967 to 1969.\n\nIn Brazil, Joplin was romanced by a fellow American tourist named David (George) Niehaus, who was traveling around the world. A Joplin biography written by her sister Laura said, \"David was an upper-middle-class Cincinnati kid who had studied communications at Notre Dame. ... [and] had joined the Peace Corps after college and worked in a small village in Turkey. ... He tried law school, but when he met Janis he was taking time off.\"<ref name=\"Joplin, Laura\" />\n\nNiehaus and Joplin were photographed by the press at [[Rio Carnival]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name=\"dalton\" /> Gravenites also took color photographs of the two during their Brazilian vacation. According to Joplin biographer Ellis Amburn, in Gravenites' snapshots they \"look like a carefree, happy, healthy young couple having a tremendously good time.\"<ref name=\"amburn\" />\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interviewed Joplin during an international phone call, quoting her: \"I'm going into the jungle with a big bear of a beatnik named David Niehaus. I finally remembered I don't have to be on stage twelve months a year. I've decided to go and dig some other jungles for a couple of weeks.\"<ref name=\"amburn\" /> Amburn added in 1992, \"Janis was trying to kick heroin in Brazil, and one of the nicest things about David was that he wasn't into drugs.\"<ref name=\"amburn\" />\n\nWhen Joplin returned to the U.S., she began using heroin again. Her relationship with Niehaus soon ended because he witnessed her shooting drugs at her new home in [[Larkspur, California]]. The relationship was also complicated by her ongoing romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta, who also was an intravenous addict, and Joplin's refusal to take some time off and travel the world with him.<ref name=\"amburn\" /><ref name=\"Garvin, Glenn\" />\n\nAround this time, she formed her new band, known for a short time as Main Squeeze, then renamed the [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]].<ref name=\"scars\" /><ref name=\"amburn\" /><ref name=\"buried\" /> The band comprised mostly young Canadian musicians previously associated with [[Ronnie Hawkins]] and featured an organ, but no horn section. Joplin took a more active role in putting together the Full Tilt Boogie band than she had with her prior group. She was quoted as saying, \"It's ''my'' band. Finally it's ''my'' band!\"<ref name=\"scars\" /> In May 1970, after performing under the name Main Squeeze at a Hell's Angels event, the renamed Full Tilt Boogie Band began a nationwide tour. Joplin became very happy with her new group, which eventually received mostly positive feedback from both her fans and the critics.<ref name=\"scars\" />\n\nPrior to beginning a summer tour with Full Tilt Boogie, she performed in a reunion with Big Brother at the [[Fillmore West]], in San Francisco, on April 4, 1970. Recordings from this concert were included in an in-concert album released posthumously in 1972. She again appeared with Big Brother on April 12 at [[Winterland]], where she and Big Brother were reported to be in excellent form.<ref name=\"amburn\" /> She performed with the band, billed as Main Squeeze, at a party for the [[Hells Angels]] at a venue in [[San Rafael, California]] on May 21, 1970, according to a web site maintained by Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew.<ref name=\"samandrew\">{{cite web |url=http://samandrew.com/big-brother-history-part-six-1969-to-1972/ |title=Big Brother history, part six, 1969 to 1972 |first=Sam |last=Andrew |date=May 9, 2012 |website=samandrew.com |access-date=April 16, 2020 |archive-date=May 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200517073440/http://samandrew.com/big-brother-history-part-six-1969-to-1972/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Andrew's web site quotes him as saying, \"This will be the first time that Janis' old band and her new band will be at the same venue, so everyone is a little on edge.\"<ref name=\"samandrew\" />\n\nAccording to Joplin's biographer Ellis Amburn, Big Brother with its lead singer Nick Gravenites was the opening act at the party that was attended by 2,300 people.<ref name=\"amburn\" /> The Hells Angels, who had known Joplin since 1966, paid her a fee of 240 dollars to perform.<ref name=\"amburn\" /> Gravenites and Sam Andrew (who had resumed playing guitar with Big Brother) differed in their opinions of her performance and how substance abuse affected it.<ref name=\"amburn\" /> Gravenites described her singing as \"stupendous,\" according to Amburn.<ref name=\"amburn\" /> Amburn quoted Andrew twenty years later: \"She was visibly deteriorating and she looked bloated. She was like a parody of what she was at her best. I put it down to her drinking too much and I felt a tinge of fear for her well-being. Her singing was real flabby, no edge at all.\"<ref name=\"amburn\" />\n\nShortly thereafter, Joplin began wearing multi-colored feather boas in her hair. (She had not worn them at the May 21 Hell's Angels party / concert in San Rafael).<ref name=\"samandrew\" /> By the time she began touring with Full Tilt Boogie, Joplin told people she was drug-free, but her drinking increased.<ref name=\"amburn\" />\n\nFrom June 28 to July 4, 1970, during the Festival Express tour, Joplin and Full Tilt Boogie performed alongside [[Buddy Guy]], [[the Band]], [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Ten Years After]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Delaney & Bonnie]], [[Eric Andersen]], and [[Ian & Sylvia]].<ref name=\"amburn\" /> They played concerts in [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Calgary]].<ref name=\"amburn\" /><ref name=\"dalton\" /> Joplin jammed with the other performers on the train, and her performances on this tour are considered to be among her greatest.\n\nJoplin headlined the festival on all three nights. At the last stop in Calgary, she took to the stage with [[Jerry Garcia]] while her band was tuning up. Film footage shows her telling the audience how great the tour was and shows her and Garcia presenting the organizers with a case of [[tequila]]. She then burst into a two-hour set, starting with \"[[Tell Mama (song)|Tell Mama]]\". Throughout this performance, Joplin engaged in several banters about her love life. In one, she reminisced about living in a San Francisco apartment and competing with a female neighbor in flirting with men on the street. She finished the Calgary concert with long versions of \"Get It While You Can\" and \"Ball and Chain\".\n\nFootage of her performance of \"Tell Mama\" in Calgary became an [[MTV]] video in the early 1980s, and the audio from the same film footage was included on the ''[[Farewell Song]]'' (1982) album. The audio of other ''Festival Express'' performances was included on Joplin's ''In Concert'' (1972) album. Video of the performances was also included on the ''[[Festival Express]]'' DVD.\n\nThese performances of entire songs during the ''Festival Express'' concerts in Toronto and Calgary can be purchased, although other songs remain in vaults and have yet to be released.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}\n\nIn the \"Tell Mama\" video shown on MTV in the 1980s, Joplin wore a psychedelically colored, loose-fitting costume and feathers in her hair. This was her standard stage costume in the spring and summer of 1970. She chose the new costumes after her friend and designer, Linda Gravenites (whom Joplin had praised in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''{{'}}s profile of her in its May 1968 edition), cut ties with Joplin shortly after their return from Brazil, due largely to Joplin's continued use of heroin.<ref name=\"scars\" /><ref name=\"amburn\" />\n\nAmong Joplin's last public appearances were two broadcasts of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. In her June 25, 1970 appearance, she announced that she would attend her ten-year high school class reunion.

This, however, is probable: to become clearly homosexual, to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one's own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a tidiness of personality organization. The ridicule and the humiliation that took place at that most delicate period in [Joplin's] early teens, her own inability to surmount the obstacles to regular growth, devastated her a great deal more than most people comprehended. Janis was not heir to an ego so cohesive as to permit her an identity one way or the other. She was, as [the psychiatric social worker she saw regularly in [[Beaumont, Texas]] in 1965 and 1966] Mr. [Bernard] Giarritano put it [in an interview with Friedman], \"diffused\" -- spewing, splattering, splaying all over, without a center to hold. That had as much to do with her original use of drugs [before she first met Giarritano] as did the critical component of guilt and its multiplicity of sources above and beyond the contribution made by her relationships with women.
