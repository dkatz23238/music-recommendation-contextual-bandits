Foo Fighters was initially formed as a one-man project by former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]]. Following the success of the eponymous debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', Grohl (lead vocals, guitar) recruited a band consisting of [[Nate Mendel]] (bass guitar), [[William Goldsmith]] (drums), and [[Pat Smear]] (guitar). After a succession of lineup changes, including the departures of Goldsmith and Smear, the band formed its core lineup in 1999 consisting of Grohl, Mendel, [[Chris Shiflett]] (guitar), and [[Taylor Hawkins]] (drums). In 2005 Smear returned to the band and in 2017 [[Rami Jaffee]] joined the band performing the keyboards and piano. \n\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''Foo Fighters'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997); most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward but appeared as a guest with the band frequently from 2005; he rejoined in 2010.\n\nSmear and Goldsmith were replaced by [[Franz Stahl]] and Taylor Hawkins; Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. Foo Fighters released their fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. It was followed with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released their sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007. \n\nFor Foo Fighters' seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'' (2011), produced by [[Butch Vig]], Smear returned as a full member. ''[[Sonic Highways]]'' (2014) was released as the soundtrack to [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|the television miniseries]] directed by Grohl. ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'' (2017) was the second Foo Fighters album to reach number one in the United States and their first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist Rami Jaffee as a full member. The band's tenth album, ''[[Medicine at Midnight]]'' (2021), was the last to feature Hawkins, who died in March 2022. \n\nOver the course of their career, Foo Fighters have won 15 [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] five times, making them among the most successful rock acts in Grammy history.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html \"Dave Grohl interview: 'I\u2019m going to fix my leg and then I\u2019m going to come back'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html|date=June 19, 2015}}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015.

With the album not reaching their expectations amid much infighting, Grohl spent some time helping [[Queens of the Stone Age]] complete their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. Once that album was finished and touring had started for both Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely. Grohl reunited with Hawkins, Shiflett, and Mendel to play the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], alternating days with Queens of the Stone Age. Hawkins and Grohl talked about resuming work on ''One by One'' and after a very satisfying performance the following day, they agreed to stay together. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], the following month.<ref name=back/> The original version of ''One by One'', referred to by the band as Million Dollar Demos, has never been released in its entirety although seven tracks were leaked online in 2012 and 2015.<ref name=spin>{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|title=The Good Fight|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 2002|page=72|first=Alex|last=Pappademas|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107022246/http://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|archive-date=January 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe album was released in October 2002 under the title ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.

The tour for the album included a headline performance at the 2002 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].\n\nFor most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004, upon learning that [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] presidential campaign was using \"Times Like These\" at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to [[John Kerry]]'s campaign, saying, \"There's no way of stopping the president playing your songs, so I went out and played it for John Kerry's people instead, where I thought the message would kinda make more sense.\"<ref name=xfm>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|title=X-clusive: Foo Fighters Vs President George W Bush|date=May 11, 2005|publisher=[[XFM]]|access-date=December 21, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828074927/http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|archive-date=August 28, 2012}}</ref> Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets.

While much of the setlist focused on ''In Your Honor'''s acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs, such as Ain't It The Life, Floaty, and See You. The band also performed Marigold, a ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]''-era song that was best known as a [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] B side.\n\nIn November 2006, the band released their first ever live CD, ''[[Skin and Bones (Foo Fighters album)|Skin and Bones]]'', featuring fifteen performances captured over a three-night stint in Los Angeles.\n\n=== ''Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace'' (2007\u20132009) ===\n[[File:Foo Fighters Live 21.jpg|thumb|Foo Fighters performing live in 2007]]\n\nFor the follow-up to ''In Your Honor'', the band recruited ''The Colour and the Shape'' producer Gil Norton.

At the European MTV Music Awards in 2007, Pat Smear confirmed his return to the band.\n\n''Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace'' was nominated for five [[Grammy Awards]] in 2008.

After Foo Fighters had completed this tour in September 2008, they recorded 13 new songs in studio 606, shortly after announcing a hiatus from touring (which would last until January 2011). These sessions likely lasted from late 2008 \u2013 early 2009. While the members of Foo Fighters had initially planned for their new album (composed of songs from this recording session) to have come out in 2009 with almost no touring support, they ultimately decided to shelve most of the songs from these sessions. Three of these songs were later released \u2014 \"Wheels\" and \"Word Forward\" (on their 2009 compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (Foo Fighters album)|Greatest Hits]]''); and a newly recorded version of \"Rope\" (which ended up making the final cut of ''[[Wasting Light]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fooarchive.com/features/kdec10.htm|title=Kerrang's 50 albums you need to hear in 2011|publisher=Fooarchive.com|access-date=April 18, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122153928/http://www.fooarchive.com/features/kdec10.htm|archive-date=January 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Wasting Light'' (2010\u20132012) ===\n[[File:Foo Fighters 2009.jpg|thumb|Foo Fighters in 2009.

Grohl acknowledged that [[Kurt Cobain]] was an influence on his songwriting: \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down.\" Foo Fighters also used the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\" />\n\nWriting and recording songs for their first album by himself, Grohl intended for the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his drumming, assigning various drum parts to strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\"<ref name=\"Alien parking\" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, the members assisted in song arrangements.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as \"his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]\u2014a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|access-date=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archive-date=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe band members meld melodic and heavy elements. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Grohl said in 2005, \"I love being in a rock band, but I don't know if I necessarily wanna be in an alternative rock band from the 1990s for the rest of my life.\" Grohl noted that the band's acoustic tour was an attempt to broaden the group's sound.<ref>Chick, Steve. \"Foo Fighters: 'Touring the UK?
