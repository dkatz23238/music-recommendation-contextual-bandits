After their debut LP was completed in March 1966, Skip Spence quit the band and he was eventually replaced by [[Spencer Dryden]], who played his first show with the Airplane at the Berkeley Folk Festival on July 4, 1966.

Despite the fact that the group had neither performed outside the Bay Area nor appeared on TV, the album garnered considerable attention in the United States and sold well enough to earn a gold record award. RCA Victor initially pressed only 15,000 copies, but it sold more than 10,000 in San Francisco alone, prompting the label to reprint it. For the re-pressing, the company deleted \"Runnin' Round This World\" (which had appeared on early mono pressings), because executives objected to the word \"trip\" in the lyrics. For similar reasons, RCA Victor substituted altered versions for two other tracks: \"Let Me In\", changing the line \"I gotta get in/you know where\" to \"you shut your door/now it ain't fair.\" In the same song, they also switched the lyric \"Don't tell me you want money\" to \"Don't tell me it ain't funny\". \"Run Around\" was also edited, changing the line \"flowers that sway as you lay under me\" to \"flowers that sway as you stay here by me\". The original pressings of the LP featuring \"Runnin' 'Round This World\" and the uncensored versions of \"Let Me In\" and \"Run Around\" are now worth thousands of dollars on the collectors' market.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}\n\nSigne Anderson gave birth to her daughter in May 1966,<ref name=\"SigneAnderson-AllMusic\"/> and in October she announced her departure from the band.

It reportedly took more than 50 takes to achieve a satisfactory rendition. The Great Society decided to split up in late 1966 and played its last show on September 11.

It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/224 224]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/224}}</ref> The name \"Surrealistic Pillow\" was suggested by the album's \"shadow producer,\" [[Jerry Garcia]], when he mentioned that, as a whole, the album sounded \"as surrealistic as a pillow is soft.\" Although RCA would not acknowledge Garcia's considerable contributions to the album with a production credit, he is listed in the album's credits as \"spiritual advisor.\"{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn addition to the group's two best-known tracks, \"[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]\" and \"[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]\", the album featured \"My Best Friend\" by former drummer Skip Spence, Balin's driving blues-rock songs \"Plastic Fantastic Lover\" and \"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\", and the atmospheric Balin-Kantner ballad \"[[Today (Jefferson Airplane song)|Today]]\". A reminder of their earlier folk incarnation was Kaukonen's solo acoustic guitar ''tour de force'', \"[[Embryonic Journey (instrumental)|Embryonic Journey]]\" (his first composition), which referenced contemporary acoustic guitar masters such as [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] and helped to establish the popular genre exemplified by acoustic guitarist [[Leo Kottke]].{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nThe first single from the album, Spence's \"My Best Friend\", failed to chart, but the next two singles rocketed the group to prominence. Both \"Somebody to Love\" and \"White Rabbit\" became major U.S. hits, the former reaching No. 5 and the latter No. 8 on the Billboard singles chart. By late 1967 the Airplane were national and international stars and had become one of the hottest groups in America. Grace Slick biographer Barbara Rowes called the album \"a declaration of independence from the establishment [-] What Airplane originated was a [[romanticism]] for the electronic age. Unlike the highly homogenized harmonies of the [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]], Airplane never strived for a synthesis of its divergent sensibilities. Through [-] each song, there remain strains of the individual styles of the musicians [creating] unusual breadth and original interplay within each structure\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Rowes |title=Grace Slick |page=74 |publisher=Doubleday |date=1980 |isbn=0-385-13390-1}}</ref>\n\nThis phase of the Airplane's career peaked with their famous performance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey International Pop Festival]] in June 1967. Monterey showcased leading bands from several major music \"scenes\" including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and the United Kingdom, and the resulting TV and film coverage gave national (and international) exposure to groups that had previously had only regional fame. Two songs from the Airplane's set were subsequently included in the [[D. A. Pennebaker]] film documentary of the event.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn August 1967, the Airplane performed in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada, at two free outdoor concerts, along with fellow San Francisco Bay Area band The [[Grateful Dead]]. The first concert was held in downtown Montreal at [[Place Ville Marie]], and the second was at the Youth Pavilion of [[Expo 67]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://expo67.ncf.ca/expo_67_youth_pavilion_extra_2.html |title=August 6, 1967: Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead performed at the Youth Pavilion at Expo 67 |website=Expo 67 in Montreal |first=John |last=Whelan |access-date=October 27, 2017 |language=en-US |archive-date=October 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005175024/http://expo67.ncf.ca/expo_67_youth_pavilion_extra_2.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Airplane also benefited greatly from appearances on national network TV shows such as ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on NBC and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on CBS. The Airplane's famous appearance on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' performing \"White Rabbit\" and \"Somebody to Love\" was videotaped in color and augmented by developments in video techniques. It has been frequently re-screened and is notable for its pioneering use of the [[Chroma key]] process to simulate the Airplane's psychedelic light show.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}\n\n===1967\u20131970: Heavier sound and improvisation===\nAfter ''Surrealistic Pillow'', the group's music underwent a significant transformation. Key influences on the group's new direction were the popularity and success of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and the British supergroup [[Cream (band)|Cream]], which prompted the Airplane (like many other groups) to adopt a \"heavier\" sound and to place a greater emphasis on improvisation. The band's third LP, ''[[After Bathing at Baxter's]]'', was released on November 27, 1967, and eventually peaked in the charts at No. 17. Its famous cover, drawn by renowned artist and cartoonist [[Ron Cobb]], depicts a [[Heath Robinson]]-inspired flying machine (constructed around an idealised version of a typical [[Haight-Ashbury]] district house) soaring above the chaos of American commercial culture.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nRecorded over a period of more than four months, with little input from nominal producer [[Al Schmitt]], the new album demonstrated the group's growing engagement with [[psychedelic rock]]. Where the previous LP had consisted entirely of \"standard-length\" pop songs, ''Baxter's'' was dominated by long multi-part suites, while \"A Small Package of Value Will Come To You Shortly\" was a [[musique concr\u00e8te]]-style audio collage.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\n''Baxter's'' also marked the ascendency of Kantner and Slick as the band's chief composers and the concurrent decline in the influence and involvement of founder Marty Balin. The other members, gravitating toward a harder-edged style, openly criticized Balin for his ballad-oriented compositions. Balin was also reportedly becoming increasingly disenchanted with the \"star trips\" and inflated egos generated by the band's runaway commercial success.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn contrast to \"White Rabbit\" and \"Somebody To Love\", \"The Ballad of You and Me and Pooneil\" only peaked at No. 42 and \"Watch Her Ride\" stalled at No. 61. Both singles did reach the Top 40 in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'', however. None of the band's subsequent singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40 and several failed to chart at all. AM Top 40 radio became wary of a group that had scored a hit with a song that contained thinly veiled drug references and whose singles were often deemed too controversial, so Jefferson Airplane never again enjoyed the kind of widespread AM radio support that served as a prerequisite for Top Ten hits.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-252705-bio--Jefferson-Airplane |title=Yahoo!

Bill Laudner was hired as road manager.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn mid-1968, the group was photographed for a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine story on \"The New Rock\", appearing on the cover of the June 28, 1968 edition. They undertook their first major tour of Europe in August\u2013September 1968, playing alongside [[the Doors]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[England]], [[Germany]], and [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Tamarkin|2003}} In a notorious incident at a concert in [[Amsterdam]], while the Airplane was performing \"Plastic Fantastic Lover\", Doors singer [[Jim Morrison]], under the influence of a combination of drugs fans had given him, appeared on stage and began dancing \"like a [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]\". As the group played faster and faster, Morrison spun around wildly until he finally fell senseless on the stage at Marty Balin's feet. Morrison was unable to perform his set with the Doors and was hospitalized while keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] was forced to sing all the vocals.<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=The Doors: Live in Europe 1968 |publisher=A*Vision Entertainment |date=1991}}</ref> It was also during this tour that Slick and Morrison allegedly engaged in a brief sexual relationship, described in ''Somebody To Love?,'' Slick's 1998 autobiography.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nJefferson Airplane's fourth LP, ''[[Crown of Creation]]'' (released in September 1968), was a commercial success, peaking at No. 6 on the album chart and receiving a gold certification. Grace Slick's \"[[Lather (song)|Lather]]\", which opens the album, is said to be about her affair with drummer Spencer Dryden and his 30th birthday.{{sfn|Tamarkin|2003}} \"[[Triad (The Byrds song)|Triad]]\", a [[David Crosby]] composition,<ref name=\"pc41\" /> had been rejected by [[The Byrds]] because they deemed its subject matter (a ''[[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]]'') to be too \"hot.\" Slick's searing sexual and social-commentary anthem \"Greasy Heart\" was released as a single in March 1968. A few tracks recorded for the LP were left off the album but later included as bonus tracks, including the Grace Slick/[[Frank Zappa]] collaboration \"Would You Like A Snack?\"{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nThe Airplane's appearance on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' in the fall of that year caused a minor stir when Grace Slick appeared in [[blackface]] (she claimed she simply wanted to wear all the makeup she saw in her dressing room) and raised her fist in the [[Black Panther Party]]'s salute after singing \"Crown of Creation\".{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn November 1968, the band played \"House at Pooneil Corners\" on a [[New York City]] rooftop. It was filmed for D. A. Pennebaker movie ''1 PM''.

It became the Airplane's fourth Top 20 album, peaking at No. 17.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\n[[Hot Tuna]] began during a break in Jefferson Airplane's touring schedule in early 1969 while Grace Slick recovered from throat node surgery that left her unable to perform. Kaukonen, Casady, Kantner and drummer [[Joey Covington]] played several shows around San Francisco, including the Airplane's original club, The Matrix, before Jefferson Airplane resumed performing. Their early repertoire derived mainly from Airplane material that Kaukonen (the band's frontman) sang and covers of American [[country blues]] artists such as [[Reverend Gary Davis]], [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Bo Carter]] and [[Blind Blake]]. In addition, Casady and Kaukonen played as a duo under the moniker with Kaukonen on acoustic guitar and Casady on electric bass. From October 1969 to November 1970, Hot Tuna (also including Balin and, following Kantner's departure, a dedicated rhythm guitarist in their electric performances until November 1970) performed as the opening act to Jefferson Airplane with a combination of both electric and acoustic sets.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn April 1969, sessions began for their next album, ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'', using new 16-track facilities at the [[Wally Heider]] Studio in San Francisco. This proved to be the last album by the \"classic\" lineup of the group. The album's release was delayed when the band ran into conflict with their label over the content of songs such as \"We Can Be Together\" and the planned title of the album, ''Volunteers of Amerika''. \"Volunteers of Amerika\" is a corruption of the [[Volunteers of America]] charity, the term being in vogue in 1969 as an ironic expression of dissatisfaction with America; after the charity objected, the name was shortened to ''Volunteers''.{{sfn|Tamarkin|2003|p=197}}\n\nA few days after the band headlined at a free concert in New York's [[Central Park]] in August 1969, they performed in what Grace Slick characterized as the \"morning maniac music\" slot at the [[Woodstock Festival]], for which the group was joined by noted British session keyboard player [[Nicky Hopkins]]. When interviewed about Woodstock by Jeff Tamarkin in 1992, Paul Kantner still recalled it with fondness, whereas Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden had less than rosy memories.<ref>\n{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/music-in-wales/2009/11/18/paul-kantner-talks-woodstock-jefferson-starship-and-smashed-cars-91466-25195547/|title=Paul Kantner talks Woodstock, Jefferson Starship and smashed cars|author=Allen, Gavin|date=November 18, 2009|work=South Wales Echo|access-date=December 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013000143/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/music-in-wales/2009/11/18/paul-kantner-talks-woodstock-jefferson-starship-and-smashed-cars-91466-25195547/|archive-date=October 13, 2012|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nImmediately after their Woodstock performance, the band appeared on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' and played a few songs.

The album continued the Airplane's run of Top 20 LPs, peaking at No. 13 and attaining a RIAA gold certification early in 1970. It was their most political venture, showcasing the group's vocal opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and documenting their reaction to the changing political atmosphere in the United States. The best-known tracks include \"[[Volunteers (song)|Volunteers]],\" \"We Can Be Together,\" \"[[Good Shepherd (song)|Good Shepherd]],\" and the [[Post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-apocalyptic]] \"[[Wooden Ships]],\" which Paul Kantner co-wrote with [[David Crosby]] and [[Stephen Stills]], and which [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] also recorded on their debut album.<ref name=\"JA_Top_Ten_Songs\">{{cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jefferson-airplane-songs/ |first=Michael |last=Gallucci |date=January 28, 2016 |title=Top 10 Jefferson Airplane Songs |work=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |access-date=May 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210517091927/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jefferson-airplane-songs/ |archive-date=May 17, 2021 |url-status=live |language=en-US |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nRCA raised objections to the phrase \"up against the wall, motherfucker\" in the lyrics of Kantner's \"We Can Be Together\", but the group managed to prevent it from being censored on the album, pointing out that RCA had already allowed the offending word to be included on the cast album of the rock musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. In addition, the song had the line \"in order to survive, we steal, cheat, lie, forge, fuck, hide, and deal\", which was also kept on the album (and which they sang on broadcast TV during their Dick Cavett appearance). For the single versions of \"We Can Be Together,\" \"motherfucker\" was changed to a long, drawn out \"Ma,\" and \"fuck\" was changed to \"fred.\" These edits were reflected in the printed lyrics that accompanied the album.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn September 1969, Kaukonen and Casady played a week of acoustic-based concerts at the New Orleans House in [[Berkeley, California]], as Hot Tuna; recordings culled from this engagement were released as the band's [[Hot Tuna (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1970. This initial Hot Tuna album was remarkably successful, reaching No. 30 on the U.S. album chart. Over the next two years, the various configurations of Hot Tuna began to occupy more and more of Casady's and Kaukonen's time, contributing to the growing divisions within Jefferson Airplane that came to a head in 1972.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn December 1969, the Airplane played at the [[Altamont Free Concert]] at [[Altamont Speedway]] in California.

It looked more like sepia-toned [[Hieronymus Bosch]].\" He took time off before returning to music the following year as [[Mickey Hart]]'s replacement in the [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]]. Dryden was replaced by Hot Tuna drummer Joey Covington, who had already contributed additional percussion to ''Volunteers'' and performed select engagements with the Airplane as a touring second drummer in 1969. Later that year, the band was further augmented by the addition of veteran jazz violinist [[Papa John Creach]], a friend of Covington who officially joined Hot Tuna and Jefferson Airplane for their fall tour in October 1970.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\n[[File:JeffersonAirplaneKralingen1970.jpg|thumb|Jefferson Airplane at [[Holland Pop Festival|Kralingen]] 1970]]\nTouring continued throughout 1970, but the group's only new recordings that year were the single \"[[Mexico (Jefferson Airplane song)|Mexico]]\" backed with the [[B-side]] \"Have You Seen the Saucers?\" Slick's \"Mexico\" was an attack on President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Operation Intercept]], which had been implemented to curtail the flow of marijuana into the United States. \"Have You Seen the Saucers\" marked the beginning of the [[science fiction]] themes that Kantner explored in much of his subsequent work, including ''[[Blows Against the Empire]],'' his first solo album. Released in November 1970 and credited to \"Paul Kantner/[[Jefferson Starship]],\" this prototypical iteration of Jefferson Starship (alternatively known as the [[Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra]]) included David Crosby and [[Graham Nash]]; Grateful Dead members Jerry Garcia, [[Bill Kreutzmann]], and Mickey Hart; session luminary [[Harvey Brooks (bassist)|Harvey Brooks]]; David Freiberg; and Slick, Covington and Casady.

Although he had remained a key part of live performances after the band's creative direction shifted from the brooding love songs that he specialized in, the evolution of the polarized Kantner/Slick and Kaukonen/Casady cliques\u2014compounded by an emerging drinking problem\u2014had finally left him the odd man out. Following the traumatic death of Janis Joplin, he began to pursue a healthier lifestyle; Balin's study of [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] and abstention from drugs and alcohol further distanced him from the other members of the group, whose drug intake continued unabated. This further complicated the recording of their long-overdue follow-up to ''Volunteers''; Balin had recently completed several new songs, including \"Emergency\" and the elongated R&B-infused \"You Wear Your Dresses Too Short,\" both of which later appeared on archival releases.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nOn May 13, 1971, Grace Slick was injured in a near-fatal automobile crash when her car slammed into a wall in a tunnel near the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in San Francisco. The accident happened while she was drag racing with Jorma Kaukonen; both were driving at over 100 miles per hour, and Kaukonen claims that he \"saved her life\" by pulling her from the car.{{sfn|Tamarkin|2003|p=239\u2013240}} Slick's recuperation took a few months, forcing the Airplane to curtail their touring commitments. In the meantime, Slick recorded a comic song (\"Never Argue with a German If You're Tired or European Song\") about the incident for the new album.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn September 1971, ''[[Bark (Jefferson Airplane album)|Bark]]'' was released. With cover art depicting a dead fish wrapped in an [[A&P]]-style grocery bag, it was both the final album owed to RCA under the band's existing contract and the inaugural release on the band's Grunt Records vanity label. Manager Bill Thompson had struck a deal with RCA to allow Jefferson Airplane to run Grunt Records as they saw fit while retaining RCA's distribution. The single \"Pretty As You Feel\", excerpted from a longer jam with members of [[Santana (band)|Santana]] and featuring lead vocals by Joey Covington, its principal composer, was the last Jefferson Airplane chart hit, peaking at No. 60 in ''Billboard'' and No. 35 in ''Cashbox''. The album rose to No. 11 in ''Billboard'', higher than ''Volunteers'', ''Blows Against the Empire'' and Hot Tuna's second album, ''[[First Pull Up, Then Pull Down]]'', released three months before ''Bark'' in June.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn spite of the band's continued success, major creative and personal divisions persisted between the Slick/Kantner and Kaukonen/Casady factions. (Kaukonen's \"Third Week In The Chelsea,\" from ''Bark'', chronicles the thoughts he was having about leaving the band.) These problems continued to be exacerbated by the band's escalating [[cocaine]] use and Slick's [[alcohol use disorder]]. Consequently, while the band played several dates in August in support of ''Bark'' (including two concerts in the [[New York metropolitan area]] and a show apiece in [[Detroit]] and [[Philadelphia]]), no tour was planned. Following a private concert/party commemorating the formation of Grunt Records at San Francisco's Friends and Relations Hall in September, the band would not reconvene until several Midwestern engagements in January 1972.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nJefferson Airplane held together long enough to record one more album, entitled ''[[Long John Silver (album)|Long John Silver]],'' begun in April 1972 and released in July. By this time the various members were thoroughly engaged with their various solo projects. Following the release of Kantner and Slick's ''[[Sunfighter]]'' in November 1971 and Creach's [[Papa John Creach (album)|eponymous solo debut]] in December 1971, Hot Tuna released their first studio album and third opus (''[[Burgers (album)|Burgers]]'') in February 1972; meanwhile, Joey Covington immersed himself in various Grunt Records projects, including his own solo album (''Fat Fandango'', released in 1973) and the sessions for Black Kangaroo's debut album (led by multi-instrumentalist [[Peter Kaukonen]], Jorma's younger brother). However, Covington was either dismissed from the band or left of his own volition shortly after the sessions commenced.{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nWith Hot Tuna drummer Sammy Piazza deputizing on one track, Covington (who had already recorded two drum parts) was soon replaced by former [[The Turtles|Turtles]]/[[CSNY]] drummer [[John Barbata]], who ultimately played on most of the album. ''Long John Silver'' is notable for its cover, which folded out into a humidor, which the inner photo depicted as storing cigars (which may have been filled with marijuana). Despite middling reviews, the album rose to No. 20 in the United States, a significantly higher placement than ''Burgers'' (No. 68) or ''Sunfighter'' (No. 89).{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nThe band began a proper national tour to promote ''Long John Silver'' in 1972, their first in nearly two years. Shortly before the tour commenced, David Freiberg (who had recently completed a prison sentence for marijuana possession after leaving Quicksilver Messenger Service) joined as a belated replacement for Balin. The East Coast leg of the tour included a major free concert in Central Park that drew over 50,000 attendees. They returned to the West Coast in September, playing concerts in San Diego, [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]. The tour culminated in two shows at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco (September 21\u201322), both of which were recorded. At the end of the second show, the group was joined on stage by Marty Balin, who sang lead vocals on \"Volunteers\" and the final song, \"You Wear Your Dresses Too Short\".{{fact|date=September 2022}}\n\nThe Winterland shows were the last live performances by Jefferson Airplane<sup>[[Jefferson Airplane#cite note-22|[22]]]</sup> until their reunion in 1989. A new live album, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Winterland]]'', was culled from the tour and released in April 1973. Later that year, Kaukonen and Casady decided to focus on Hot Tuna as a full-time endeavor, effectively leaving the band; however, no official announcement was ever released.
