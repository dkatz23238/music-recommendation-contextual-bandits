Later,{{efn |name=dac |Exact dates aren't given in ''Demons and Cocktails''.}} Jones invited Paul Rosser and Chris Davies to play on bass guitar and keyboards, respectively.<ref name=\"Marks 23\">Marks (2009), p. 23</ref> Cable recalls he was the one who suggested that Jones be the singer, as his dad was a singer back in the sixties who supported [[Roy Orbison]].<ref name=\"Marks 23\"/> In 1986 the band recorded a demo under the name \"Zephyr\". When Jones went on holiday the band played a gig without him, which resulted in Jones leaving the band and Jones and Cable going their separate ways.<ref name=\"Marks 24\"/> Jones, Rosser and Davies formed their own R&B band called \"Silent Runner\" while Cable joined a glam-rock band named \"King Catwalk\" on drums.<ref>Marks (2009), pp. 24\u201325</ref>\n\nA few years later,{{efn |name=dac}} Cable got sacked from the band and after a few weeks after that when on a bus, he waved to Jones who was standing at a bus stop and waved back.<ref>Marks (2009), pp. 25\u201326</ref> It was the first contact they had since Zephyr had broken up. Two weeks later, Jones and Cable started speaking again in the Ivy Bush.<ref name=\"Marks 26\">Marks (2009), p. 26</ref> They agreed to give the band another go but Cable only wanted to play their own songs, to which Jones agreed.<ref name=\"Marks 26\"/> The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.<ref name=\"Marks 27\">Marks (2009), p. 27</ref>\n\nEverett went on holiday for two weeks but Jones and Cable wanted to continue rehearsing, so Jones invited long-time friend [[Richard Jones (Stereophonics)|Richard Jones]] to fill in for Everett.<ref name=\"Marks 27\"/> Stunned by Richard's appearance and bass playing, Cable convinced Kelly to keep him instead of Everett.<ref name=\"Marks 27\"/> The band decided they needed another member to play lead guitar. Simon Collier was the first guitarist brought in, but didn't stay in the band; he did, however, become Kelly's guitar technician.<ref>Marks (2009), p. 32</ref> The band tried hiring two other guitarists, another Richard Jones and Glenn Hyde.<ref name=\"Marks 33\">Marks (2009), p. 33</ref> Neither stayed for long.

On 12 June 1998, Stereophonics played to over 10,000 spectators in the grounds of [[Cardiff Castle]] in Wales. Footage of the concert was released on VHS and DVD, titled ''[[Live at Cardiff Castle]]''.\n\n=== Mainstream success (2001\u20132004) ===\nThe band released their third album, ''[[Just Enough Education to Perform]]'', in April 2001. The album included the track \"[[Mr. Writer]]\", which includes lyrics that criticise a critic who the band believe gave them a negative review. The album also contained one of the band's most famous tracks, \"[[Have a Nice Day (Stereophonics song)|Have a Nice Day]]\", which reached number five in the UK charts. To promote the new album, ''Just Enough Education to Perform'', the Stereophonics played a two-day festival, which was called ''A Day at the Races''. This event was held in [[Donington Park]] on the first day and at Cardiff's [[Millennium Stadium]] on the second. The concerts were supported by [[Ash (band)|Ash]], [[Black Crowes]] and [[the Crocketts]], with [[Proud Mary]] playing Donington only. Over 200,000 separate tickets were sold for the weekend festival. The performance was released on a DVD in 2002.\n\n2003 saw the release of their fourth album, titled ''[[You Gotta Go There to Come Back]]''. The album contained one of the band's most popular songs, [[Maybe Tomorrow (Stereophonics song)|Maybe Tomorrow]]. In September 2003, drummer [[Stuart Cable]] was sacked. According to reports, it was because of his lack of commitment to the band. Cable, at the time, presented a TV show called \"Cable TV\" and felt that the band would never improve. Because of this, he missed several rehearsals and live concerts. He was eventually replaced by [[Javier Weyler]].<ref name=\"BBCStuartSacking\">''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3138970.stm Stereophonics drummer fired] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110816053511/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3138970.stm |date=16 August 2011 }}.''

The show was closed with a live version of \"[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]\", originally recorded by Slade. The group took a break after their 2003\u20132004 world tour, which included a set at the Manchester Move Festival in July 2004.\n\n=== Drummer change and Stuart Cable's death (2005\u20132010) ===\n[[File:Stereophonics hamburg 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Stereophonics performing in Hamburg, 13 September 2007]]\nTheir fifth studio album, ''[[Language.

The band achieved their first number one hit in the UK singles charts with the album's first single, \"[[Dakota (song)|Dakota]]\". The second single from the album was \"Superman\". However, that song did not repeat the success of \"Dakota\", peaking at number thirteen. After \"Superman\" came \"Devil\", featuring a controversial video and reaching number eleven in the charts. The album was nominated for a [[The Pop Factory|Pop Factory award]] at the end of the year, losing out to [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]]'s ''[[Pushing the Senses]]''.\n\nOn 2 July 2005, the group appeared at the [[Live 8]] concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, playing to their biggest audience yet. The band were also scheduled to support [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] for a number of dates across Europe, in early 2006, but pulled out due to family commitments. 2006 also saw the release of Stereophonics' first live album, ''[[Live from Dakota]]''. The album is a two-disc compilation, featuring twenty tracks spanning all five of the band's albums and capturing the best of their 2005 world tour. Rather than being a recording of a single show, the tour was recorded every night and the band picked out the best version of each song individually. The album also features a track titled \"Jayne\", later released as part of Kelly Jones' solo album, ''[[Only the Names Have Been Changed]]''.\n\n''[[Pull the Pin]]'' was released in the UK on 15 October 2007, along with a download-only taster; \"[[Bank Holiday Monday (song)|Bank Holiday Monday]]\".

Zindani continued to tour with the band for the remainder of the ''Pull the Pin'' tour, playing lead guitar and backing vocals.

The DVD is a double disc with a runtime of nearly four hours. Much of this footage was recorded around the time that the ''You Gotta Go There to Come Back'' album was being recorded. This is because a similar band history DVD was listed for release shortly after that album but was never released, due to the departure of Stuart Cable. This explains Jones' hairstyle (circa 2003/2004) in the interview footage and the appearance of Stuart and the rest of the band freely talking about their togetherness and solidarity as the original three members. The original footage was updated by adding further footage to the end, bringing it up to date with the band's fifth album. Stuart does not appear on any of the extra footage. Availability coincides with the US re-release of the ''Language.Sex.Violence.Other?'' DVD, and the worldwide digital debut of their latest studio album, ''[[Pull the Pin]]''.\n\nIn 2007, Jones released a solo album, titled ''[[Only the Names Have Been Changed]]'', while recording the band's sixth studio album, ''Pull the Pin''. The album contains ten tracks (all named after women) and features minimal instrumentation. The album also includes the song \"Jayne\", a previously unreleased Stereophonics track featured on the live album ''[[Live from Dakota]]'' and the ''Rewind'' DVD.\n\nStereophonics also performed the original opening theme tune for the TV series ''[[Long Way Round]]''. The song's lyrics were slightly altered for the follow-up series, ''[[Long Way Down]] and [[Long Way Up]]''.\n\n==Personnel==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Current members'''\n*[[Kelly Jones]] \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, keyboards, piano <small>(1992\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Richard Jones (Stereophonics)|Richard Jones]] \u2013 bass guitar, harmonica, backing vocals <small>(1992\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Adam Zindani]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2007\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Jamie Morrison]] \u2013 drums, percussion <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n\n'''Current touring musicians'''\n*Tony Kirkham \u2013 keyboards, piano, harmonica, acoustic guitar, backing vocals <small>(1999\u2013present)</small>\n*Gavin Fitzjohn - saxophone, guitar <small>(2018\u2013present)</small>\n\n{{col-2}}\n'''Former members'''\n*[[Stuart Cable]] \u2013 drums, percussion <small>(1992\u20132003; died 2010)</small>\n*[[Javier Weyler]] \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals <small>(2004\u20132012)</small>\n\n'''Former touring musicians'''\n*Scott James \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2001\u20132004)</small>\n*Aileen McLaughlin \u2013 backing vocals <small>(2002\u20132003)</small>\n*Anna Ross \u2013 backing vocals <small>(2002\u20132003)</small>\n*[[Steve Gorman]] \u2013 drums, percussion <small>(2003\u20132004)</small>\n*Sam Yapp \u2013 drums, percussion <small>(2012)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:22\nPlotArea = left:80 bottom:60 top:0 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1992 till:01/08/2022\nLegend     = position:bottom orientation:vertical columns:2\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMajor = increment:5 start:1992\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1993\n\nColors =\n id:vocals   value:red     legend:Lead_vocals,_keyboards,_piano\n id:bvocals  value:pink    legend:Backing_vocals\n id:guitar   value:green   legend:Guitar\n id:bass     value:blue    legend:Bass,_harmonica\n id:drums    value:orange  legend:Drums,_percussion\n id:lines    value:black   legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n color:black layer:back\n at:25/08/1997\n at:08/03/1999\n at:11/04/2001\n at:02/06/2003\n at:14/03/2005\n at:12/10/2007\n at:16/11/2009\n at:04/03/2013\n at:11/09/2015\n at:27/10/2017\n at:25/10/2019\n at:04/03/2022\n\nBarData =\n bar:KJ text:\"Kelly Jones\"\n bar:AZ text:\"Adam Zindani\"\n bar:RJ text:\"Richard Jones\"\n bar:SC text:\"Stuart Cable\"\n bar:JW text:\"Javier Weyler\"\n bar:JM text:\"Jamie Morrison\"\n\nPlotData=\n width:11\n bar:KJ from:01/01/1992 till:end        color:guitar width:3\n bar:KJ from:01/01/1992 till:end        color:vocals \n bar:RJ from:01/01/1992 till:end        color:bass\n bar:RJ from:01/01/1992 till:end        color:bvocals width:3\n bar:SC from:01/01/1992 till:25/09/2003 color:drums\n bar:JW from:01/01/2004 till:19/07/2012 color:drums\n bar:JW from:01/01/2004 till:19/07/2012 color:bvocals width:3\n bar:AZ from:20/05/2007 till:end        color:guitar\n bar:AZ from:20/05/2007 till:end        color:bvocals width:3\n bar:JM from:24/09/2012 till:end        color:drums\n}}\n\n== Discography ==\n{{Main|Stereophonics discography|List of songs recorded by Stereophonics}}\n<!--Only for main studio albums-->\n*''[[Word Gets Around]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Performance and Cocktails]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Just Enough Education to Perform]]'' (2001)\n*''[[You Gotta Go There to Come Back]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Language.
