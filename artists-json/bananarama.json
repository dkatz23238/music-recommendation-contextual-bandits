She was replaced by [[Jacquie O'Sullivan]]. This line-up had UK top-five hits with \"I Want You Back\", (1988) and a cover of The Beatles' \"Help!\" (1989) recorded with comedy duo [[French and Saunders]] and comedian [[Kathy Burke]] for the charity Comic Relief. They also charted with \"[[Love, Truth and Honesty]]\" and \"[[Nathan Jones (song)|Nathan Jones]]\". \nIn 1989, they embarked on their first world tour and had another hit with a new remixed version of \"Cruel Summer\". \nIn 1990 and 1991, they had top-30 hits with \"[[Only Your Love]]\", \"[[Preacher Man]]\" and \"[[Long Train Runnin'#Bananarama version|Long Train Running]]\" and new studio album ''[[Pop Life (Bananarama album)|Pop Life]]'', which featured these singles and a fourth, \"[[Tripping on Your Love]]\", which was released soon after the album. \nAfter O'Sullivan's late-1991 departure, Dallin and Woodward continued Bananarama as a duo, with further top-30 hits including \"[[Movin' On (Bananarama song)|Movin' On]]\" (1992), \"[[More, More, More]]\" (1993), \"[[Move in My Direction]]\" (2005) and \"[[Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)]] (2005)\". \nFahey rejoined Bananarama in 2017 and they toured the UK and North America between November that year and August 2018.\n\n==Career==\n===1980\u20131982: Early years===\nBananarama formed in September 1980 when teenagers and childhood friends Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward moved from [[Bristol]] to London and met Siobhan Fahey. Dallin and Fahey were studying journalism at the [[London College of Fashion]] (University of Arts) and Woodward was working at the [[BBC]] in Portland Place. Dallin and Woodward were living at the YWCA and were about to be made homeless until [[Paul Cook]], with whom they had become friends after meeting at a club, offered them a place to live above the former [[Sex Pistols]] rehearsal room in Denmark Street, [[Charing Cross]]. They took their name, in part, from the [[Roxy Music]] song \"[[Pyjamarama (song)|Pyjamarama]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bananarama.co.uk/biography/|title=Bananarama: Biography|date=2017|periodical=Bananarama.co.uk|access-date=12 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904012833/http://www.bananarama.co.uk/biography/|archive-date=4 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe trio were ardent followers of the [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]] music scenes during the late 1970s and early 1980s. They often performed impromptu sets or backing vocals at gigs for such bands as [[The Monochrome Set]], [[The Professionals (band)|The Professionals]], [[Subway Sect]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Department S (band)|Department S]], [[The Nips|The Nipple Erectors]] and [[The Jam]].<ref>[http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/nippleerectorsshanneinterview.htm \"The Shanne Bradley Interview 26/8/2001\"] punk77.co.uk Retrieved 18 September 2018.</ref><ref>[http://www.bananarama.co.uk/oltpr/ \"The Original Line Up Tour\"] bananarama.co.uk Retrieved 18 September 2018.</ref> In 1981, Bananarama recorded their first demo, \"[[Aie a Mwana]]\", a cover of a song by [[Black Blood (band)|Black Blood]], sung in Swahili. The demo was heard at [[Demon Records]], who consequently offered Bananarama their first deal. The song was an underground hit (UK #92) and Bananarama were signed by Decca (later [[London Records]]) and remained on the label until 1993. UK music magazine ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' featured an article on Bananarama after the release of their first single. This caught the attention of ex-[[The Specials|Specials]] member [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]], who invited them to collaborate with his new vocal group [[Fun Boy Three]] on their album and the single \"[['Tain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)|It Ain't What You Do (It's The Way That You Do It)]]\". In 1982, the song hit the Top 5 in the UK and gave Bananarama their first significant mainstream success. Fun Boy Three then guested on Bananarama's single, \"[[He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'|Really Saying Something]]\", later that year.\n\n===1982\u20131985: ''Deep Sea Skiving'' and ''Bananarama''===\nBananarama experienced their greatest success during the period 1982 to 1989, with their first three albums primarily produced and co-written with [[Jolley & Swain]]. Their debut album, ''[[Deep Sea Skiving]]'' (UK #7, US #63) (1983) contained several hit singles&nbsp;\u2013 \"[[He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'|Really Saying Something]]\" (UK #5) and \"[[Shy Boy]]\" (UK #4)&nbsp;\u2013 and included a [[cover version]] of \"[[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye]]\" (UK #5). \"[[Cheers Then]]\" (#45) was released as the third single, with little chart success, but very positive reviews from critics. The band recorded a version of the Sex Pistols' song \"No Feelings\" in late 1982 for the soundtrack of the British teen-comedy film, ''[[Party Party (film)|Party Party]]''.\n\nDuring 1982 and 1983, Bananarama did several promotional US press tours and TV appearances on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]''. Success in the United States came in 1984 with a Top Ten hit \"[[Cruel Summer (Bananarama song)|Cruel Summer]]\".\n\nTheir second album, ''[[Bananarama (album)|Bananarama]]'' (UK #16, US #30) (1984) was a more socially conscious effort. The group wanted to be taken more seriously, so they wrote songs that focused on heavier topics. \"[[Hot Line to Heaven|Hot Line To Heaven]]\" (UK #58) is a stand against the drugs-are-cool culture. Meanwhile, \"[[Rough Justice (Bananarama song)|Rough Justice]]\" (UK #23) was written about Thomas \"Kidso\" Reilly, the band's road manager and brother of Fahey's boyfriend [[Jim Reilly]] (drummer of the Northern Irish punk band [[Stiff Little Fingers]]), who was shot and killed by a British soldier in Belfast in August 1983.<ref name=\"Reilly\">{{Cite web|title=Stiff Little Fingers Jim Reilly on forgiving soldier who killed brother: When you're 18 years old, you're still a child yourself|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/stiff-little-fingers-jim-reilly-on-forgiving-soldier-who-killed-brother-when-youre-18-years-old-youre-still-a-child-yourself-36828209.html|website=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=21 April 2018|access-date=11 August 2022}}</ref> The album also contained the hit singles, \"[[Robert De Niro's Waiting...]],\" (UK #3) and their first US Top 10 hit, \"Cruel Summer\" (UK #8, US #9) (1983), which was included in the film ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]].'' The trio also recorded the single, \"[[The Wild Life (Bananarama song)|The Wild Life]]\" (US #70) for a [[The Wild Life (film)|1984 American film of the same name]].\n\nIn 1984, Bananarama featured on the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] single, \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]],\" and were the only artists to appear on both the original 1984 Band Aid and the 1989 Band Aid II versions (Fahey appeared on the 1984 version while O'Sullivan appeared on the 1989 version).\n\n1985 was a quiet transitional year for Bananarama. The single \"[[Do Not Disturb (Bananarama song)|Do Not Disturb]]\" (UK #31), which would appear on their next album, maintained their public profile.\n\n===1986\u20131987: ''True Confessions'' and international success===\n1986 saw the release of their third Jolley/Swain album, ''[[True Confessions (album)|True Confessions]]''. Later editions contained other tracks and extra production duties by [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]], [[Matt Aitken]] and [[Pete Waterman]] known as [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] (SAW). The move resulted in the international number one hit, \"[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]]\", (a remake of [[Shocking Blue]]'s song from 1969, which had been a number 1 hit in 1970). The dance-oriented production typified the SAW approach to pop music. Bananarama had tracked the producers down after hearing \"[[You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)]]\" by [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The song won a Juno Award in Canada for International Single of The Year. Also in 1986, Dallin and Woodward were featured as backing vocalists on two songs on ''Family Album,'' produced by [[John Lydon]].\n\n{{Listen|filename=bananarama venus.ogg|title=\"Venus\" \u2013 Bananarama|description=An excerpt from Bananarama's 1986 version of \"Venus\"}}\nThe [[music video]] for \"Venus\" received heavy airplay on [[MTV]] in the United States. It featured the group in various costumes including a [[devil]], a French temptress, a [[vampire]], and Greek goddesses. The video marked a pivotal shift towards a more glamorous and sexy image, which contrasted with their tomboyish appearances in their earlier work.\n\nFollow-up singles \"[[More Than Physical]]\" (UK #41) and \"[[A Trick of the Night]]\" (UK #32) were less successful, which unfortunately had less promotion. Woodward was pregnant with her son Thomas at the time and was unable to tour or physically promote the album or its subsequent singles.\n\n\"More Than Physical\" marked the beginning of Bananarama's songwriting relationship with Stock Aitken Waterman. It was a collaborative process that Stock has described as troubled, despite producing a string of hits.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title=A Journey Through Stock Aitken Waterman: Ep 13: I Can Prove It to More Than Physical on Apple Podcasts|url=https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/ep-13-i-can-prove-it-to-more-than-physical/id1565879477?i=1000537391918|access-date=2021-10-07|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en-AU}}</ref>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be creative if someone\u2019s just going to mock you, or laugh at you,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Bananarama it was just awkward, all the time very awkward, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable writing with them.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring a press tour in [[New York City]], the group also recorded a song \"Riskin' a Romance\" featured in the film ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'' (1987). The track was notable because it featured Fahey taking lead vocals, and [[Daryl Hall]] was the producer. During this trip, the group also re-recorded the vocals for their next UK release \"More Than Physical\" and \"A Trick of the Night\" with Mike Stock in Miami.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=A Journey Through Stock Aitken Waterman: Ep 11: Venus on Apple Podcasts|url=https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/ep-11-venus/id1565879477?i=1000534373869|access-date=2021-09-07|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=A Journey Through Stock Aitken Waterman: Ep 19: Looking Good Diving to I Just Can't Wait on Apple Podcasts|url=https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/ep-19-looking-good-diving-to-i-just-cant-wait/id1565879477?i=1000546134676|access-date=2021-12-27|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en-AU}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1987, Bananarama participated in the recording of the single \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\" (UK #1) as members of the charity supergroup [[Ferry Aid]]. All sales from the single were donated to charity in response to the capsizing of the ferry [[Herald of Free Enterprise disaster|MS ''Herald of Free Enterprise'']], which killed 193 people. Among the featured singers was Woodward, who sang with [[Nick Kamen]].\n\n===1987\u20131988: ''Wow!'' and Fahey's departure===\nIn the wake of the success of \"Venus,\" Bananarama began work on the album ''[[Wow! (Bananarama album)|Wow!]]'' The group's sound shifted towards dance-oriented Europop. ''Wow!'' was released on 4 September 1987 by London Records. It topped the Australian ARIA album charts for one week in June 1988.\n\n\"[[I Heard a Rumour]]\" (UK #14, US #4) was their strongest performing international hit from this album. The track bears notable similarities in part to Michael Fortunati's \"[[Give Me Up]]\", which was released in early 1986. However, producer [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]] denied the track was based excessively on that record, insisting \"I Heard A Rumor\" was simply broadly inspired by [[Europop]] trends at the time.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |title=A Journey Through Stock Aitken Waterman: Ep 24: Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now to F.L.M. on Apple Podcasts |url=https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/ep-24-nothings-gonna-stop-me-now-to-f-l-m/id1565879477?i=1000551681202 |access-date=2022-04-30 |website=Apple Podcasts |language=en-AU}}</ref> \"We didn't do sampling...

Stewart|Dave Stewart]]&nbsp;\u2013 left the group. Her last performance as a member of the group was \"Love in the First Degree\" at the Brit Awards in February 1988.

Also in 1989, the band embarked upon their first world tour, which included shows in North America, East Asia, and the UK.\n\nBananarama's 1991 album, ''[[Pop Life (Bananarama album)|Pop Life]]'', saw Dallin and Woodward's songwriting collaboration with their friend Youth. They worked with a variety of producers including [[Martin Glover|Youth]], [[Shep Pettibone]], and [[Steve Jolley]] of Jolley & Swain. They also incorporated a wider range of musical genres including [[reggae]], [[flamenco]] guitar, and [[acid house]]. Singles \"[[Only Your Love]]\" (UK #27), \"[[Preacher Man]]\" (UK #20), a cover of the [[Doobie Brothers]]' \"[[Long Train Running]]\" (UK #30), and \"[[Tripping on Your Love]]\" (UK #76) were the group's final releases with O'Sullivan.

Other singles from the album were \"Last Thing on My Mind\" (UK #71) and a cover of the 1976 [[Andrea True Connection]] song \"More, More, More\" (UK #24). This album was Bananarama's last one on [[London Records]].\n\nTheir next offering was 1995's ''[[Ultra Violet (Bananarama album)|Ultra Violet]]'' (entitled ''I Found Love'' in Japan) on a new label. The album and its three singles \u2014 \"I Found Love\", \"[[Every Shade of Blue]]\", and \"[[Take Me to Your Heart (Bananarama song)|Take Me to Your Heart]]\" \u2014 were only released in some European countries, North America, Japan, and Australia, but not in Britain.\n\nIn 1998, Dallin and Woodward asked Fahey to join them to record the track \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" (a cover of the classic [[ABBA]] song) for the [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] celebration ''A Song for [[Eurotrash (TV show)|Eurotrash]]'' on [[Channel 4]]. However, Fahey made it clear that this was a one-off and that she was not formally rejoining the group. In 1999, Dallin, Woodward, and Fahey were interviewed together for an episode of the BBC music documentary series ''Young Guns Go For It'' dedicated to the group. Jacquie O'Sullivan also took part in the programme.\n\nIn 2001, Dallin and Woodward, who had been frequently working in France, had recorded the album ''[[Exotica (Bananarama album)|Exotica]]'' with the French label M6. The album also included a cover of [[George Michael]]'s \"Careless Whisper\", Latin- and R&B-influenced dance songs, and reinterpreted versions of their earlier hits.\n\n===2002\u20132006: ''Drama''===\nBy 2002, Bananarama had sold 40 million records worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} That year, they released another greatest hits album, ''[[The Very Best of Bananarama]]'', in the UK.

With Siobhan Fahey returning as a special guest for a performance of \"Venus\", the group celebrated the 20th anniversary of their first hit with a gig at [[G-A-Y]] at the [[London Astoria]], in front of an audience of 3,000 people. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nWith 1980s retro in vogue, Bananarama made a comeback in the British dance charts in 2005. Solasso remixed their early hit \"Really Saying Something.\" A video was filmed with models from ''[[Britain's Next Top Model]]'' TV show.\n\nIn 2005, Dallin and Woodward collaborated with Swedish hit makers Murlyn, writing and recording in Sweden for 6 months to produce the album 'Drama'. The first single \"Move in My Direction\" reached #14. The second single \"Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)\" entered and peaked at #26 on the UK charts. In the US on the Billboard Dance Chart, \"Look on the Floor\" peaked at #2 and \"Move in My Direction\" reached #14 in July 2006.\n\n===2006\u20132011: Remasters and ''Viva''===\n\nSummer 2006 saw the [[Warner Bros.
