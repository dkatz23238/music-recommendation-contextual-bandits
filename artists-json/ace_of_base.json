In the last decade, they have released a number of demo tracks, first via their Facebook page, then in 2015 on the compilation album ''[[Hidden Gems (Ace of Base album)|Hidden Gems]]''. An expanded two-disc edition was included in the 2020 boxset ''[[All That She Wants: The Classic Collection]]''. Jenny Berggren continues to perform the group's hits in solo concerts around the world.\n\n==History==\n\n===1987\u20131992: Formation===\nIn 1987, following a number of years as part of a [[new romantic]] and [[punk music|punk]] [[cover band]] called G Konrad (named after [[Gy\u00f6rgy Konr\u00e1d|a Hungarian author]]), Jonas Berggren formed a band with two friends, Johnny Lind\u00e9n and Niklas Tr\u00e4nk, for a school project; his sisters Linn and Jenny later joined as singers. The new band went through several names: [[New Arbat Avenue|Kalinin Prospect]] after an avenue in Moscow; CAD (Computer-Aided Disco); and Tech-Noir, French for ''black technology,'' after a nightclub in the film ''[[The Terminator]]''.<ref name=\"Kristina\">{{Cite book|title = \"In Sweden we have something called an 'ankdamm'\" - En intervju med Ace of Base motor och l\u00e5tskrivare, Jonas Berggren|isbn = 9789174236859|last1 = Adolfsson|first1 = Kristina|date = 1995}}</ref> They toured the clubs of Sweden with self-written material, [[techno music|techno]] inspired by 1980s Italodisco and house music.\n\nJohnny left the group in 1989, and Niklas made his departure known by failing to turn up to a gig at B\u00e4ltesp\u00e4nnarparken in Gothenburg on August 4, 1990, instead attending a [[Rolling Stones]] concert on the other side of town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.happynation.net/aobgbg.htm |title=Ace of Base GBG |publisher=[[Happy Nation]] |access-date=October 18, 2010 |archive-date=September 1, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901001855/http://www.happynation.net/aobgbg.htm |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> Jonas asked his friend Ulf Ekberg to stand in for Niklas. In an interview with ''[[N\u00f6jesguiden]]'', Jonas explained: \"He shared a rehearsal room with us and we asked if he wanted to be with us on stage because he was really energetic. He thought it sounded fun and then we started writing. Ulf is very good at technology and I am more good at melodies, so it was a very good combination.\" Inspired by a Jamaican reggae band who resided in a studio next door to theirs, they experimented with a fusion of reggae and pop \u2013 dubbed \"China reggae\" by their Jamaican friends \u2013 which would become the band's trademark sound.<ref name=\"Ulf2016\" />\n\nAfter responding to an ad in the paper ''[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]'', the new quartet started working in the studio with record producer [[John Ballard (record producer)|John Ballard]],<ref name=\"Ballard\">{{cite web|url=https://shows.acast.com/eurovisionlegends/episodes/john-ballard|title=Eurovision Legends Podcast - John Ballard|date=12 January 2022|publisher=Eurovision Legends}}</ref> and decided to come up with a new name in order to make a fresh start, as well as to avoid confusion with another band with the same name who were attracting bad reviews.<ref name=\"Kristina\" /> Linn said: \"No one could pronounce the name of the group and nobody could remember it.\" They settled on Ace of Base in early 1991, after Ulf was inspired by the [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] song \"[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]\".<ref name=\"Ulf2016\">{{cite web|url=http://euromentravel.com/culture/popculture/ulf-ekberg-ace-of-base-interview|title=Ulf Ekberg (Ace of Base): The Interview|date=7 April 2016|publisher=EuroMenTravel|access-date=11 July 2016}}</ref> In an interview in 2018, Ulf explained: \"The name came out of a hangover I had on New Year's Day. So, I was hungover, watching MTV and I saw Mot\u00f6rhead's video for their song 'Ace of Spades'. I liked the name and I thought I'd play around with those words. We're four members in this band, so I thought, 'Good. Four aces. I'll keep the ace.' Then I thought of our studio and how it's our base.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marcandrew.ca/chitchat/aceofbase/|title = 25 years later Ace of Base revisits the origin of their name}}</ref>\n\nThe group continued performing in the clubs of Gothenburg, but struggled to gain recognition, partly due to the preference of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] over techno in their hometown, according to singer Jenny.<ref>Happy Nation Home Video, VHS, 1997</ref> They also sent out demo cassettes to numerous record companies but \"everybody refused\" to sign them. In May 1991, Jonas and Ulf made a trip to various record companies in Stockholm, including [[Polar Music]], who wanted them to record more songs first, and [[Nordik beat#Swemix|SweMix]], who were interested but didn't have the time to do anything with them until autumn.\n\nIn July, Klas Lunding at Telegram Records arranged for them to record a new version of \"[[Wheel of Fortune (Ace of Base song)|Wheel of Fortune]]\" in their newly renovated Decibel Studio, but didn't offer them a recording contract. Jonas recounts: \"When it had just been finished, [[Martin Dodd]], ''(Head of A&R at independent [[Denmark|Danish]] label Mega Records)'' called and shouted: 'Do not sign anything, do not sign anything!'. They wanted everything from us, while Telegram only wanted the reggae songs and no up-tempos.  We had already recorded a single with Telegram, but hadn't signed anything. Klas is not the fastest in the world, so to speak - and that was perhaps lucky for us. So Mega bought the master tape from Klas for 34,000 SEK.\"<ref name=\"Kristina\" /> Martin Dodd remarked in a 1995 interview: \"When I got the demo in my hand, I knew nothing about the group but I immediately loved the melodies. The melancholy in the songs and their way of writing. At that time, house music was big and this went completely against the flow. It sounded fresh.\"<ref name=\"Kristina\" />\n\n\"Wheel of Fortune\" was serviced to radio and nightclubs in Sweden in early 1992, with it reaching Gothenburg's local Jockeytoppen chart in March, and prompting an invitation to perform on music television channel [[ZTV (Sweden)|ZTV]]. However, the record failed to gain traction in Sweden, so Mega switched focus to Denmark. After servicing the single to media three times, it was finally released commercially at the end of June 1992, entering the Danish singles chart at No. 6, before rising to No. 2.\n\n===1992\u20131994: International success and ''Happy Nation''/''The Sign''===\n{{Main|Happy Nation|The Sign (Ace of Base album)|l2=The Sign}}\n\nFollowing the success of \"Wheel of Fortune\" in Denmark, the group continued working on music. After hearing [[Kayo Shekoni|Kayo]]'s \"Another Mother\" in a record store, a top 20 hit in Sweden in 1990, Jonas and Ulf decided that it was exactly the sound they wanted to create.<ref>Beatlab, SVT documentary, 2001</ref> In early 1992, they sent producer [[Denniz PoP]] a demo tape including a song called \"Mr. Ace\". At first he wasn't particularly impressed, but the tape got stuck in the cassette player in his car. This resulted in him having to listen to it repeatedly and gradually he realized the song's potential. He'd lost the band's contact details but when they called him a few months later, he invited them to his SweMix studio to re-record the song in July 1992.<ref name=\"mrpop\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2015/10/denniz_pop_max_martin_and_cheiron_studios_the_man_who_invented_modern_pop.2.html|title=Mr. Pop|last=Seabrook|first=John|date=14 October 2015|magazine=Slate|access-date=15 October 2015}}</ref> The song became \"[[All That She Wants]]\", and upon its release at the end of August, it quickly climbed to No. 1 on the Danish chart, while the previous single was still sitting at No. 2. Keen to rush out an [[LP album|LP]] for the Christmas market, [[Edel-Mega Records|Mega Records]] pressed the band for an album, which was quickly recorded and mixed within a few weeks.\n\nThe album, ''[[Happy Nation]]'', was released on November 2, 1992 in [[Denmark]] and its success prompted interest elsewhere in Europe. A pan-European licence was signed with [[PolyGram|Metronome/PolyGram]] (now [[Universal Music]]), but they were turned down by the American division. Within a few months, \"All That She Wants\" had reached No. 3 in Sweden and had spent eight weeks at No. 1 in Germany. In various European countries, \"[[Happy Nation (song)|Happy Nation]]\" and \"[[Waiting for Magic]]\" were released as further singles following the release of the album.\n\nIn May 1993, \"All That She Wants\" consolidated on its European success by topping the chart for three weeks in the United Kingdom. However, despite [[Edel-Mega Records|Mega Records]]'s efforts to secure a distribution deal in the United States, the response was always the same: \"This band will never work in the States.\" Eventually, [[Clive Davis]], founder of [[Arista Records]], heard the song playing on the radio whilst on vacation on his yacht, and rushed to sign a licence with Mega for the Americas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/good-timing-turned-ace-of-base-s-the-sign-into-the-luck-1823004434|title=Good timing turned Ace Of Base's The Sign into the luckiest hit of the '90s|website=The A.V.

Worried about sales of import copies of ''Happy Nation'', however, Davis opted to tweak the track list of the original LP by adding three new tracks, and re-titling it ''[[The Sign (Ace of Base album)|The Sign]]''. Released in the USA on November 23, 1993, it remained in the top three of the ''Billboard'' Top 200 for 26 consecutive weeks, and was nominated for ''Best Pop Album'' at the 1995 [[Grammy Awards]]. The refreshed album was released in Europe as ''[[Happy Nation (US Version)]]''.  Collectively, the different versions of the album reached the No. 1 position in at least 14 countries, and sold over 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling debut albums of all time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ws-vAwAAQBAJ&q=ace+of+base+happy+nation+21+million+copies&pg=PA736|title = Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volume 1: Media, Industry, Society|isbn = 9781847144737|last1 = Shepherd|first1 = John|last2 = Horn|first2 = David|last3 = Laing|first3 = Dave|last4 = Oliver|first4 = Paul|last5 = Wicke|first5 = Peter|date = March 6, 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe second U.S. single was the album's title track, \"[[The Sign (Ace of Base song)|The Sign]]\", released on December 14. It was even more successful than the first, spending six weeks at No. 1 and becoming the best-selling single of 1994. It was also a major hit internationally, peaking at No. 2 in the UK and Sweden and at No. 1 in Germany; whilst in Australia it topped the charts for four weeks.\n\nRecorded at the request of Clive Davis, \"[[Don't Turn Around]]\" was the group's next single, which had previously been released by [[Tina Turner]] as the B-side of her single \"[[Typical Male]]\", and had been a UK No. 1 hit for [[Aswad]] in 1988. The cover version hit the top 5 in the US, UK, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.\n\nPromotion for the album concluded with the final single release \"[[Living in Danger]]\", which was yet another top 40 hit internationally and was performed in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] at the first ever [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] in [[Berlin]] in November 1994.\n\nThe band were caught up in controversy when on 27 March 1993, the Swedish [[newspaper]] ''[[Expressen]]'' reported that Ulf had been a member of a [[skinhead]] gang in his teenage years, long prior to his association with Ace of Base. The band and Ulf himself have addressed these claims numerous times. Linn remarked in 1993: \"Ulf gave all that up long ago and my family had nothing to do with any of that in the first place.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-j3beHCDWwoJ:https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-11-20-ca-58879-story.html+&cd=15&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title = Just Don't Mention You-Know-Who : Ace of Base is a Swedish pop vocal group with two men and two women--but don't ask them about ABBA. - Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In 2013, the story was revisited in a report by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', referring to an unauthorized CD released in 1998 called ''Uffe Was a Nazi!'', containing songs with racist content which were claimed to have been recorded by Ulf's former band Commit Suiside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/rm35nr/ace-of-bases-secret-nazi-past|title = Ace of Base's Secret Nazi Past}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[E!#E!

He also remarked: \"I have always been deeply regretful of that period in my life, as I strive to bring happiness to people, and during that period I did not live up to that standard.

To hasten the process, instead of Jonas and Ulf writing most of the album, each member was encouraged to submit their own tracks for consideration.\n\nIn the end, 17 tracks were chosen for the second album, titled ''[[The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|The Bridge]]''. It marked a considerable change of direction in sound; alongside the reggae and dance sounds that had made the group so popular were more experimental tracks and several ballads. The lead single, \"[[Lucky Love]]\", however, was a mainstream pop record, and was premiered in August 1995 at the [[1995 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships in Athletics]] in Gothenburg. It debuted at No. 1 in Sweden upon release in October, becoming their first chart-topper in their homeland. It was also a top 20 hit across Europe, peaking at No. 1 in Finland, No. 2 in Denmark, No. 13 in Germany and No. 20 in the United Kingdom.\n\nArista Records instead opted for the more up-tempo track \"[[Beautiful Life (Ace of Base song)|Beautiful Life]]\" as the first single in the US, where it peaked at No. 15 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming the first American hit for its co-producer [[Max Martin]], who would go on to become one of the world's most in-demand songwriters and producers. It was released as the second single from the album in most countries, also reaching No. 15 in the UK and charting in at least 17 countries. An alternative acoustic mix of \"Lucky Love\" was chosen as the second U.S. single, peaking at No. 30.\n\n''The Bridge'' was certified platinum in 14 countries, but did not match the sales of the group's first album. \"[[Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry]]\" was released as the third single from the album and achieved moderate success in Europe, but  failed to chart on the Hot 100 in the USA. In February 1996, the band performed at the [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar International Song Festival]] in [[Chile]], topping the bill alongside [[2 Unlimited]].\n\nAfter touring Asia and Australasia in April 1996, the group temporarily retreated from the limelight, scrapping plans to release either \"My D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" or \"Edge Of Heaven\" as a single, and emerging only in 1997 for an April performance at the [[World Music Awards]], and at a July concert celebrating the 20th birthday of [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria of Sweden]].\n\n===1998\u20131999: ''Flowers'' / ''Cruel Summer''===\n{{Main|Flowers (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|l1=Flowers|l2=Cruel Summer}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Ace_Of_Base-Flowers.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Ace_Of_Base-Cruel_Summer.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Linn's image was blurred on the cover art of ''[[Flowers (Ace of Base album)|Flowers]]'' and ''[[Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer]]''.\n}}\nHaving felt rushed to record a second album, the group were given as much time as they need to produce their third, with much of it being recorded in Jonas's own studio, \"The Barn\".

Deciding that \"Life Is a Flower\" was \"too European in nature\", Clive Davis pushed \"Cruel Summer\" as the lead single for the United States, and it brought Ace of Base back into the U.S. Top 10 for the first time in four years, being certified gold. The album was also renamed ''[[Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer]]'' and featured a different track list from the European release. For this version of the album, Davis persuaded a reluctant Linn to record the Billy Steinberg-penned ballad \"[[Everytime It Rains]]\".\n\n\"Life Is a Flower\" was re-recorded as \"[[Whenever You're Near Me]]\" and chosen as the second single from ''Cruel Summer'', peaking at No. 76. \"[[Travel to Romantis]]\" and \"[[Always Have Always Will|Always Have, Always Will]]\" were further singles in Europe whilst \"Everytime It Rains\" was issued as a single in the UK along with a repackaged edition of ''Flowers''.\n\n===1999\u20132000: ''Singles of the 90s'' and ''Greatest Hits''===\nThe group went back into the studio in 1999, writing several tracks together as a quartet for the first time, and recording enough demo tracks for consideration for a fourth studio album.  Ulf from the group later revealed that they had hoped to release a track called \"Pole Position\" as the lead single, with a music video that would have featured the [[Formula One]] champion driver [[Jacques Villeneuve]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4tpkCgONUA |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/g4tpkCgONUA| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=Ace of Base - Pole Position (Commentary) [13 of 16]|accessdate=November 18, 2021|via=www.youtube.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Several of the tracks recorded for the scrapped studio album were eventually released in demo form by Jonas via Facebook in 2011.\n\nIn November 1999, Mega Records released the best-of album ''[[Singles of the 90s]]'', a compilation of 16 hit singles. A new single taken from it, \"[[C'est La Vie (Always 21)]]\", was a modest chart hit in Sweden, Finland, Germany and Switzerland, and topped the charts in Spain. \"[[Hallo Hallo (Ace of Base song)|Hallo Hallo]]\" followed as the second single in parts of Europe, but only found minor success.\n\nArista Records fulfilled the group's four-album contract in the Americas by releasing ''[[Greatest Hits (2000 Ace of Base album)|Greatest Hits]]'' in March 2000. A new dance mix of \"[[Everytime It Rains]]\", previously included on ''[[Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer]]'', was released as a radio single to promote the album. Both the single and album failed to chart in the USA.\n\n===2002\u20132003: ''Da Capo''===\n{{Main|Da Capo (Ace of Base album)|l1=Da Capo}}\n[[File:Skl2003.jpg|thumb|upright|Linn after a performance in 2002]]\nFollowing a long time away from the pop scene, a new single called \"[[Beautiful Morning]]\" was serviced to radio in Europe in July 2002.  Polydor Records reported that it was their fastest-added track to radio playlists of the year, and it went on peak at No. 38 in Germany and No. 14 in Sweden upon its commercial release in September.\n\nAfter several delays, Ace of Base finally released their fourth studio album, ''[[Da Capo (Ace of Base album)|Da Capo]]'', on September 30, 2002, in Europe, and in Japan through [[Toshiba EMI]] with a different cover and three bonus tracks.  The album received only a soft release in the United Kingdom and was not released in the Americas.  The title comes from the musical term ''da capo'', which translates as \"back to the beginning\", chosen as the sound of the album was seen as a return to the group's early blend of reggae and europop.\n\nAlthough the album charted across much of Europe, it was not as successful as previous releases. Only Jenny and Ulf went on a promotional tour of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, Poland and Austria. Jonas chose to forego promotional activities because \"it was better to be two then\" and led to \"less questions\" about Linn's lack of participation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yes!

The song was a re-written version of a track originally submitted for the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[GoldenEye]]'' in 1995.  However, Clive Davis persuaded the band that it was not the best move for the band at the time so they withdrew it from consideration.  In Scandinavia, [[Edel-Mega]] released  \"[[Unspeakable (song)|Unspeakable]]\" as the second single, but its poor chart performance ended the promotion of the album prematurely.\n\n===2003\u20132006: Hiatus===\nThe group remained out of the spotlight throughout 2003 and 2004. During this time, Jenny performed solo live performances in several Christian shows with her husband Jakob Petr\u00e9n and released an album as a vocalist with the Swedish group Arose.\n\nIn 2005, a handful of songs featuring vocals by both Jenny and Linn were recorded with producer Tommy Ekman, including \"Would You Believe\" and \"Make My Day\". Jonas and Ulf later explained that the group did not have the energy to finish the project, though the tracks that were recorded eventually surfaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeTmeKNt2E |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/7OeTmeKNt2E| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=Ace of Base - Make My Day (Commentary) [5 of 16]|date=8 March 2015|publisher=YouTube|access-date=9 October 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2005, the group reunited, without Linn, for several live performances at the [[Night of the Proms]] in Belgium, alongside other artists such as [[Donna Summer]].\n\n===2007\u20132009: Reunion===\n[[Image:Aob tour.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Jonas, Jenny, and Ulf performing in [[Saint Petersburg]], 2007.|Jonas, Jenny and Ulf during a concert in [[Saint Petersburg]], 2007.]]\nAce of Base reunited as a trio to perform their first full-length concert since 1996 in [[Yekaterinburg]], Russia, on November 15, 2007.
