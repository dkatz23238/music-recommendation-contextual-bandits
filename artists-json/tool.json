Although many animals use [[Tool use by animals|simple tools]], only [[Human|human beings]], whose use of [[stone tool]]s dates back [[Paleolithic|hundreds of millennia]], have been observed using tools to make other tools. \n\nEarly human tools, made of such materials as [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[bone]], and [[wood]], were used for preparation of [[food]], [[hunting]], manufacture of [[Weapon|weapons]], and working of materials to produce [[clothing]] and useful artifacts. The development of [[metalworking]] made additional types of tools possible. Harnessing energy sources, such as [[Working animal|animal power]], [[wind]], or [[steam]], allowed increasingly complex tools to produce an even larger range of items, with the [[Industrial Revolution]] marking an inflection point in the use of tools. The introduction of widespread [[automation]] in the 19th and 20th centuries allowed tools to operate with minimal human supervision, further increasing the productivity of human labor.\n\n== Definition ==\nWhile a common-sense understanding of the meaning of tool is widespread, several formal definitions have been proposed.\n\nIn 1981, Benjamin Beck published a widely used definition of tool use.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Beck |first=Benjamin B. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5607368 |title=Animal tool behavior : the use and manufacture of tools by animals |date=1980 |publisher=Garland STPM Pub |isbn=0-8240-7168-9 |location=New York |oclc=5607368 |access-date=2022-08-28 |archive-date=2022-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220829130907/https://www.worldcat.org/title/5607368 |url-status=live }}</ref> This has been modified to:{{blockquote|The external employment of an unattached or manipulable attached environmental object to alter more efficiently the form, position, or condition of another object, another organism, or the user itself, when the user holds and directly manipulates the tool during or prior to use and is responsible for the proper and effective orientation of the tool.<ref name=\"Shumaker\">{{cite book |isbn=978-0801898532 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dx7slq__udwC&dq=Animal+Tool+Behaviour%3A+The+Use+and+Manufacture+of+Tools+by+Animals&pg=PT24 |title=Animal Tool Behavior: The Use and Manufacture of Tools by Animals |last1=Shumaker |first1=Robert W. |last2=Walkup |first2=Kristina R. |last3=Beck |first3=Benjamin B. |date=2 May 2011 |access-date=28 August 2022 |archive-date=29 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220829130957/https://books.google.com/books?id=Dx7slq__udwC&dq=Animal+Tool+Behaviour%3A+The+Use+and+Manufacture+of+Tools+by+Animals&pg=PT24 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}Other, briefer definitions have been proposed:{{blockquote|An object carried or maintained for future use.|Finn, Tregenza, and Norman, 2009.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Finn |first1=Julian K. |last2=Tregenza |first2=Tom |last3=Norman |first3=Mark D. |year=2009 |title=Defensive tool use in a coconut-carrying octopus |journal=Curr.

There was also the need for precision in making parts.  Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts, and standardization of threaded fasteners. The demand for metal parts led to the development of several [[Machine tool|machine tools]]. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms. Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws, and chisels.

Ideally, the edge of the tool needs to be [[Hardness|harder]] than the material being cut or the blade will become dulled with repeated use. But even resilient tools will require periodic [[sharpening]], which is the process of removing deformation wear from the edge. Other examples of cutting tools include [[Chisel#Gouge|gouges]] and [[drill bit]]s.\n* Moving tools move large and tiny items. Many are [[lever]]s which give the user a [[mechanical advantage]]. Examples of force-concentrating tools include the [[hammer]] which moves a nail or the [[Post maul|maul]] which moves a stake. These operate by applying [[compression (physical)|physical compression]] to a surface. In the case of the [[screwdriver]], the force is rotational and called [[torque]]. By contrast, an [[anvil]] concentrates force on an object being hammered by ''preventing'' it from moving away when struck. [[Writing implement]]s deliver a fluid to a surface via compression to activate the ink cartridge. Grabbing and twisting nuts and bolts with [[pliers]], a glove, a [[wrench]], etc. likewise move items by applying torque (rotational force).\n* Tools that enact chemical changes, including temperature and ignition, such as [[lighter]]s and [[blowtorch]]es.\n* Guiding, measuring and perception tools include the [[ruler]], [[glasses]], [[Square (tool)|square]], [[sensor]]s, [[straightedge]], [[theodolite]], [[microscope]], [[Computer monitor|monitor]], [[clock]], [[phone]], [[printer (computing)|printer]]\n* Shaping tools, such as [[Molding (process)|molds]], [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], [[trowel]]s.\n* Fastening tools, such as [[welder]]s, [[soldering iron]]s, [[rivet gun]]s, [[nail gun]]s, or [[glue gun]]s.\n* Information and data manipulation tools, such as [[Computer|computers]], [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], [[spreadsheet]]s\n\nSome tools may be combinations of other tools. An alarm-clock is for example a combination of a measuring tool (the clock) and a perception tool (the alarm). This enables the alarm-clock to be a tool that falls outside of all the categories mentioned above.\n\nThere is some debate on whether to consider protective gear items as tools, because they do not directly help perform work, just protect the worker like ordinary clothing. They do meet the general definition of tools and in many cases are necessary for the completion of the work. [[Personal protective equipment]] includes such items as [[Glove|gloves]], [[safety glasses]], [[earplug|ear defenders]] and [[biohazard]] suits.\n\n== Function ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2022}}\n\n=== Tool substitution ===\nOften, by design or coincidence, a tool may share key functional attributes with one or more other tools. In this case, some tools can substitute for other tools, either as a makeshift solution or as a matter of practical efficiency. \"One tool does it all\" is a motto of some importance for workers who cannot practically carry every specialized tool to the location of every work task, such as a carpenter who does not necessarily work in a shop all day and needs to do jobs in a customer's house. Tool substitution may be divided broadly into two classes: substitution \"by-design\", or \"multi-purpose\", and substitution as makeshift. Substitution \"by-design\" would be tools that are designed specifically to accomplish multiple tasks using only that one tool.\n\nSubstitution is \"makeshift\" when human ingenuity comes into play and a tool is used for an unintended purpose such as using a long screw driver to separate a cars control arm from a ball joint instead of using a tuning fork. In many cases, the designed secondary functions of tools are not widely known. For example, many wood-cutting [[hand saws]] integrate a [[Square (tool)|square]] by incorporating a specially shaped handle that allows 90\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 angles to be marked by aligning the appropriate part of the handle with an edge and scribing along the back edge of the saw. The latter is illustrated by the saying \"All tools can be used as hammers.\" Nearly all tools can be used to function as a hammer, even though very few tools are intentionally designed for it and even fewer work as well as the original.\n\nTools are also often used to substitute for many mechanical apparatuses, especially in older mechanical devices. In many cases a cheap tool could be used to occupy the place of a missing mechanical part. A window roller in a car could easily be replaced with a pair of [[Locking pliers|vise-grips]] or regular [[pliers]]. A transmission shifter or ignition switch would be able to be replaced with a screwdriver. Again, these would be considered tools that are being used for their unintended purposes, substitution as makeshift. Tools such as a [[rotary tool]] would be considered the substitution \"by-design\", or \"multi-purpose\". This class of tools allows the use of one tool that has at least two different capabilities. \"Multi-purpose\" tools are basically multiple tools in one device/tool. Tools such as this are often power tools that come with many different attachments like a rotary tool does, so you could say that a power drill is a \"multi-purpose\" tool because you can do more than just one thing with a power drill.[[File:Bicycle multi-tool.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Bicycle multi-tool]]\n\n===Multi-use tools===\nA [[multi-tool]] is a hand tool that incorporates several tools into a single, portable device; the [[Swiss army knife]] represents one of the earliest examples. Other tools have a primary purpose but also incorporate other functionality \u2013 for example, [[lineman's pliers]] incorporate a gripper and cutter and are often used as a hammer; and some [[hand saw]]s incorporate a [[Square (tool)|square]] in the right-angle between the blade's dull edge and the saw's handle. This would also be the category of \"multi-purpose\" tools, since they are also multiple tools in one (multi-use and multi-purpose can be used interchangeably \u2013 compare [[hand axe]]). These types of tools were specifically made to catch the eye of many different craftsman who traveled to do their work. To these workers these types of tools were revolutionary because they were one tool or one device that could do several different things. With this new revolution of tools, the traveling craftsman would not have to carry so many tools with them to job sites, in that their space would be limited to the vehicle or to the beast of burden they were driving. Multi-use tools solve the problem of having to deal with many different tools.\n\n==Use by other animals==\n{{Main|Tool use by animals}}\n\nTool use by animals is a phenomenon in which an animal uses any kind of tool in order to achieve a goal such as acquiring food and water, [[Personal grooming|grooming]], defense, [[Animal communication|communication]], [[Play (activity)|recreation]] or [[Animal architecture|construction]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |last1=Shumaker |first1=Robert W. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1269071005 |title=Animal tool behavior : the use and manufacture of tools by animals |last2=Kristina R. |first2=Walkup |last3=Beck |first3=Benjamin |last4=Burghardt |first4=Gordon M. |date=2011 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0128-7 |edition=2nd |location=Baltimore |oclc=1269071005 |access-date=2022-08-28 |archive-date=2022-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220829130914/https://www.worldcat.org/title/1269071005 |url-status=live }}</ref> Originally thought to be a skill possessed only by [[Human|humans]], some tool use requires a sophisticated level of cognition.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |last=Waal |first=F.

Chimpanzees have often been the object of study in regard to their usage of tools, most famously by [[Jane Goodall]], since these animals are frequently kept in captivity and are closely related to humans. Wild tool-use in other primates, especially among [[Ape|apes]] and [[monkeys]], is considered relatively common, though its full extent remains poorly documented, as many primates in the wild are mainly only observed distantly or briefly when in their natural environments and living without human influence.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Some novel tool-use by primates may arise in a localized or isolated manner within certain unique [[Animal culture|primate cultures]], being transmitted and practiced among socially connected primates through [[Cultural learning#In non-human animals|cultural learning]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Many famous researchers, such as [[Charles Darwin]] in his book ''[[The Descent of Man]]'', mentioned tool-use in [[Monkey|monkeys]] (such as [[Baboon|baboons]]).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book |last=Choe |first=Jae C. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1088561040 |title=Encyclopedia of animal behavior |date=2019 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-813252-4 |edition=2nd |location=Amsterdam |oclc=1088561040 |access-date=2022-08-28 |archive-date=2022-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220829130912/https://www.worldcat.org/title/1088561040 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAmong other [[mammals]], both wild and captive [[Elephant|elephants]] are known to create tools using their trunks and feet, mainly for swatting flies, scratching, plugging up waterholes that they have dug (to close them up again so the water doesn't evaporate), and reaching food that is out of reach. Many other [[Social animals|social mammals]] particularly have been observed engaging in tool-use. A group of [[Dolphin|dolphins]] in [[Shark Bay]] uses [[Sea sponge|sea sponges]] to protect their beaks while foraging. [[Sea otters]] will use rocks or other hard objects to dislodge food (such as [[abalone]]) and break open [[shellfish]]. Many or most mammals of the order [[Carnivora]] have been observed using tools, often to trap or break open the shells of prey, as well as for scratching.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[Corvid|Corvids]] (such as [[Crow|crows]], [[Raven (bird)|ravens]] and [[Rook (bird)|rooks]]) are well known for their large brains (among [[birds]]) and tool use. [[New Caledonian crow|New Caledonian crows]] are among the only animals that create their own tools. They mainly manufacture probes out of twigs and wood (and sometimes metal wire) to catch or impale [[Larva|larvae]]. Tool use in some birds may be best exemplified in nest intricacy. [[Tailorbird|Tailorbirds]] manufacture 'pouches' to make their nests in. Some birds, such as [[Weaver bird|weaver birds]], build complex nests utilizing a diverse array of objects and materials, many of which are specifically chosen by certain birds for their unique qualities. [[Woodpecker finch|Woodpecker finches]] insert twigs into trees in order to catch or impale larvae. [[Parrots]] may use tools to wedge nuts so that they can crack open the outer shell of nuts without launching away the inner contents. Some birds take advantage of human activity, such as [[Carrion crow|carrion crows]] in Japan, which drop nuts in front of cars to crack them open.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSeveral species of [[fish]] use tools to hunt and crack open shellfish, extract food that is out of reach, or clear an area for nesting. Among cephalopods (and perhaps uniquely or to an extent unobserved among [[invertebrates]]), [[Octopus|octopuses]] are known to utilize tools relatively frequently, such as gathering coconut shells to create a shelter or using rocks to create barriers.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Tool metaphors==\nA telephone is a communication tool that interfaces between two people engaged in conversation at one level.
