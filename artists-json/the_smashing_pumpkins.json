Formed in 1988 by frontman and guitarist [[Billy Corgan]], bassist [[D'arcy Wretzky]], guitarist  [[James Iha]] and drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]], the band has undergone [[List of the Smashing Pumpkins band members|several line-up changes]] since their reunion in 2006, with Corgan being the sole constant member since its inception. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist [[Jeff Schroeder]].\n\nDisavowing the [[punk rock]] roots of many of their contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely-layered sound, containing elements of [[gothic rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[dream pop]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[shoegaze]], and [[electronica]] in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary composer; his musical versatility and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's distinctive albums, which one writer described as \"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\".<ref name=\"Shaw 93\"/> With 30&nbsp;million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s, often cited as an important act in the popularization of [[alternative rock]] music. However, internal conflicts, drug use, and diminishing sales led to a break-up in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, ''[[Zeitgeist (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Zeitgeist]]''. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled ''[[Teargarden by Kaleidyscope]]'', which encompassed stand-alone singles, EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope\u2014''[[Oceania (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Oceania]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Monuments to an Elegy]]'' in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup released the album ''[[Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.]]'' (2018),  ''[[Cyr (album)|Cyr]]'' (2020) and is scheduled to release ''[[Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts]]'' in three increments across 2022 and 2023.\n\n==History==\n===Early years: 1988\u20131991===\n[[file:Billy Corgan in 1992.jpg|thumb|Vocalist [[Billy Corgan]] in 1992]]\nAfter the breakup of his [[gothic rock]] band The Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], to return to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins.<ref name=\"atn\">{{cite web |url=http://www.starla.org/articles/dares.htm |title=Smashing Pumpkin D'Arcy Dares To Be Happy |first=Michael |last=Goldberg |work=[[Addicted to Noise]] |access-date=March 4, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127233048/http://www.starla.org/articles/dares.htm |archive-date=November 27, 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.spin.com/2013/07/billy-dont-be-a-hero-smashing-pumpkins-cover-story/|title=Billy, Don't Be a Hero|first=Jim|last=Greer|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 1993|access-date=August 18, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904025157/http://www.spin.com/2013/07/billy-dont-be-a-hero-smashing-pumpkins-cover-story/|archive-date=September 4, 2015}}</ref> While working there, he met guitarist [[James Iha]].

Miami: Warner Bros.

''Guitar World'', January 1996.</ref> This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan's love of 1970s popular artists and bands such as [[David Bowie]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], and the [[Electric Light Orchestra]],<ref name=\"siamesedream\" /> as well as [[Shoegazing|shoegaze]], a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect.

The group's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for \"Thirty-Three\", with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.<ref>Commentary for \"Thirty-Three\" music video.
