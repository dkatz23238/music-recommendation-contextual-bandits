The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist [[Jacoby Shaddix]], guitarist [[Jerry Horton]], drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther.\n\nAfter two EPs, James left and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two more EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999, subsequently releasing the triple-platinum ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' in 2000, the gold album ''[[Lovehatetragedy]]'' in 2002 and the platinum album ''[[Getting Away with Murder (album)|Getting Away with Murder]]'' in 2004. A year after ''[[The Paramour Sessions]]'', Buckner left in 2007, and was replaced by [[Tony Palermo]]. Papa Roach then made ''[[Metamorphosis (Papa Roach album)|Metamorphosis]]'' (2009), ''[[Time for Annihilation]]'' (2010), ''[[The Connection (Papa Roach album)|The Connection]]'' (2012), ''[[F.E.A.R. (Papa Roach album)|F.E.A.R.]]'' (2015), ''[[Crooked Teeth (album)|Crooked Teeth]]'' (2017) and  ''[[Who Do You Trust? (album)|Who Do You Trust?]]'' (2019). Their eleventh  studio album ''[[Ego Trip (Papa Roach album)|Ego Trip]]'', was released on April 8, 2022.\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1993\u20131995)===\nPapa Roach's formation began in January 1993, when lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]] and drummer Dave Buckner met on the [[Vacaville High School]] football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist [[Jerry Horton]] from nearby [[Vanden High School]], rhythm guitarist Anne Mikolajcik, trombonist Ben Luther and bassist Will James.<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=McLaughlin|url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/how-infest-made-papa-roach-superstars/|title=How Infest Made Papa Roach Superstars|work=Kerrang!|date=April 25, 2019|access-date=April 16, 2022}}</ref> They decided to enter the school's talent show, performing a version of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s song \"[[Fire (The Jimi Hendrix Experience song)|Fire]]\". They ultimately ended up losing the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band, and Anne Mikolajcik left as well. At this point, Papa Roach was practicing every day and touring, playing every gig they could get. Their first tour van was called Moby Dick, where Shaddix was inspired to come up with his first stage name \"Coby Dick\". The band chose the name Papa Roach from the nickname of Shaddix's step-grandfather, Howard William Roatch.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| date       = December 2000\n| title      = No Way Home\n| url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=aPe2ZKjsEBIC&q=roatch&pg=PA126\n| magazine   = Spin Magazine\n}}</ref>\nIn 1994, Papa Roach released their first [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Potatoes for Christmas]]''. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown, as Buckner was spending the year in [[Seattle]] studying art. In 1995, they released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled ''Caca Bonita''. By this time Buckner was back. In 1996, they replaced original bassist Will James with longtime roadie Tobin Esperance, as James' involvement in a church summer camp would limit the band's summer practicing and touring.\n\n===''Old Friends from Young Years'' and record deal (1996\u20131999)===\n{{Main|Old Friends from Young Years}}\nOn February 4, 1997, the band produced their debut studio album, entitled ''[[Old Friends from Young Years]]''. Still touring heavily, they supported bands such as [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Powerman 5000]], [[Hed PE]], [[Snot (band)|Snot]], [[Far (band)|Far]], and [[Static-X]].\n\nIn 1998, they released an EP titled ''[[5 Tracks Deep]]''. It sold more than 1,000 copies in its first month of release. In 1999, they produced another EP, which would end up being their last independent release, titled ''[[Let 'Em Know]]''. Its success caught the attention of [[Warner Music Group]], who as part of a development deal provided a small amount of money for the production of a five-track promo-demo CD.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html \"Interview With Jay Baumgardner\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017122140/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html |date=October 17, 2012 }}, ''[[HitQuarters]]'', April 25, 2005.</ref> The band decided they wanted influential rock producer [[Jay Baumgardner]] on board to produce the record.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Baumgardner said, \"At first I wasn't really convinced it would work out, but then I saw a video of them performing at a club - I saw all these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart - and that's when I realized that they definitely had potential.\"<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. was not impressed with the demo, and elected not to sign them.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The unreleased disc included the songs \"Infest\", \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Broken Home (Papa Roach song)|Broken Home]]\", \"Dead Cell\", and \"[[She Loves Me Not (song)|She Loves Me Not]]\".\n\nSoon after, [[DreamWorks Records]] offered the band a recording contract.\n\n===Mainstream success, ''Infest, Lovehatetragedy'' and ''Getting Away with Murder'' (2000\u20132005)===\n[[file:Papa Roach 2006.jpg|thumb|The band in 2006.

The band came up with the idea of doing an album in a mansion while they were recording ''[[Getting Away with Murder (album)|Getting Away with Murder]]'', Shaddix stated that recording in a manor was becoming popular for the unique sound and feeling it generates (which is reflected on the lyrics). \"[[...To Be Loved]]\" was the first single to be released from the album, and was the official theme song for ''[[WWE Raw]]'' from 2006 to 2009 until it was replaced by \"[[Burn It to the Ground]]\" by [[Nickelback]]. The album continued in an alternative rock-based direction but still contained softer ballads akin to ''Getting Away with Murder''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;16 on the Billboard 200 Charts.\n\nThe band started touring in support of the album in August 2006, with an American tour followed by another in Europe.
