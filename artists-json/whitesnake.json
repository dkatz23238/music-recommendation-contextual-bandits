Therefore, \"are\" should NOT be changed to \"is\". --> an English [[hard rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1978. The group was originally put together as the backing band for singer [[David Coverdale]], who had recently left [[Deep Purple]]. Though the band quickly developed into their own entity, Coverdale is the only constant member throughout their history.\n\nWhitesnake enjoyed much success in the UK, Europe and Japan through their early years. Their albums ''[[Ready an' Willing]]'', ''[[Come an' Get It]]'' and ''[[Saints & Sinners (Whitesnake album)|Saints & Sinners]]'' all reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. By the mid-1980s, however, Coverdale had set his sights on breaking through in North America, where Whitesnake remained largely unknown. With the backing of American label [[Geffen Records]], Whitesnake released their [[Whitesnake (album)|eponymous album]] in 1987, which became their biggest success to date, selling over eight million copies in the US and spawning the hit singles \"[[Here I Go Again]]\" and \"[[Is This Love (Whitesnake song)|Is This Love]]\". Whitesnake also adopted a more contemporary look, akin to the Los Angeles [[glam metal]] scene. After releasing ''[[Slip of the Tongue]]'' in 1989, Coverdale decided to put Whitesnake on hold to take a break from the music industry. Aside from a few short-lived reunions in the 1990s, Whitesnake remained mostly inactive until 2003, when Coverdale put together a new line-up to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary. Since then Whitesnake have released four more studio albums and toured extensively around the world.\n\nWhitesnake's early sound has been characterized by critics as [[blues rock]], but by the mid-1980s the band slowly began moving toward a more commercially accessible hard rock style. Topics such as love and sex are common in Whitesnake's lyrics, which have been criticized for their excessive use of sexual innuendos and double entendres. Whitesnake have been nominated for several awards during their career, including Best British Group at the [[1988 Brit Awards]]. They have also been featured on lists of the greatest hard rock bands of all time by several media outlets,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=62184 |title=Ep. 036 &#124; 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock - Hour 1 &#124; The Greatest &#124; Episode Summary, Highlights, and Recaps |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605050813/http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=62184#moreinfo |url-status=dead |publisher=VH1.com |access-date=24 April 2014 |archive-date=5 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/09/21/top-25-hard-rock-acts-of-all-time-where-does-your-favorite-rank/ |title= Top 25 Hard Rock acts of all time: Where does your favorite rank? |publisher=The Mercury News |first1=Tony |last1=Hicks |first2=Jim |last2=Harrington |date=21 September 2015 |access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref> while their songs and albums have appeared on many \"best of\" lists by outlets, such as [[VH1]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2006/vh180s.htm |title=VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the 80's |website=Rock on the Net |access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"50Greatest\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-hair-metal-albums-of-all-time-162362/tesla-the-great-radio-controversy-1989-165437/ |title= 50 Greatest Hair Metal Albums of All Time |last1=Beaujour |first1=Tom |last2= Bienstock |first2=Richard |last3= Eddy |first3=Chuck |last4=Fischer |first4=Reed |last5=Grow |first5=Kory |last6=Johnston |first6=Maura |last7=Weingarten |first7=Christopher R. |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=31 August 2019 |access-date=11 February 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |date=20 June 2012 |title=Readers' Poll: The Best Hair Metal Songs of All Time |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/readers-poll-the-best-hair-metal-songs-of-all-time-12979/9-whitesnake-here-i-go-again-256356/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation, ''Snakebite'' and ''Trouble'' (1976\u20131978) ===\nIn March 1976, singer [[David Coverdale]] left the English hard rock group [[Deep Purple]].
