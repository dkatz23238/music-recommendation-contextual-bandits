The band consists of cousins [[James Dean Bradfield]] (lead vocals, lead guitar) and [[Sean Moore (musician)|Sean Moore]] (drums, percussion, soundscapes), plus [[Nicky Wire]] (bass guitar, lyrics). They form a key part of the 1990s Welsh [[Cool Cymru]] cultural movement.\n\nFollowing the release of their debut single \"[[Suicide Alley]]\", Manic Street Preachers were joined by [[Richey Edwards]] as co-lyricist and rhythm guitarist, the band became as a quartet. The band's early albums were in a [[Punk rock|punk]] vein, eventually broadening to a greater [[alternative rock]] sound, whilst retaining a [[left-wing politics|leftist]] political outlook.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.richeyedwards.net/28nov08independent.html |title=Final Farewell for a Cult Hero |website=[[The Independent]] |access-date=9 July 2012 |archive-date=25 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825070048/http://articles.richeyedwards.net/28nov08independent.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Their early combination of androgynous [[glam rock|glam]] imagery and lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" gained them a loyal following.<ref name=\"Price\"/>\n\nManic Street Preachers released their debut album, ''[[Generation Terrorists]]'', in February 1992, followed by ''[[Gold Against the Soul|Gold Against The Soul]]'' in 1993 and ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'' in 1994.<ref name=\"AllMusic2\" /> Edwards disappeared in February 1995 and was legally [[presumed dead]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/manic-street-preachers/pages/richey.shtml |title=BBC Wales \u2013 Music \u2013 Manic Street Preachers \u2013 Richey Edwards |website=[[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] |access-date=9 July 2012}}</ref> The band continued as a trio, and achieved commercial success with the albums ''[[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]]'' (1996) and ''[[This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours]]'' (1998).\n\nThe Manics have headlined festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[T in the Park]], [[V Festival]] and [[Reading Festival|Reading]].

The video featured Nicky Wire in [[Cross dressing|drag]] as [[Marilyn Monroe]] and contained visual references to the film ''[[Betty Blue]]'' and to [[Aleister Crowley]].

It was released to mixed reviews but still performed well, reaching number eight in the UK album chart. The album presents a different sound from their debut album, not only in terms of lyrics but in sound, the band privileged long guitar riffs, and the drums themselves feel more present and loud in the final mix of the album. This sound would be abandoned in their next album and as for the nature of the lyrics they also changed, with Edwards and Wire eschewing their political fire for introspective [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]].<ref name=\"Price 1999\">Price (1999).</ref> According to [[AllMusic]], the album \"takes the [[hard rock]] inclinations of ''Generation Terrorists'' to an extreme.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine\"/>\n\nThe band also stated that the choice to work with [[Dave Eringa]] again was important for this album: \"We finished work in November and then just went straight into a demo studio and we came out about four weeks later with the album all finished. We were all happy with all the songs, we knew what they wanted to sound like, so we didn't want to use a mainstream producer because they've got their own sound and vision of what a record should be like. So we just phoned Dave up and said 'Look, come down, let's see how this works out', and everyone loved what we were doing, so we decided to stay with him.\"<ref name=\"Price 1999\"/>\n\nThe band have described ''Gold Against the Soul'' as their least favourite album and the period surrounding the album as being the most unfocused of their career.

Lyrically the themes were different from their previous effort, instead of introspective and autobiographical tracks such as \"4st 7lb\", Wire's predilection for historical and political themes dominates, like the No. 2 hit single \"[[A Design for Life]]\". The song was the first to be written and released by the band following the mysterious disappearance of figurehead [[Richey Edwards]] the previous year and was used as the opening track on ''[[Forever Delayed]]'', the band's greatest hits album released in November 2002.\n\nJames Dean Bradfield later recalled that the lyric had been a fusion of two sets of lyrics-\"Design for Life\" and \"Pure Motive\"-sent to him from Wales by bassist Nicky Wire, while he was living in [[Shepherd's Bush]]. The music was written \"in about ten minutes\" and Bradfield felt a sense of euphoria with the result. The song was credited with having \"rescued the band\" from the despair felt after the disappearance of Edwards, with Wire describing the song as \"a bolt of light from a severely dark place\".<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/4T4UgrW7tLw Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170817205446/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T4UgrW7tLw&feature=youtu.be Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T4UgrW7tLw |title=How Writing 'A Design For Life' Saved Manic Street Preachers \u2013 Interview |publisher=YouTube |access-date=26 April 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The album was shortlisted for the 1996 [[Mercury Prize]] award for best album and won the band two [[Brit Awards]] for Best British Band and Best British Album,<ref name=\"brits.co.uk\"/> as well as yielding the hit singles \"[[Australia (Manic Street Preachers song)|Australia]]\", \"[[Everything Must Go (song)|Everything Must Go]]\" and \"[[Kevin Carter (song)|Kevin Carter]]\".\n\nSubjects tackled on the album include the tragic life of the photographer [[Kevin Carter]], on the track of the same name, [[Willem de Kooning]] and the maltreatment of animals in captivity on \"Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky\" (which is a quote from the film ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'').

The album received a far more positive reception from fans than the ''[[Forever Delayed]]'' greatest hits album, which was heavily criticised for favouring the band's more commercially successful singles. The only recurring criticism of ''Lipstick Traces'' was the exclusion of the fan favourite \"Patrick Bateman\", from the \"[[La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)]]\" single. The band explained that it was excluded mainly because it was almost seven minutes long and simply would not fit on the album.<ref name=\"Manic Street Preachers\"/>\n\nThe band's seventh studio album, ''[[Lifeblood (album)|Lifeblood]]'', was released on 1 November 2004 and reached No.&nbsp;13 on the UK album chart. Critical response to the album was mixed. The album was more introspective and more focused on the past, Wire talked about the ghosts that haunted this record and stated that the record was a retrospective: \"The main themes are death and solitude and ghosts. Being haunted by history and being haunted by your own past. Sleep is beautiful for me. I hate dreaming because it ruins ten hours of bliss. I had a lot of bad dreams when Richey first disappeared.
