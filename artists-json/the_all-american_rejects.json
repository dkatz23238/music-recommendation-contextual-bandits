The demo is now commonly referred to as ''The Blue Disc'' or ''The Blue Album''. The CD consisted of twelve songs, a few of which would be included on the ''Same Girl, New Songs'' demo made in 2001. Jesse Tabish later split from the group and later became a member of the folk band [[Other Lives (band)|Other Lives]]. Ritter and Wheeler put together the ''[[Same Girl, New Songs]]'' EP, which was soon sent to independent [[Doghouse Records]], where an intern saved the disc from the trash, and revealed it to the label owner.
