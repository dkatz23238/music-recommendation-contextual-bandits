The impetus was two classified advertisements in the weekly paper ''The Recycler''. One had been placed by Hoffs, and the only person to respond was Annette Zilinskas, and the other was by Lynn Elkind, the Petersons' housemate and a departing member of their then band Those Girls. When Hoffs called in response to Elkind's ad, Vicki Peterson answered the phone, and in their conversation, they discovered a great deal of common interests; when Hoffs spoke to Elkind after Peterson gave her the message, they did not have the same common interests and Hoffs then formed a new band with the Petersons. The Those Girls bass guitarist, Vicki Peterson's lifelong best friend Amanda Hills, had also left the band (now a history professor, Amanda Hills Podany has performed as a guest with the Bangles on a few rare occasions)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jan-02-tm-bangles01-story.html|title=Rock Like a Historian|date=January 2, 2005|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re-GfMvJmLY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/Re-GfMvJmLY| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|title=The Bangles \u2013 He's Got a Secret \u2013 Whisky December 8, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockintheoc.com/2018/07/02/the-bangles-at-arroyo-seco-weekend/|title=The Bangles at Arroyo Seco Weekend|website=Rockintheoc.com}}</ref> and this left an opening for Zilinskas.

The band's second album, ''[[Different Light]]'' (January 1986), was more polished than its predecessor, and with the help of the worldwide number-one hit \"[[Walk Like an Egyptian]]\" (written by [[Liam Sternberg]]), put the band firmly in the mainstream, reaching number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The song was sent to them in midsession and the group was divided about whether it would be a failure or a success. When the song was released, the group was amazed to discover that it brought them a new audience of female fans, most of them very young.
