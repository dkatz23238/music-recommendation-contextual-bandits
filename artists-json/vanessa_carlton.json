Upon completion of her education at the [[School of American Ballet]], Carlton chose to pursue singing instead, performing in New York City bars and clubs while attending college. Three months after recording a demo with producer [[Peter Zizzo]], she signed with [[A&M Records]]. \n\nHer debut single, \"[[A Thousand Miles]]\", reached the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2002. Her debut album, ''[[Be Not Nobody]]'', followed and received a [[music recording sales certification|platinum certification]] in the United States. Her subsequent albums, ''[[Harmonium (Vanessa Carlton album)|Harmonium]]'' (2004) and ''[[Heroes & Thieves]]'' (2007), failed to match the commercial success of the first. She produced a fourth album, ''[[Rabbits on the Run]]'' (2011), independently before seeking a record label to release it. Carlton released a Christmas [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Hear the Bells'' in November 2012, and released her fifth studio album, ''[[Liberman (album)|Liberman]]'', on October 23, 2015.<ref name=\"noisetrade5-7-2015\">{{cite web|title=Vanessa Carlton: Young Heart EP|url=http://noisetrade.com/vanessacarlton/young-heart-ep| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/http://noisetrade.com/vanessacarlton/young-heart-ep| archive-date=2021-10-22|publisher=NoiseTrade|access-date=May 7, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=\"twitter2-28-2014\">{{cite web|last=Carlton|first=Vanessa|title=Twitter / Vanessa Carlton: Started in England, finished in Nashville...|url=https://twitter.com/VanessaCarlton/status/439315769122652160| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/https://twitter.com/VanessaCarlton/status/439315769122652160| archive-date=2021-10-22|publisher=Twitter|date=February 28, 2014|access-date=March 3, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=\"cbsnews6-11-2014\">{{cite web|last=Moraski |first=Lauren |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vanessa-carlton-on-her-dreamy-new-album/| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vanessa-carlton-on-her-dreamy-new-album/| archive-date=2021-10-22 |title=Vanessa Carlton on her dreamy new album \u2013 CBS News |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=June 11, 2014 |access-date=June 12, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Childhood and youth===\nCarlton was born on August 16, 1980, in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], the first of three children of Edmund \"Ed\" Carlton, a pilot, and Heidi Lee, a pianist and school music teacher.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://people.com/archive/key-whiz-vol-58-no-3/| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/https://people.com/archive/key-whiz-vol-58-no-3/| archive-date=2021-10-22|title=Key Whiz|date=July 15, 2002|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] | volume = 58 | number = 3}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=E Jones |first=Ellen |date=2019-05-28 |title=Why is A Thousand Miles the most referenced song in cinema? |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/28/why-is-vanessa-carlton-a-thousand-miles-the-most-referenced-song-in-cinema |access-date=2022-04-09 |website=[[The Guardian]] |language=en}}</ref> Her two younger siblings are a sister, Gwen, and a brother, Edmund.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lamb |first=Christopher |url=http://www.teenmusic.com/2002/04/29/vanessa-carlton-a-thousand-miles-to-here |title=Vanessa Carlton: A Thousand Miles To Here |publisher=TeenMusic.com |date=April 29, 2002 |access-date=February 14, 2013 |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831203950/http://www.teenmusic.com/2002/04/29/vanessa-carlton-a-thousand-miles-to-here |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=November 30, 2007 |title=Singer-Songwriter Vanessa Carlton Indeed Loves Ruby's in the Afternoon |url=https://www.grubstreet.com/2007/11/singersongwriter_vanessa_carlt_1.html |access-date=2022-04-30 |website=[[New York (magazine)#Grub Street|Grub Street]] |language=en-us}}</ref> Carlton\u2019s mother comes from a Jewish family in [[Queens, New York]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tang |first=Estelle |date=2017-02-17 |title=16 Years Later, Vanessa Carlton Is Finally 'Fine' With \"A Thousand Miles\" |url=https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a43139/vanessa-carlton-a-thousand-miles/ |access-date=2022-04-30 |website=ELLE |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nHer interest in music began at an early age.
