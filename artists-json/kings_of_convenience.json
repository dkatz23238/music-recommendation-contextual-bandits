Their first musical collaboration was a comedic rap about a teacher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/mb/mb050518kings_of_convenience |title=Art by Ron English, 2012 Live at KCRW on Morning Becomes Eclectic 05.18.05 |publisher=Kcrw.com |access-date=10 April 2012}}</ref> At sixteen, they played together in the band [[Skog]] (\"forest\") with two other friends, releasing one [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Tom Tids Tale]]'', before breaking up and later forming the Kings duo.\n\nThe duo was signed to the American label [[Kindercore Records|Kindercore]] after appearing in European festivals during the summer of 1999. After a spell living in London in 2001, they released their debut album ''[[Quiet Is the New Loud]]''. The album was produced by [[Coldplay]] producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. The album was very successful and even lent its name to a small movement of musicians in the pop underground (including [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic]] contemporaries such as [[Turin Brakes]]) which took [[Elliott Smith]], [[Belle & Sebastian]] and [[Simon & Garfunkel]] as their inspiration and focused on more subtle melodies and messages. Kings of Convenience also inspired an indian music duo [[Parekh & Singh]].<ref>{{cite web |title=WATCH: Parekh & Singh's Vibrant Music Video For \"Ghost\" |url=https://kxt.org/2018/02/watch-parekh-singhs-vibrant-music-video-for-ghost/ |website=KXT 91.7 {{!}} Independent Music Radio for North Texas |date=9 February 2018 |access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Review: Parekh & Singh \u2013 Science City |url=https://www.classicpopmag.com/2019/08/review-parekh-singh-science-city/ |website=Classic Pop Magazine - |date=6 August 2019 |access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[Versus (Kings of Convenience album)|Versus]]'', an album of remixes of tracks from ''Quiet Is the New Loud'', came out shortly after. After this breakthrough year, not much was heard from the band. \u00d8ye spent the next few years living in Berlin and doing solo material, releasing music under the ''[[DJ Kicks]]'' series as well as a solo album titled ''[[Unrest (Erlend \u00d8ye album)|Unrest]]''. He also had a side project named [[The Whitest Boy Alive]].\n\n[[File:Kings of Convenience in Bangkok.jpg|right|thumb|Kings of Convenience performing in Bangkok in 2010]]\n\nIt was not until 2004 that the Kings' follow-up ''[[Riot on an Empty Street]]'' was released. The video made for \"I'd Rather Dance With You,\" the second single from the album, topped [[MTV]]'s European list as the best music video of 2004. The album also featured contributions by [[Feist (singer)|Feist]].\n\nIn January 2008 the band played concerts in the Northern Norwegian cities of [[Troms\u00f8]], [[Svolv\u00e6r]] and [[Bod\u00f8]], and Swedish city [[Ume\u00e5]] along with a concert in August in [[Stockholm]]. The band then toured [[North America]], [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]], including stops in Boston, New York, Toronto, Detroit; Latin American stops in [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]], where they performed in [[Santiago]] with local musician [[Javiera Mena]], who later opened for them in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]].<ref>[http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2009/12/15/389548/cantautor-noruego-erlend-ye-vuelve-a-chile-para-actuar-con-javiera-mena.html {{in lang|es}} Cantautor noruego Erlend \u00d8ye vuelve a Chile para actuar con Javiera Mena] El Mercurio online, 15 December 2009, retrieved 31 January 2014</ref> European stops include [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Spain]]. On some of their American tour stops they appeared with the band Franklin for Short who joined them on stage for a few rousing numbers.\n\nTheir third album, called ''[[Declaration of Dependence]]'', was released on 20 October 2009.\n\nIn June 2012, the band performed at the [[Primavera Sound]] festivals in both Barcelona and Porto.\n\nIn 2017, Eirik released an album entitled 'Analog Dance Music' with his new band Kommode.\n\nIn March 2019, Kings of Convenience provided an update regarding their upcoming (fourth) album, stating that \"the songs were written and even performed live, but when we tried to record it during 2016/2017 for a mixture of reasons the results just weren\u2019t good enough[, and] by that time I (Erlend) didn\u2019t have anymore energy to pour into it[, ... so] 2018 was a charging battery year, and now we are planning to try again\".<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.facebook.com/kingsofconvenience/posts/10157204589738594  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/17936343593/10157204589738594 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |url-access=limited|title=A lot of people are wondering about the new Kings of Convenience album\n|publisher=Facebook\n|date=3 March 2019\n|access-date=12 November 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 April 2021, Kings of Convenience released a new song, \"Rocky Trail\", after 12 years without publishing music as the duo.
