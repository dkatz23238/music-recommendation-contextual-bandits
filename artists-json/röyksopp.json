The duo consists of [[Svein Berge]] and [[Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland]]. \n\nBerge and Brundtland were introduced to each other through a mutual friend in Troms\u00f8, Norway.

The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the [[Troms\u00f8 techno scene]] before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed R\u00f6yksopp during the [[Bergen Wave]].

To date, R\u00f6yksopp has been nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s, won seven [[Spellemannprisen]] awards, performed worldwide tours, and [[R\u00f6yksopp discography|produced albums]] that have topped the charts in several countries, including four consecutive number-one albums in their [[Norway|native country]].\n\n== Band name ==\n''[[wikt:r\u00f8yksopp|R\u00f8yksopp]]'' literally means in [[English language|English]] \"smoke mushroom\".

At the same time the album became available for pre-order with Unity, Featuring Karen Harding available alongside it. The album was released on 19 August 2022. The next album in this series, [[Profound Mysteries III]] is scheduled to be released on 18 November 2022.\n\n==Style==\n\n===Musical style===\nR\u00f6yksopp's music is often referred to as \"warm\",<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> a reference to the band's downbeat electronica that combines elements of house music and Afro-American sounds.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nA notable component of R\u00f6yksopp's song repertoire relies on the use of multiple lead vocalists. For instance, ''Melody A.M.'' features the vocal talents of [[Anneli Drecker]] and [[Erlend \u00d8ye]],<ref name=\"meldoyamliner\">{{cite AV media notes| title = Melody A.M. | title-link= Melody A.M. | year= 2001 | type= CD liner | publisher = Astralwerks}}</ref> ''The Understanding'' features [[Kate Havnevik]], [[Chelonis R. Jones]], and [[Karin Dreijer Andersson]],<ref name=\"underliner\">{{cite AV media notes| title = The Understanding | title-link= The Understanding (R\u00f6yksopp album) | year= 2005 | type= CD liner | publisher = Astralwerks}}</ref> and ''Junior'' features [[Robyn]], Anneli Drecker, Karin Dreijer Andersson, and [[Lykke Li]].<ref name=\"juniorliner\">{{cite AV media notes| title = Junior | title-link= Junior (R\u00f6yksopp album) | year= 2009 | type= CD liner | publisher = Astralwerks}}</ref>\n\nR\u00f6yksopp enjoy using classic synthesizers, including the [[Monophony|monophonic]] [[Korg MS-20]], the [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Roland Juno-106]], and multiple members of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)#Akai|Akai Sampler Series]].<ref name=\"barcode\"/> The band has stated that they prefer using analogue synthesizers over digital ones.<ref name=\"interview\"/><ref name=\"barcode\"/> Svein Berge said, \"It's fairly limited the fun you can have with the use of a mouse. We like to mix.\"<ref name=\"barcode\"/>\n\nIn addition to writing their own music, the duo enjoy remixing songs.<ref name=\"barcode\"/> Berge said, \"It's obviously fun remixing people like [[Coldplay]], artists of such a big calibre. Whenever people approach us for a remix it's very nice; being approached by [[Roots Manuva]], [[The Streets]], and even [[Peter Gabriel]] is quite fun.\"<ref name=\"barcode\"/> The band was also asked by [[Britney Spears]] for a remix, but had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts.<ref name=\"musicone\"/>\n\n===Influences===\nAs they grew up in northern Norway, Svein Berge and Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland listened to [[Troms\u00f8 techno scene|local artists]] like [[Bel Canto (band)|Bel Canto]] and former Bel Canto member [[Biosphere (musician)|Biosphere]]<ref name=\"interview\"/> (whom, coincidentally, Berge and Brundtland would remix in 1997 while they were part of Alan\u00efa). The band has also expressed their interest in the music of [[Kraftwerk]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Art of Noise]], [[Vangelis]], [[Erik Satie]], and [[Francis Lai]].<ref name=\"interview\"/> Svein Berge has also stated that he is very fond of the production and programming skills of Datassette, who produced a remix of the R\u00f6yksopp single \"Happy Up Here\".<ref name=\"line\"/>\n\nR\u00f6yksopp often include references and homages to their musical influences. For instance, \"R\u00f6yksopp Forever\" pays homage to famous electronica musicians from the 1970s, including, \"the likes of [[Vangelis]] and these people, and [[Krautrock]], like [[Tangerine Dream]] and even [[Pink Floyd]] and [[King Crimson]].\"<ref name=\"line\"/>\n\n===Live performances===\nR\u00f6yksopp is known for its elaborate concert performances. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media said that \"Those who have heard R\u00f6yksopp's two albums&nbsp;... won't be surprised to learn the Norwegian duo's live set is much better and more raucuous than hunching next to the speakers at yer {{sic}} local [[Crate & Barrel]]\".<ref name=\"pitchforklive\">{{cite web | url = http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6863-royksopps-night-out/ | title = Pitchfork: Album Reviews: R\u00f6yksopp: R\u00f6yksopp's Night Out | last = Hogan | first = Marc | date = 26 April 2006 | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]] | access-date = 14 August 2010 | archive-date = 10 August 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100810144916/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6863-royksopps-night-out/ | url-status = live }}</ref> When performing live, the duo often appear in eccentric outfits.
