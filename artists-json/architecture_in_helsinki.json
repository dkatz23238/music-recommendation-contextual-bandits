The band released five studio albums before going on hiatus: ''[[Fingers Crossed (album)|Fingers Crossed]]'' (2003), ''[[In Case We Die]]'' (2005), ''[[Places Like This]]'' (2007), ''[[Moment Bends]]'' (2011), and ''[[Now + 4eva]]'' (2014). The band has been inactive since 2018.\n\n==History==\n===2000\u20132003: Formation and ''Fingers Crossed''===\nArchitecture in Helsinki developed from a short-lived high school music experiment in [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]], New South Wales, by childhood friends Cameron Bird (lead singer), Jamie Mildren and Sam Perry. By 1999, the trio had moved to the Melbourne suburb of [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], where they used the name Architecture in Helsinki for Bird's first collection of self-penned songs. Bird got the new band's name after cutting up a newspaper and re-arranging words.<ref name=\"ComeBack\"/> They played a small number of gigs before going into hiatus.<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/> In 2000, while studying photography at [[art school]], Bird met James Cecil, the two developed a musical connection and within months Cecil joined the band on drums.<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/> Around that time Bird took up guitar, he also met Kellie Sutherland at a party and invited her to play clarinet for the band.<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/><ref name=\"official\"/>\n\nThe five-member group began to work on their debut album, ''[[Fingers Crossed (album)|Fingers Crossed]]'', at Super Melody World, Cecil's recording studio built in a church hall in a south-eastern suburb.<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/><ref name=\"official\"/> Recording was halted when Bird left for an extended holiday in the US, leaving the album unfinished. Upon return from [[Portland, Oregon]], Bird was inspired to write short, catchy pop songs, which marked a new direction for the band.<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/> At art school, Bird met members of The Rhinestone Horns, a [[Brass instrument|brass ensemble]], and he recruited Isobel Knowles, Tara Shackell and Gus Franklin \u2013 all three originally from Victoria's [[Western District (Victoria)|Western District]]<ref name=\"Warrnambool\"/> \u2013 to complete Architecture in Helsinki's eight-member line-up.<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/><ref name=\"official\"/> In 2002, the group signed with independent record label, [[Trifekta]], which released their debut single, \"Like a Call\" in December. Nearly two years after starting work, ''Fingers Crossed'' was issued on 9 February 2003.<ref name=\"official\" /> Most of the group's members play multiple instruments and their music makes use of a wide range of instruments, from [[analog synthesizer]]s, [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], the [[glockenspiel]] and [[Clapping|handclaps]]; to concert band instruments like the [[trumpet]], [[tuba]], [[trombone]], [[saxophone]], [[clarinet]] and [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]; and the more standard guitars, bass guitar and drums.<ref name=\"Phares\"/>\n\n===2003\u20132005: ''In Case We Die''===\nIn 2003, Architecture in Helsinki toured Australia supporting [[The Go-Betweens]], then undertook their own east coast tour followed with a support tour for international acts, [[Yo La Tengo]], [[m\u00fam]] and [[Arab Strap (band)|Arab Strap]].<ref name=\"MAAiH2004\"/> The group issued the ''Kindling'' EP in October, which included collaborations with Qua (an [[electronica]] artist), [[B(if)tek]] (electronic duo) and [[Bogdan Raczynski]] ([[braindance]] artist).<ref name=\"MAAiH2004\"/> As a bonus on the disc, Knowles provided an animated video for \"Like a Call\".<ref name=\"MAAiH2004\"/> In December they appeared at the [[Meredith Music Festival]].<ref name=\"Warrnambool\"/> From February 2004, the group toured Japan, Europe and US.<ref name=\"Warrnambool\"/> In April, ''Fingers Crossed'' was released in North America by [[Bar/None Records]].<ref name=\"Fingers\"/>\n\nIn 2005, the group issued their second album ''[[In Case We Die]]'' on their own Tailem Bend label.<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/> It featured guest appearances by local musicians and was produced by The Carbohydrates (James Cecil and Cameron Bird's production duo) in Cecil's Super Melody World studio, now set up in a large garage space in Melbourne's inner northern suburbs. It was mixed by Tony Espie (The Avalanches, New Buffalo, Robert Palmer), at 001 Studios in Melbourne. ''[[Cyclic Defrost]]'''s Vaughan Healey described a typical gig as \"a bewildering ride through dynamic tempo changes, finger clicks and swapped instruments. You never really know who is going to sing or what will happen next, and somehow the eight-piece juggles this anarchic structure with a music class worth of instruments and staging rearrangements.\"<ref name=\"Healey\"/>\n\nFor the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2005]], the album received three nominations: 'Best Independent Release', 'Best Cover Art' (by Bird) and 'Best Adult Contemporary Release'.<ref name=\"ARIA2005\"/> The song \"It'5!\" (pronounced \"it's five\") received wide airplay on the national radio network [[Triple J]] and reached No.&nbsp;56 in their annual [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2005|Hottest 100 for 2005]].<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/>\n\n===2006-2008: Line-up changes,  ''We Died, They Remixed'' and ''Places Like This''===\nIn mid-2006, Architecture in Helsinki announced via their [[MySpace]] page that Knowles and Shackell were no longer members and cited \"creative conflicts\" with Bird as the reason for their departure.<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/><ref name=\"Pearson\"/> Knowles continued with her work in animation and music.<ref name=\"R&D\"/> In September 2007, Franklin, Knowles, Shackell and Sutherland provided the brass section on the [[Kevin Ayers]] album ''[[The Unfairground]]''.<ref name=\"AMGKA\"/><ref name=\"Ayers\"/> Shackell returned to tertiary studies and is a [[Ceramic art|ceramicist]].<ref name=\"CraftVic\"/>\n\nOn 28 October 2006, as a six-member group, Architecture in Helsinki released ''[[We Died, They Remixed]]'', a [[remix album]] consisting of all tracks from ''In Case We Die'', and the song \"Like a Call\" from ''Fingers Crossed''.<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/><ref name=\"Pearson\"/> Artists who provided remixes included [[Hot Chip]], [[Sally Seltmann|New Buffalo]], [[Safety Scissors]], [[DAT politics]], [[Mocky]] and [[Isan (band)|Isan]].<ref name=\"MAAiH\"/>\n\nArchitecture in Helsinki released their next album, ''[[Places Like This]]'' on 28 July 2007 on [[Polyvinyl Record Co.]] In September 2006, [[Pitchfork Media]] reported that they were working on tracks with Bird in Brooklyn and other members in Melbourne.<ref name=\"Pearson\"/> It was recorded at [[Dave Sitek]]'s (from  [[TV on the Radio]])<ref name=\"JunkMedia\"/> studio in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] and in Sydney's Big Jesus Burger Studios between October 2006 and January 2007. It was engineered and mixed by Chris Coady, who has previously worked with [[TV on the Radio]], [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]] and [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]]. The first single from the album, \"Heart It Races\", was released ahead of the album in May and peaked into the top&nbsp;50 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> ''Places Like This'' reached the top&nbsp;30 on the related albums chart.<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> In the US, the album reached the top&nbsp;10 on two of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's component charts: [[Dance/Electronic Albums|Top Electronic Albums]] and [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums]] in September.<ref name=\"BillboardA\"/>\n[[File:ArchitectureInHelsinki2007SXSW.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Architecture in Helsinki performing at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in [[Austin, Texas]], in March 2007.]]\nEven though the group's name includes Finland's capital [[Helsinki]], they first played there at the Flow Festival in August 2007: \"When we were in Norway at the end of last year there were a few Finnish interviewers who came to interview us mainly about the name. I think they were quite perplexed. To us, the name means having to answer many questions and inquiries about the name, which I guess, is entirely understandable.\" Sam Perry said.<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>\n\nThe band also issued other singles, \"Debbie\", \"Hold Music\", and \"Like It Or Not\". At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2007]], \"Heart It Races\" was nominated as 'Single of the Year'.<ref name=\"ARIA2007\"/> \"Heart It Races\" and \"Hold Music\" were listed in the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2007|2007 Triple J Hottest 100]] at No.&nbsp;19 and No.&nbsp;36, respectively.<ref name=\"TripleJHot\"/> In 2007, they did a Take Away Show acoustic video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].\n\nDuring the ensemble's New Year's Eve performance on 1 January 2008, they came on at midnight, they announced that it was James Cecil's last show with Architecture in Helsinki. After leaving the band, Cecil provided backing vocals, engineering and mixing for Kes Band's 2008 album ''Kes Band'' and drums for Qua's 2011 release ''Q&A''.<ref name=\"AMGJamC\"/>\n\n===2008\u20132012: ''Moment Bends''===\nIn mid-2008, the band hired long time mentor and collaborator [[Fran\u00e7ois T\u00e9taz]] to help them produce their fourth album. Work began immediately in a new studio space, named Buckingham Palace, that the band had set up in Melbourne's East Brunswick.\nIn November 2008, the five-piece released \"That Beep\", the first taste of a new sound that they would develop with T\u00e9taz over a two-year period. T\u00e9taz was working simultaneously on Gotye's ''[[Making Mirrors]]'' album, toggling between the two records.\nIn October 2010, the band announced via [[Twitter]]<ref name=\"AIHmusic\"/> that the record was finished after more than two years in self-imposed studio exile. \nIn January 2011, the first single issued from the album came in the form of \"Contact High\", which would later become the most popular song Architecture in Helsinki had released in Australia. It was nominated for Pop Release of the Year at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2011]] and polled at number 12 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2011|Triple J Hottest 100 for 2011]], Australia's largest musical democracy.\n''[[Moment Bends]]'' was released in April 2011 in Australia<ref name=\"modular\"/> and in May 2011 in the US<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> and featured a more detailed, produced and focused pop sound than on their previous records.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} ''Moment Bends'' debuted at number 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart in Australia, the highest chart position for the band. Two further singles from ''Moment Bends'', \"Escapee\" and \"W.O.W\", were released. \"Escapee\" is featured in the football video game, ''[[FIFA 12]]'', which was published by [[EA Sports]].\n\n===2012\u20132014: ''Now + 4eva''===\nIn early 2012, the band began work on their follow up to ''Moment Bends'', deciding to stick with the polished pop sound that had worked on the previous album. They recorded in a makeshift studio above a caf\u00e9 in Melbourne. The space had previously been a hideaway for junkies. As a result, during recording the band tried to combat the negative energy previously associated with the space. To promote the album, the band set up a temporary concept store in [[Melbourne Central Shopping Centre]]. It was open from 28 March 2014 until 6 April 2014. Bird described the store as \"an opportunity to forge a vibrant new connection with our audience and in turn, explore new ideas of what music retail could be.\" It sold the album on vinyl, CD, cassette, and USB, in addition to other products such as jewelry, drink bottles, rock candy figurines of the band members, a fashion line, and prints of the album's cover art. The products were commissioned from local designers and friends of the band. The album's singles were \"I Might Survive,\" \"In the Future,\" and \"Dream a Little Crazy.\" It was released on 28 March 2014 in Australia and New Zealand, and on 1 April 2014 in North America.<ref name=\"saturdaypaper\" />\n\n===2014\u20132018: Final years===\nAfter the tour cycle for ''Now + 4eva'', the band took an informal sabbatical. Bird stated from 2004 to 2014, they had been in a constant album cycle and \"there comes a time that you need to step away in order to have that life experience that you can turn into new work.\" During this time, the band had sporadic performances, including in an episode of the Australian children's educational show [[Play School (Australian TV series)|''Play School'']] where they covered the song \"Big Bass Drum\" with toy instruments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rtrfm.com.au/story/art-itecture-in-helsinki/|title=ART-itecture In Helsinki|date=23 May 2018|website=Alternative Frequencies}}</ref> Bird and Cecil also helped produce the second album for [[The Goon Sax]] in 2018. In May 2018, the band announced a headline set at Kennedy Art Ball at the [[Art Gallery of Western Australia]] in [[Perth]]. Bird said that in the current incarnation of the band, there are six members instead of the usual nine. They also announced that they were setting up a space to record new music. Bird said that the band was \"not really on a schedule - we're just making, and when we make something that we're proud of, we'll put it out into the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/music/architecture-in-helsinkis-artful-return-ng-b88840653z|title=Architecture in Helsinki's artful WA return|date=18 May 2018|website=The West Australian}}</ref> The band has, however, been completely inactive since this announcement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\n==Band members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Final lineup\n*Cameron Bird \u2013 lead and backing vocals, guitar, keyboards {{small|(2000\u20132018)}}<ref name=\"Healey\"/><ref name=\"AMGCam\"/>\n*Sam Perry \u2013 bass guitar, keyboards {{small|(2000\u20132018)}}<ref name=\"AMGSam\"/>\n*Kellie Sutherland \u2013 lead and backing vocals, keyboards, clarinet {{small|(2000\u20132018)}}<ref name=\"Healey\"/><ref name=\"AMGKel\"/>\n*Gus Franklin \u2013 keyboard, guitar, vocals, trombone, drums {{small|(2002\u20132018)}}<ref name=\"AMGGus\"/>\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Former members\n*James Cecil \u2013 drums, guitars, keyboards {{small|(2000\u20132008)}}<ref name=\"Healey\"/><ref name=\"AMGJamC\"/>\n*Jamie Mildren \u2013 guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, flute {{small|(2000\u20132015)}}<ref name=\"Healey\"/><ref name=\"AMGJamM\"/>\n*Tara Shackell \u2013 tuba, trombone, keyboards, backing vocals {{small|(2002\u20132006)}}<ref name=\"Healey\"/><ref name=\"AMGTar\"/>\n*Isobel Knowles \u2013 trumpet, keyboards, backing vocals {{small|(2002\u20132006)}}<ref name=\"Healey\"/><ref name=\"AMGIso\"/>\n*Ben Donnan \u2013 drums, keyboards {{small|(2008\u20132014)}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Tours==\nThe band toured heavily throughout Australia, the United States, and Europe, playing festivals such as [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Sasquatch!
