Most of his best known singles were recordings of songs written by other song writers, though he composed a number of songs for most of his albums as well, often in conjunction with songwriting partner [[Chris Stainton]].<ref name=\"Indep23dec14\"/>\n\nHis [[With a Little Help from My Friends (Joe Cocker album)|first album]] featured a recording of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[With a Little Help from My Friends#Joe Cocker version|With a Little Help from My Friends]]\", which brought him to near-instant stardom. The song reached number one in the UK in 1968, became a staple of his many live shows ([[Woodstock]] and the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight]] in 1969, the [[Party at the Palace]] in 2002) and was also known as the theme song for the late 1980s American TV series ''[[The Wonder Years]]''. He continued his success with his [[Joe Cocker!|second album]], which included a second Beatles song: \"[[She Came In Through the Bathroom Window]]\". A hastily thrown together 1970 U.S. tour led to the live double-album ''[[Mad Dogs & Englishmen (album)|Mad Dogs & Englishmen]]'', which featured an all-star band organized by [[Leon Russell]].  His 1974 recording of \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\" reached number five in the U.S., and became his [[signature song]].  Cocker's best selling song was the U.S. number one \"[[Up Where We Belong]]\", a duet with [[Jennifer Warnes]] that earned a 1983 [[Grammy Award]].  He released a total of 22 studio albums over a 43-year recording career.  \n\nIn 1993, Cocker was nominated for the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Best British Male. He was awarded a bronze [[Sheffield Legends]] plaque in his hometown in 2007, and received an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] the following year for services to music.<ref name=\"Brits\" /><ref name=\"OBE\" /> Cocker was ranked number 97 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s 100 greatest singers list.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Singers |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=27 November 2008 |access-date=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Early life (1944\u20131960) ==\n[[File:Sheffield Legends Joe Cocker.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sheffield Legends]] plaque in Cocker's home city of [[Sheffield]], England]]\nCocker was born on 20 May 1944 at 38 Tasker Road, [[Crookes]], [[Sheffield]].

Cocker's first experience singing in public was at age 12 when his elder brother Victor invited him on stage to sing during a gig of his [[skiffle]] group. In 1960, along with three friends, Cocker formed his first group, the Cavaliers. For the group's first performance at a youth club, they were required to pay the price of admission before entering.

Despite extensive promotion from Decca lauding his youth and working-class roots, the record was a flop and his recording contract with Decca lapsed at the end of 1964.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=28}} After Cocker recorded the single, he dropped his stage name and formed a new group, Joe Cocker's Blues Band.

The Grease Band came to the attention of [[Denny Cordell]], the producer of [[Procol Harum]], [[the Moody Blues]] and [[Georgie Fame]]. Cocker recorded the single \"Marjorine\" without the Grease Band for Cordell in a London studio. He then moved to London with Chris Stainton, and the Grease Band was dissolved. Cordell set Cocker up with a residency at the [[Marquee Club]] in London, and a \"new\" Grease Band was formed with Stainton and keyboardist [[Tommy Eyre]].{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=43\u201345}}\n\n{{Listen|filename=Joe Cocker - 09 - With A Little Help From My Friends.ogg|title=Sample from Cocker's 1968 version of \"With A Little Help From My Friends\"|description=Drums by [[Procol Harum]]'s B.J.

The recording features lead guitar from [[Jimmy Page]], drumming by [[B. J. Wilson]], backing vocals from [[Sue and Sunny]], and Tommy Eyre on organ.

Cocker's album ''[[With a Little Help from My Friends (Joe Cocker album)|With a Little Help from My Friends]]'' was released soon after their arrival and made number 35 on the American charts, eventually going gold.{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n[[File:Woodstock redmond cocker01.jpg|thumb|Cocker at [[Woodstock]] (1969)]]\nDuring his US tour, Cocker played at several large festivals, including the [[Newport Pop Festival|Newport Rock Festival]] and the [[Denver Pop Festival]]. In August, Denny Cordell heard about the planned concert in [[Woodstock, New York]] and convinced organiser [[Artie Kornfeld]] to book Cocker and the Grease Band for the [[Woodstock]] Festival. The group had to be flown into the festival by helicopter due to the large crowds. They performed several songs, including \"[[Feelin' Alright?]]\", \"Something's Comin' On\", \"[[Let's Go Get Stoned (R&B song)|Let's Go Get Stoned]]\", \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". Cocker would later say that the experience was \"like an eclipse&nbsp;... it was a very special day.\"{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=58\u201360}}\n\nDirectly after Woodstock, Cocker released his second album, ''[[Joe Cocker!]]'' Impressed by his version of \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] allowed Cocker to use their songs \"[[She Came In Through the Bathroom Window]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\" for the album.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=61}} Recorded during a break in touring in the spring and summer, the album reached number 11 on the US charts and garnered a second UK [[Chart hit|hit]] with the [[Leon Russell]] song, \"Delta Lady\".\n\nIn August 1969, Cocker performed at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight Festival]] at [[Wootton Bridge]], [[Isle of Wight]], England.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/hampshire/content/articles/2005/04/08/iowfestival_history_feature.shtml \"Isle of Wight Festival.- History\"].

Onstage, he exhibited an idiosyncratic physical intensity, flailing his arms and playing [[air guitar]]. At the end of the year Cocker was unwilling to embark on another US tour, so he dissolved the Grease Band.\n\n=== Mad Dogs & Englishmen (1970\u20131971) ===\n[[File:Joe Cocker 72.jpg|thumb|left|Cocker in concert at Palasport, Rome, July 1972]]\nDespite Cocker's reluctance to venture out on the road again, an American tour had already been booked so he had to quickly form a new band in order to fulfill his contractual obligations. It proved to be a large group of more than 20 musicians, including pianist and bandleader [[Leon Russell]], three drummers \u2013 [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], [[Jim Keltner]], and Chuck Blackwell, and backing vocalists [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Claudia Lennear]]. Denny Cordell christened the new band \"Mad Dogs & Englishmen\", after the [[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|No\u00ebl Coward song of the same name]] (with its refrain, \"Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun\"). Cocker's music evolved into a more bluesy type of rock, comparable to that of [[the Rolling Stones]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/joe-cocker-dies-of-lung-cancer-at-70/78688/ | title=Joe Cocker Dies Of Lung Cancer At 70 | publisher=www.prefixmag.com | date=22 December 2014 | access-date=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ensuing Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour (later described by drummer Jim Keltner as \"a big, wild party\"),{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=70}} Cocker toured 48 cities, recorded a live album, and received very positive reviews from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' for his performances. However, the pace of the tour was exhausting. Russell and Cocker had personal problems; Cocker became depressed and began drinking excessively as the tour wound down in May 1970. Meanwhile, he enjoyed several chart entries in the United States with cover versions of \"[[Feelin' Alright?|Feelin' Alright]]\" (originally recorded by [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]]) and \"[[Cry Me a River (1953 song)|Cry Me a River]]\".\n\nHis version of [[the Box Tops]]' hit \"[[The Letter (Box Tops song)|The Letter]]\", which appeared on the live album and film, ''[[Mad Dogs & Englishmen (album)|Mad Dogs & Englishmen]]'', became his first US Top Ten [[hit record|hit]]. After spending several months in [[Los Angeles]], Cocker returned home to Sheffield, where his family became increasingly concerned with his deteriorating physical and [[mental health]]. During this time, in periods between work, Cocker wrote the overture played by the UK Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] on the occasion the Prime Minister famously conducted a live orchestra while in office.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=79}} In the summer of 1971, [[A&M Records]] released the single \"High Time We Went\". This became a hit, reaching number 22 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, but was not issued on an album until November 1972 on the ''[[Joe Cocker (1972 album)|Joe Cocker]]'' album.\n\n=== On the road (1972\u20131982) ===\nIn early 1972, after nearly two years away from music, Cocker went on tour with a group that Chris Stainton had formed. He opened with a performance in [[Madison Square Garden]] which was attended by about 20,000 people. After touring the United States, he embarked on a European tour where he played to large audiences in [[Milan]] and Germany. He then returned to the United States for another tour in autumn 1972. During these tours the group cut the songs that would be part of his newest album, ''[[Joe Cocker (album)|Joe Cocker]]''. A mixture of live songs and studio recordings, the album peaked at number 30 on the US charts.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Joe cocker.jpg|thumb|Cocker performing on 16 October 1980 at the [[National Stadium (Ireland)|National Stadium]], Dublin]]\nIn October 1972, when Cocker toured [[Australia]], he and six members of his entourage were arrested in [[Adelaide]] for possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=anh&AN=200210101022405517&site=ehost-live&scope=site|title = Joe's back \u2013 and not looking for trouble|last = Williams|first = Nadine|date = 10 October 2002|access-date = 13 January 2016|newspaper = The Advertiser (Adelaide)|page = 22|publisher = News Ltd.|edition = State|location = Adelaide, South Australia|id = EBSCO Host Accession Number: 200210101022405517}}</ref> The next day, in [[Melbourne]], assault charges were laid after a brawl at the Commodore Chateau Hotel,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MfgKAAAAIBAJ&pg=5586,5519884&dq=joe+cocker+commodore+chateau |title= Joe Cocker |access-date=27 December 2008 |date=15 October 1972 |work=Prescott Courier }}</ref> and the [[Australian Federal Police]] gave Cocker 48 hours to leave the country. This caused huge public outcry in Australia, as Cocker was a high-profile overseas artist and had a strong support base, especially amongst the [[baby boomers]] who were coming of age and able to vote for the first time. It sparked hefty debate about the use and legalisation of marijuana in Australia, and gained Cocker the nickname \"the Mad Dog\".{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=101}}\n\nShortly after the Australian tour, Stainton retired from his music career to establish his own recording studio. After his friend's departure and his estrangement from his longtime producer Denny Cordell, Cocker sank into depression and began using [[heroin]]. In June 1973, he kicked the habit but continued to drink heavily.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=110}}\n\nAt the end of 1973, Cocker returned to the studio to record a new album, ''[[I Can Stand a Little Rain]]''. The album, released in August 1974, was number 11 on the US charts and one single, a recording of [[Billy Preston]]'s \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\", which reached the number 5 slot.{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=112\u201314}} Despite positive reviews for the album, Cocker struggled with live performances, largely due to his problems with alcohol. One such instance was reported in a 1974 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', which said that during two [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] performances in October of that year he threw up onstage.<ref>''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine \u2014 \"Random Notes\" \u2014 21 November 1974, page 13</ref>\n\nIn January 1975, he released a second album that had been recorded at the same time as ''I Can Stand a Little Rain'', ''[[Jamaica Say You Will]]''. To promote his new album, Cocker embarked on another tour of Australia, made possible by the country's new [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government. In late 1975, he contributed vocals on a number of the tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album. He also recorded a new album in a [[Kingston, Jamaica]] studio, ''[[Stingray (album)|Stingray]]''. However, record sales were disappointing; the album reached only number 70 on the US charts.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=122}}\n\nIn 1976, Cocker performed \"Feelin' Alright\" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. [[John Belushi]] joined him onstage doing his famous impersonation of Cocker's stage movements. At the time, Cocker was $800,000 in debt to [[A&M Records]] and struggling with alcoholism. Several months later, he met producer [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]], who agreed to manage him on the condition that he stay sober. With a new band, Cocker embarked on a tour of [[New Zealand]], Australia and [[South America]]. He then recorded a new album with [[Session musician|session]] work by [[Steve Gadd]] and [[Chuck Rainey]], and a new, young bassist from Scotland, Rob Hartley. Hartley also toured briefly with Cocker's friends in 1977. In the autumn of 1978, Cocker toured North America promoting his album, ''[[Luxury You Can Afford]]''. Despite this effort, it received mixed reviews and only sold around 300,000 copies.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=140}}\n\nIn 1979, Cocker joined the \"Woodstock in Europe\" tour, which featured musicians like [[Arlo Guthrie]] and [[Richie Havens]] who had played at the 1969 Woodstock Festival. He also performed in New York's [[Central Park]] to an audience of 20,000 people. The concert was recorded and released as the live album, ''Live in New York''.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=143}} Cocker also toured Europe and appeared on the German television recording amphitheatre ''[[Rockpalast]]'', the first of many performances on the show. In 1982, Cocker recorded two songs with the jazz group [[The Crusaders (Houston group)|the Crusaders]] on their album ''[[Standing Tall (The Crusaders album)|Standing Tall]]''. One song, \"I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today\", was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] and Cocker performed it with the Crusaders at the awards ceremony. The Crusaders wrote this song with Cocker in mind to sing it. Cocker then released a new reggae-influenced album, ''[[Sheffield Steel]]'', recorded with the [[Compass Point All Stars]], produced by [[Chris Blackwell]] and [[Alex Sadkin]].\n\n=== Later career (1982\u20132014) ===\n[[File:JoeCocker03.jpg|thumb|Cocker playing [[air guitar]] in [[Hallandale Beach, Florida]], in 2003]]\nIn 1982 Cocker recorded the duet \"[[Up Where We Belong]]\" with [[Jennifer Warnes]] for the soundtrack of the film ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]''. The song was an international hit, reaching number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and winning a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo]]. The duet also won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], and Cocker and Warnes performed the song at the awards ceremony.\n\nSeveral days later, he was invited to perform \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\" with [[Ray Charles]] in a television tribute to the musician.
