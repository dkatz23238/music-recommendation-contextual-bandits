The band originally performed under the name Saron Gas until 2002, when they moved to the United States and changed it to Seether to avoid confusion with the deadly chemical known as [[sarin|sarin gas]]. Lead vocalist and guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]] is the band's longest serving member, bassist [[Dale Stewart]] joined shortly after formation while drummer John Humphrey joined them for the band's second album. Since 2018, the band has been employing second guitarist [[Corey Lowery]]. Several notable guitarists like Corey's brother [[Clint Lowery|Clint]] and [[Troy McLawhorn]] have toured or recorded with the band, however, Shaun has recorded most guitar parts for the band's records.\n\nSeether gained mainstream popularity in 2002 with their US Active Rock number one single \"[[Fine Again]]\". Their success was sustained in 2004 with the single \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\", which peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. They have experienced continued success with many number one hits on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, such as \"[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]\", \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", \"[[Country Song (Seether song)|Country Song]]\", \"[[Tonight (Seether song)|Tonight]]\", \"[[Words as Weapons (Seether song)|Words as Weapons]]\", \"[[Let You Down (Seether song)|Let You Down]]\" and \"[[Dangerous (Seether song)|Dangerous]]\", \"[[Bruised and Bloodied]]\", and \"Wasteland\". The band has released eight studio albums; their most recent, ''[[Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum (album)|Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum]]'', was released on 28 August 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/seether-dangerous-song-lyrics-si-vis-pacem-para-bellum-album/ |title=Seether Debut New Song 'Dangerous' + Announce Eighth Album | website=Loudwire.com|access-date=24 June 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation as Saron Gas (1999\u20132001)===\nThe band formed in South Africa in May 1999 under the name Saron Gas.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\">{{cite web|author=Bradley Torreano |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/seether-mn0000625731/biography |title=Seether &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref> Consisting of [[frontman]], vocalist, and guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist Tyronne Morris (who left the band in December 1999 and was replaced by Dale Stewart in January 2000), and drummer Dave Cohoe, the band released their first album, ''Fragile'', in October 2000 under [[Johannesburg]]-based [[independent record label]] Musketeer Records.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Despite the region's focus primarily on [[pop music|pop]] and [[indigenous music]], the band found success, and eventually caught attention of American record label [[Wind-up Records]], who gave them a record deal to begin releasing music in [[North America]].<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Upon signing to the label, they were told they needed to change their name due to its similarity to [[sarin gas]], and switched to calling themselves [[Seether (song)|Seether]], after the [[Veruca Salt]] song.<ref name=\"AXS1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.axs.com/seether-5-most-pivotal-moments-84248|title=Seether: 5 most pivotal moments - AXS|date=17 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517104228/http://www.axs.com/seether-5-most-pivotal-moments-84248|access-date=6 October 2020|archive-date=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''Disclaimer'' releases (2002\u20132004)===\nIn August 2002, Seether launched their first official album, ''Disclaimer'', which earned the band three singles: \"[[Fine Again]]\", \"[[Driven Under]]\", and \"[[Gasoline (Seether song)|Gasoline]]\", in which only the first managed significant success. After the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured constantly. Near the end of the Disclaimer Tour, they decided to return to the studio to record their second album, a project that had to be delayed by almost a year, since at that time Seether was on a world tour with [[Evanescence]]. \"Fine Again\" was also included in the video games ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' in 2002 and ''[[1080\u00b0 Avalanche]]'' in 2003.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured continually in order to increase sales and gain name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an Evanescence worldwide tour. Seether reworked their [[acoustic music|acoustic]] ballad \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\" into an electric ballad with guest vocals by [[Amy Lee]] of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled \"Sold Me\", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time.\n\nMorgan has stated that the reworking of \"Broken\" was due to the wishes of the record company rather than those of the band.<ref name=fastloud>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |title=Seether feels the cold on |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=18 July 2006 |access-date=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011051304/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |archive-date=11 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> An alternate version of the original album, with many of its songs [[remix]]ed or re-recorded, was released in June 2004 and entitled ''[[Disclaimer II]]''.

Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of \"Needles\" and \"Burrito\" from the album is due to the label's desire that it contain no obscenities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seether|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/seether-tickets/index.html|publisher=Frontrowking.com|access-date=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nGuitarist [[Patrick Callahan]]'s departure from the band was announced on 15 June 2006.

Pat also did not like certain band decisions. One example was the band being on the Punisher and Daredevil soundtrack in which he did not like the lineup of bands they were associated with. [[Shaun Morgan]] himself later commented on Pat's departure:\n:\"''Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him.''\"<ref name=fastloud/>\n\nMorgan entered a rehabilitation program for what he felt was \"dependence on a combination of substances\" in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with [[Staind]] and [[Three Days Grace]].<ref name=\"MTV2007\">{{cite web |title=Seether Frontman Enters Rehab; August Tour Dates Canceled - MTV |author=Chris Harris |website=[[MTV]] |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1537141/seether-frontman-enters-rehab-august-tour-dates-canceled/ |date=26 July 2006 |access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' (2007\u20132009)===\n[[File:USMC-101217-M-2339L-028.jpg|thumb|Seether performing in 2008]]\nShaun Morgan, prior to the next album's release, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. ''[[Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces]]'' was slated for an August 2007 release but was delayed until 23 October 2007 due to the [[suicide]] of Morgan's brother, Eugene Welgemoed. The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured \"Candice the Ghost\", and was illustrated by [[David Ho (artist)|David Ho]]. The first single, \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", reached the top position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for [[WWE]]'s [[No Way Out (2008)]]. \"[[Rise Above This]]\", written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No.&nbsp;2 on its mainstream counterpart, [[Mainstream Rock Songs]]. The final single from the album was \"Breakdown\", the video for which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original scheduled release date of 23 October. ''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' won Seether's first [[South African Music Awards|South African Music Award]] in the category \"Best Rock: English\", as well as their first [[MTV Africa Music Awards|MTV Africa Music Award]] for \"Best Alternative Artist\".\n\nA tour launched in support of the album in early 2008 lasted much of the year. [[Troy McLawhorn]] of [[Dark New Day]], [[Evanescence]], and [[doubleDrive]] was hired as a touring guitarist on 15 February 2008.
