''Robots in Disguise'' featured the single \"Boys\". The cover for \"Boys\" featured a mimic of Roxy Music's ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]''.

It featured the singles \"Turn It Up\" and \"The DJ's Got a Gun\". \n\n=== ''We're in the Music Biz'' (2006\u20132008) ===\nThe band's third studio album, ''[[We're in the Music Biz]]'', was released through President in 2008, and was again produced by Chris Corner. It featured the single \"[[The Sex Has Made Me Stupid]]\", as well as new single \"The Tears\". ''We're in the Music Biz'' has a deceivingly innocent looking album cover, with the girls appearing to wear shirts and ties when in fact they are topless and the \"clothes\" are simply body paint.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article3284940.ece|title=Robots in Disguise: We're in the Music Biz review|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Wake Up!'' and ''Happiness v Sadness'' (2009\u2013present) ===\nThe band recorded their fourth studio album in London in late 2009, but ran out of money before its completion.
