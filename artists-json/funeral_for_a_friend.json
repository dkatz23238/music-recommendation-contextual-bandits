Achieving both a [[gold certification]] and three top-twenty singles in their home country, ''Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation'' is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. ''[[Hours (Funeral for a Friend album)|Hours]]'' (2005) featured a similar musical style to their debut, but also featured more melodic sensibilities, and ''[[Tales Don't Tell Themselves]]'' (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend's musical style from that which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use of [[screaming (music)|screaming]] vocals and [[post-hardcore]]-influenced guitars, favoring a more melodic rock influence. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK.\n\nFuneral for a Friend self-released their fourth album, ''[[Memory and Humanity]]'' (2008) through their short-lived record label ''Join Us'', the album arguably being their most eclectic to date. Following this the band tied themselves to other independent labels for ''[[Welcome Home Armageddon]]'' (2011)  ''[[Conduit (album)|Conduit]]'' (2013), and ''[[Chapter and Verse (Funeral for a Friend album)|Chapter and Verse]]'' (2015), which showed the band returning to the more metal and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]-influenced the style of their earlier work. In September 2015, they announced their break-up and final tour in 2016. On 21 May 2016, they played their last performance to a sold-out [[The Forum, London|Forum]] in [[London]].\n\nIn October 2019 Funeral for a Friend reunited as a live band, initially for three benefit shows \u2013 two in [[Cardiff]] at the Cardiff University Student Union followed by one in [[London]] at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Following a planned performance at the canceled 2020 [[Download Festival]], they announced a headline UK tour for April 2021 playing songs from their first three albums.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years (2001\u20132003)===\n{{Main|Between Order and Model|Seven Ways to Scream Your Name}}\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=because when we started out we didn't think we'd reach the level we've reached.

Soon afterward, the band reformed as Funeral for a Friend; the name is derived from a song by [[Planes Mistaken for Stars]], one of Davies' favourite bands at the time.<ref name=\"leedsmusic 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsmusicscene.net/article/2338/|title=Funeral for a Friend Interview 2004|first=John|last=Harvey|publisher=leedsmusicscene|date=8 February 2004|access-date=12 November 2011|archive-date=7 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707064439/http://www.leedsmusicscene.net/article/2338/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the start of the New Year they parted ways with second guitarist Kerry Roberts (Kris Coombs-Roberts's brother) and found a suitable replacement in Darran Smith (ex-Tripcage). The band recorded four tracks at Mighty Atom Studios for a proposed self-financed EP with another Welsh band ''From This Moment On''. Upon hearing the tracks, [[Mighty Atom Records]] approached the band and offered a two-album deal, resulting in their debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Between Order and Model]]'' (2002). Before the EP's release, Andi Morris (bass) quit to join death metal band Amputated, with Phillips and Evans also leaving. The band then recruited Gareth Davies (later Ellis-Davies) on bass and Ryan Richards on drums. Matt Davies became the band's only primary vocalist, with Gareth Davies performing backing melodies and Richards taking over Evans' screaming role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2003, Funeral for a Friend recorded their second EP, ''[[Four Ways to Scream Your Name]]'', produced and mixed by [[Colin Richardson]]. In mid-2003, the band secured their first ''[[Kerrang!]]'' award, winning the award for \"Best UK Newcomer\", beating [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], who won in all other nominated categories. Funeral for a Friend's win was largely attributed to their fervent fan base, as the awards winner was decided by public vote online at the official ''Kerrang!'' Web site.

Several other shows were scheduled in the UK to complement these rescheduled dates, and the tour culminated in a slot below headliners [[Guns N' Roses]] at the [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington Park]].

Only 200 tickets were available for each show and these had to be applied for via an e-mail sent to members of the FFAF mailing list. Names were then picked out of a hat and the selected people were offered the opportunity to buy a pair of tickets to the gig, exclusive T-shirts were given to anyone paying using PayPal mobile. On 8 May 2007 the band released ''Tales Don't Tell Themselves'' in its entirety for fans to preview via their MySpace page. This album is the first on which Matt plays guitar.
