Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nBorn in [[Alton, Illinois]], and raised in [[East St. Louis]], Davis left to study at [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] in [[New York City]], before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Charlie Parker]]'s [[bebop]] quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' sessions for [[Capitol Records]], which were instrumental to the development of [[cool jazz]]. In the early 1950s, Davis recorded some of the earliest [[hard bop]] music while on [[Prestige Records]] but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], he signed a long-term contract with [[Columbia Records]] and recorded the album ''[['Round About Midnight]]'' in 1955.{{sfn|Yanow|2005|p=176}} It was his first work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]] and bassist [[Paul Chambers]], key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger [[Gil Evans]], such as the Spanish music-influenced ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960), and band recordings, such as ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958) and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959).<ref name=\"aar\"/> The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,{{sfn|McCurdy|2004|p=61}} having sold over five million copies in the U.S.\n\nDavis made several line-up changes while recording ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come (Miles Davis album)|Someday My Prince Will Come]]'' (1961), his [[In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, Complete|1961 Blackhawk concerts]], and ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist [[Ron Carter]], pianist [[Herbie Hancock]], and drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].<ref name=\"aar\"/> After adding saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]] to his new quintet in 1964,<ref name=\"aar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/miles-davis-innovative-influential-and-respected-jazz-legend|title=Miles Davis, innovative, influential, and respected jazz legend|publisher=African American Registry|access-date=June 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809095005/http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/miles-davis-innovative-influential-and-respected-jazz-legend|archive-date=August 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the [[post-bop]] genre with albums such as ''[[E.S.P.

Davis was hired for other studio dates in 1951{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=25}} and began to transcribe scores for record labels to fund his heroin addiction. His second session for Prestige was released on ''[[The New Sounds]]'' (1951), ''[[Dig (Miles Davis album)|Dig]]'' (1956), and ''[[Conception (album)|Conception]]'' (1956).{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=26}}\n\nDavis supported his heroin habit by playing music and by living the life of a hustler, exploiting prostitutes, and receiving money from friends. By 1953, his addiction began to impair his playing. His drug habit became public in a ''DownBeat'' interview with [[Cab Calloway]], whom he never forgave as it brought him \"all pain and suffering\".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=164}} He returned to St. Louis and stayed with his father for several months.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=164}} After a brief period with Roach and Mingus in September 1953,{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=164\u2013165}} he returned to his father's home, where he concentrated on addressing his addiction.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nDavis lived in Detroit for about six months, avoiding New York City, where it was easy to get drugs.

He was also \"pimping a little\".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=171}} However, he was able to end his addiction, and, in February 1954, Davis returned to New York City, feeling good \"for the first time in a long time\", mentally and physically stronger, and joined a gym.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=174, 175, 184}} He informed Weinstock and [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] that he was ready to record with a quintet, which he was granted.

He assumed a central role in [[hard bop]], less radical in harmony and melody, and used popular songs and American standards as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop distanced itself from cool jazz with a harder beat and music inspired by the blues.<ref>Open references to the blues in jazz playing were fairly recent. Until the middle of the 1930s, as Coleman Hawkins declared to [[Alan Lomax]] (''The Land Where the Blues Began.''

Davis had one year left on his contract with Prestige, which required him to release four more albums. He signed a contract with Columbia that included a $4,000 advance ({{Inflation|US|4000|1955|r=-1|fmt=eq}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}) and required that his recordings for Columbia remain unreleased until his agreement with Prestige expired.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=96}}{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=192}}\n\nAt the request of Avakian, he formed the [[Miles Davis Quintet]] for a performance at [[Caf\u00e9 Bohemia]]. The quintet contained Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on double bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums. Rollins was replaced by [[John Coltrane]], completing the membership of the first quintet. To fulfill Davis' contract with Prestige, this new group worked through [[The Legendary Prestige Quintet Sessions|two marathon sessions]] in May and October 1956 that were released by the label as four LPs: ''[[Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1957), ''[[Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1958), ''[[Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1960) and ''[[Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1961). Each album was critically acclaimed and helped establish Davis's quintet as one of the best.{{sfn|Chambers|1998|p=223}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=45}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=99}}\n\nThe style of the group was an extension of their experience playing with Davis. He played long, legato, melodic lines, while Coltrane contrasted with energetic solos. Their live repertoire was a mix of bebop, standards from the [[Great American Songbook]] and pre-bop eras, and traditional tunes. They appeared on ''[['Round About Midnight]]'', Davis's first album for Columbia.\n\nIn 1956, he left his quintet temporarily to tour Europe as part of the Birdland All-Stars, which included the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] and French and German musicians. In Paris, he reunited with Gr\u00e9co and they \"were lovers for many years\".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=186}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=215}} He then returned home, reunited his quintet and toured the US for two months. Conflict arose on tour when he grew impatient with the drug habits of Jones and Coltrane. Davis was trying to live a healthier life by exercising and reducing his alcohol. But he continued to use cocaine.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=209}} At the end of the tour, he fired Jones and Coltrane and replaced them with Sonny Rollins and [[Art Taylor]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=214}}\n\nIn November 1957, Davis went to Paris and recorded the [[Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud''. <ref name=\"New Grove\" /> directed by [[Louis Malle]] and starring [[Jeanne Moreau]]. Consisting of French jazz musicians [[Barney Wilen]], [[Pierre Michelot]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Urtreger]], and American drummer [[Kenny Clarke]], the group avoided a written score and instead improvised while they watched the film in a recording studio.\n\nAfter returning to New York, Davis revived his quintet with Adderley<ref name=\"New Grove\" /> and Coltrane, who was clean from his drug habit. Now a sextet, the group recorded material in early 1958 that was released on ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'', an album that demonstrated Davis's interest in [[modal jazz]]. A performance by [[Les Ballets Africains]] drew him to slower, deliberate music that allowed the creation of solos from harmony rather than chords.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=97}}\n\nBy May 1958, he had replaced Jones with drummer [[Jimmy Cobb]], and Garland left the group, leaving Davis to play piano on \"Sid's Ahead\" for ''Milestones''.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=224}} He wanted someone who could play modal jazz, so he hired [[Bill Evans]], a young pianist with a background in classical music.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=229}} Evans had an impressionistic approach to piano. His ideas greatly influenced Davis. But after eight months of touring, a tired Evans left. [[Wynton Kelly]], his replacement, brought to the group a swinging style that contrasted with Evans's delicacy. The sextet made their recording debut on ''[[Jazz Track]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=229}}\n\n===1957\u20131963: Collaborations with Gil Evans and ''Kind of Blue''===\nBy early 1957, Davis was exhausted from recording and touring and wished to pursue new projects.

Evans devised orchestral passages as transitions, thus turning the album into one long piece of music.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=141}}<ref>Cook, op. cit.</ref> ''[[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Porgy and Bess]]'' (1959) includes arrangements of pieces from George Gershwin's [[Porgy and Bess|opera]]. ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960) contained music by [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo]] and [[Manuel de Falla]] and originals by Evans. The classical musicians had trouble improvising, while the jazz musicians couldn't handle the difficult arrangements, but the album was a critical success, selling over 120,000 copies in the US.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=108}} Davis performed with an orchestra conducted by Evans at Carnegie Hall in May 1961 to raise money for charity.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=109}} The pair's final album was ''[[Quiet Nights (Miles Davis and Gil Evans album)|Quiet Nights]]'' (1963), a collection of [[bossa nova]] songs released against their wishes. Evans stated it was only half an album and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer [[Teo Macero]] and refused to speak to him for more than two years.{{sfn|Carr|1998|pp=192\u2013193}} The boxed set ''[[Miles Davis & Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings]]'' (1996) won the [[Grammy Award for Best Historical Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes|Best Album Notes]] in 1997.\n\nIn March and April 1959, Davis recorded what some consider his greatest album, ''[[Kind of Blue]]''. He named the album for its mood.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=106}} He called back Bill Evans, as the music had been planned around Evans's piano style.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} Both Davis and Evans were familiar with [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]'s ideas about modal jazz.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=74}} But Davis neglected to tell pianist Wynton Kelly that Evans was returning, so Kelly appeared on only one song, \"[[Freddie Freeloader]]\". {{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} The sextet had played \"[[So What (instrumental)|So What]]\" and \"[[All Blues]]\" at performances, but the remaining three compositions they saw for the first time in the studio.\n\nReleased in August 1959, ''Kind of Blue'' was an instant success, with widespread radio airplay and rave reviews from critics.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=106}} It has remained a strong seller over the years.

While touring Europe, the group made its first album, ''[[Miles in Berlin]]'' (1965).{{sfn|Einarson|2005|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n[[File:Miles-Davis-1964-Helsinki.jpg|thumb|right|Davis performing at [[T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Sports Hall]] (Messuhalli) in [[Helsinki]], Finland, in October 1964]]\nDavis needed medical attention for hip pain, which had worsened since his Japanese tour during the previous year.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=202}} He underwent hip replacement surgery in April 1965, with bone taken from his shin, but it failed.

The quintet's approach to the new music became known as \"time no changes\"\u2014which referred to Davis's decision to depart from chordal sequences and adopt a more open approach, with the rhythm section responding to the soloists' melodies.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=49}} Through ''Nefertiti'' the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of change. His bands performed this way until his hiatus in 1975.\n\n''Miles in the Sky'' and ''Filles de Kilimanjaro''\u2014which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks\u2014pointed the way to the [[jazz fusion|fusion]] phase of Davis's career. He also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of ''Filles de Kilimanjaro'' was recorded, bassist [[Dave Holland]] and pianist [[Chick Corea]] had replaced Carter and Hancock.
