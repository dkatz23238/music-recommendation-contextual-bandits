In 1993, they changed their name to [[Babble (band)|Babble]], to reflect their change in music from pop to [[Dub music|dub]]-influenced [[Chill-out music|chill-out]]. They continued as Babble until 1996, at which point the group permanently dissolved.\n\nThe band's name was based on the two bumbling detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] (who are not twins) in the English language version of [[Herg\u00e9]]'s comic strip ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> At various stages they had up to seven members, but their best-known incarnation was as a trio between 1982 and 1986. The band became a prominent act in the US during the [[Second British Invasion]], and in 1985 performed at [[Live Aid]] in [[Philadelphia]], where they were joined onstage by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Early days===\nIn 1977, the original Thompson Twins line-up consisted of [[Tom Bailey (musician)|Tom Bailey]] (born 18 January 1956, [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Yorkshire]])<ref>[http://www.spock.com/Tom-Bailey-(Thompson-Twins) ] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20090118005714/http://www.spock.com/Tom-Bailey-(Thompson-Twins) |date=18 January 2009}}</ref> on bass and vocals, Pete Dodd on guitar and vocals, John Roog on guitar, and Jon Podgorski (known as \"Pod\") on drums.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/thompson-twins-mn0000567570/biography |title=Thompson Twins &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> Dodd and Roog first met when they were both 13 years old.\n\nArriving in London with very little money, they lived as [[squatter]]s in Lillieshall Road, [[Clapham]]. Future Thompson Twins member [[Alannah Currie]] (born 20 September 1957, [[Auckland]], New Zealand) lived in another squat in the same street, which is how she met Bailey. In this house they found an illegal way of accessing electricity from the house next door. Bailey described them, laughingly, as having been \"spongers\" at the time, for they were living on very little money, and scavenging everything they could lay their hands on. He even said that the only instruments they had were bought, or had been stolen or borrowed. Dodd managed to get a [[council flat]] not far away. Their [[Road crew|roadie]] at that time was John Hade, who lived in the same house, and who later became their manager.\n\nAs Podgorski had decided to stay in the north, the group auditioned for drummers at the Point Studio in [[Victoria, London]]. [[Andrew Edge]] joined them on drums for 18 months, and went on to join [[Savage Progress]], who later toured with the Thompson Twins as the support act on the band's 1984 UK tour.\n\nIn 1980, the band (now consisting of Bailey, Dodd, Roog and drummer Chris Bell, who had replaced Edge the previous year) released their first single, \"Squares and Triangles\", on their own Dirty Discs label. A follow-up single, \"She's In Love With Mystery\", was issued later that year.\n\n===Line-up changes===\nIn 1981, the line-up became Bailey, Dodd, Roog, Bell and two new members: former band roadie [[Joe Leeway]] on congas and percussion, and Jane Shorter on saxophone. This line-up recorded the first Thompson Twins album ''[[A Product of ... (Participation)]]'', documented in the film ''Listen to London'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.listentolondon.net |title=The \"Lost\" Listen To London Documentary! \u2013 1981 Film about Post Punk Indy Rebellion in UK |website=Listentolondon.net |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> Currie, who had been associated with the band for a few years, played and sang on the first album, but was not yet a full member.\n\nAfter the first album, the band's line-up shifted yet again. Saxophonist Jane Shorter left and was replaced by Currie (who also played percussion), and bassist [[Matthew Seligman]], a former member of [[the Soft Boys]] and [[the Fallout Club]], joined;<ref name=\"AMG\"/> leaving Bailey to switch to keyboards, with Leeway starting to handle vocals on some tracks.\n\nThe band signed to [[Arista Records]] and released the album ''[[Set (Thompson Twins album)|Set]]''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> [[Thomas Dolby]] played some keyboards on ''Set'' and some live gigs, for Bailey at that time had little experience with synthesizers. ''Set'' contained the single \"[[In the Name of Love (Thompson Twins song)|In the Name of Love]]\", sung and largely written by Bailey. It became a No.&nbsp;1 dance club hit in the US,<ref name=\"Charts\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/thompson-twins-mn0000567570/awards |title=Thompson Twins &#124; Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> and an album entitled ''In the Name of Love'' (consisting mainly of tracks from ''Set'', with two others from ''A Product Of... (Participation)'') was released in the US to capitalize on the song's popularity. It entered the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=\"Charts\"/>\n\n===Trio===\nAfter the success of \"In the Name of Love\", Bailey, Currie and Leeway, wanting to pursue the single's different sound, toyed with the idea of starting a new band on the side, which they planned to call 'The Bermuda Triangle'.<ref name=\"Lost\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lostidols.com/files/t/twins.html |title=Lost Idols |website=Lostidols.com |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> When \"In The Name Of Love\" (and the parent album ''Set'') failed to make a substantial impact in the UK [[record chart]]s, this plan was abandoned. However, at the same time, manager Hade convinced Bailey, Leeway and Currie to downsize the Thompson Twins to a core of the three in April 1982.<ref name=\"Lost\"/> Accordingly, the other four members of the band were notified that the band was breaking up; they were each paid \u00a3500 and were allowed to keep their instruments and equipment in exchange for an understanding not to perform together under the name \"Thompson Twins\".\n\nThe remaining Thompson Twins, who had not in fact broken up, decided to go abroad to free themselves of any UK influence, as well as to combine the songwriting for their first album as a trio with a long holiday. They first went to [[Egypt]] and then to the [[Bahamas]], where they recorded at [[Compass Point Studios]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] with [[record producer|producer]] [[Alex Sadkin]].\n\nBailey commented on the band's reduction to a trio in a 1983 interview: \"When we reformed the band, we were making a statement. We weren't going to be a rock 'n' roll band, we weren't going to have a guitar. We were going to move on. You know, [[Lou Reed]] said whenever he played live he ended up going back to heroin music. There are old associations, associations we don't want because they don't reflect the way we feel today. ... Right now, technology is what's important, and that's what our music tries to reflect.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mehler |first=Mark |title=Either Get into Context or Butt Out of Life Altogether |journal=Record |date=June 1983 |volume=2 |issue=8 |page=6}}</ref>\n\n===International success===\nThe band broke into the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart at the beginning of 1983 with \"[[Lies (Thompson Twins song)|Lies]]\" and \"[[Love On Your Side (song)|Love On Your Side]]\", which became the band's first UK Top 10 single.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=David |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |location=London |edition=19th |year=2006 |page=557 |isbn=1-904994-10-5}}</ref><ref name=\"Charts\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Gary |title=British Chart Singles: Love On Your Side \u2013 Thompson Twins |url=http://britishchartsingles.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/love-on-your-side-thompson-twins.html |website=Britishchartsingles.blogspot.co.uk |date=6 March 2013 |access-date=17 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234447/http://britishchartsingles.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/love-on-your-side-thompson-twins.html |archive-date=18 April 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> They then released their third album, ''[[Quick Step & Side Kick]]'' (called simply ''Side Kicks'' in the US),<ref name=\"Charts\"/> which peaked at number 2 in the UK and was later certified platinum.

However, in March 1985, while promoting their new single \"[[Roll Over (Thompson Twins song)|Roll Over]]\" and the forthcoming album, Bailey collapsed in his London hotel room from [[nervous exhaustion]]. The \"Roll Over\" single was then cancelled at the last minute and the new album postponed. Though the band had chosen to produce themselves, the postponement caused them to rethink the project and producer [[Nile Rodgers]] was subsequently called in to rework the album with them. The album was eventually released in September 1985, reaching the UK Top 5 and US Top 20,<ref name=\"Charts\"/> though failed to come close to the success of ''Into The Gap''.

In 1991, Bailey and Currie were married in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], US and the following year moved to New Zealand. In 1992, the Thompson Twins contributed the song \"[[Play with Me (Jane)|Play with Me]]\" to the [[Songs from the Cool World|soundtrack]] of the [[Ralph Bakshi]] film ''[[Cool World]]''; Bailey alone contributed a second track, \"Industry and Seduction\". The following year, the duo teamed up with engineer Keith Fernley and changed their band name to [[Babble (band)|Babble]]. They released two albums, in 1993 and 1996.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nThe Thompson Twins declined to follow the example of many of their contemporaries and reform in order to tie in with a trend of nostalgia for the 1980s, although Bailey, Currie and Leeway appeared together on the UK [[Channel 4]] show ''Top Ten Electro Bands'' in 2001. The Thompson Twins were placed ninth.\n\n==After the Twins==\nBabble released two albums, ''[[The Stone (Babble album)|The Stone]]'' (1993)<ref name=\"AMG\"/> and ''[[Ether (Babble album)|Ether]]'' (1996), with songs featured in the films ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' and ''[[With Honors (film)|With Honors]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Currie gave up the music business to set up her own glass-casting studio in [[Auckland]] and concentrated on raising her two children. In 2001, she founded and ran the anti-GM group called MAdGE (Mothers Against Genetic Engineering in food and the environment), and networked thousands of women across New Zealand in a resistance movement, aimed at keeping the biotech industry from using New Zealand as an experimental playground.<ref name=\"TheAge\"/> Currie described this group as a \"rapidly growing network of politically non-aligned women who are actively resisting the use of genetically-engineered material in our food and on our land\".
