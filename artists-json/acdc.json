See WP:ENGVAR for more info.--> an Australian [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in 1973 by [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-born brothers [[Malcolm Young|Malcolm]] and [[Angus Young]].<ref name=\"MalcolmQuits\" /> Their music has been variously described as [[hard rock]], [[blues rock]], and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"McParland\" /> but the band calls it simply \"[[rock and roll]]\".<ref name=\"Bonfire\" />\n\nAC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, 1975's ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]''. Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers, singer [[Bon Scott]], drummer [[Phil Rudd]], and bassist [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]]. Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by [[Cliff Williams]], who has appeared on every AC/DC album since 1978's ''[[Powerage]]''. In February 1980, about seven months after the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', Scott died of acute [[alcohol poisoning]] after a night of heavy drinking.<ref name=\"BScottDeath\" /> AC/DC considered disbanding, but at Scott's family's request, the remaining members opted to continue the band, bringing in longtime [[Geordie (band)|Geordie]] vocalist [[Brian Johnson]] as Scott's replacement.<ref name=\"hell_aint\" /> Later that year, the band released their first album with Johnson, ''[[Back in Black]]'', which was dedicated to Scott's memory. The album launched AC/DC to new heights of success and became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best selling albums]] of all time.\n\nThe band's eighth studio album, ''[[For Those About to Rock We Salute You]]'' (1981), was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Prior to the release of their next album, ''[[Flick of the Switch]]'' (1983), Rudd left the band and was replaced by [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]], being in turn replaced by [[Chris Slade]] in 1989. The band experienced a commercial resurgence in the early nineties with the release of their twelfth studio album ''[[The Razors Edge (AC/DC album)|The Razors Edge]]'' (1990); it was their only album to feature Slade, who was replaced by the returning Rudd in 1994. Rudd has since recorded five more albums with the band, starting with, and including, ''[[Ballbreaker]]'' (1995). Their fifteenth studio album ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]'' was the second-highest-selling album of 2008, and their biggest chart hit since ''For Those About to Rock'', eventually reaching No.1 worldwide.<ref name=\"currentstatus\" />\n\nThe band's line-up remained the same for twenty years, until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset [[dementia]] (he died in 2017) and Rudd's legal troubles. Malcolm was replaced by his nephew [[Stevie Young]], who debuted on AC/DC's 2014 album ''[[Rock or Bust]]'', and on its [[Rock or Bust World Tour|accompanying tour]], previous drummer Chris Slade filled in for Rudd. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to worsening hearing loss. [[Guns N' Roses]] frontman [[Axl Rose]] stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player and background vocalist Cliff Williams retired from AC/DC at the end of the ''Rock or Bust'' tour in 2016 and the group entered a four-year hiatus. A reunion of the ''Rock or Bust'' lineup was announced in September 2020 and the band's seventeenth studio album ''[[Power Up (album)|Power Up]]'' was released two months later.\n\nAC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 75&nbsp;million albums in the United States, making them the [[list of highest-certified music artists in the United States|ninth-highest-selling artist in the United States]] and the [[list of best-selling music artists|16th-best-selling artist worldwide]].<ref name=\"riaa1\" /><ref name=\"4zmbT\" /><ref name=\"eIi4U\" /> ''Back in Black'' has sold an estimated 50&nbsp;million units worldwide, making it the [[List of best-selling albums|second-highest-selling album by any artist]], and the highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 25 million units in the US, where it is the fourth highest-selling album of all time.<ref name=\"riaa2\" /> AC/DC were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on 10 March 2003.<ref name=\"1zFIm\" /> AC/DC ranked fourth on ''[[VH1]]''{{'s}} list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\"<ref name=\"ncQS2\" /><ref name=\"K5xeE\" /> and were named the seventh \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\" by MTV.<ref name=\"eVbFY\" /> In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"]]. Producer [[Rick Rubin]], who wrote an essay on the band for the ''Rolling Stone'' list, referred to AC/DC as \"the greatest rock and roll band of all time\".<ref name=\"thegreatest\" /> In 2010, ''VH1'' ranked AC/DC number 23 in its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".<ref name=\"ODQCW\" />\n\n==History==\n===Formation and name (1973\u20131974)===\nIn November 1973, Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC with bassist [[Larry Van Kriedt]], vocalist [[Dave Evans (singer)|Dave Evans]], and ex-[[The Masters Apprentices|Masters Apprentices]] drummer [[Colin Burgess (musician)|Colin Burgess]].<ref name=\"5koQY\" /> [[Gene Pierson]] booked the band to play at Chequers nightclub on New Year's Eve, 1973.<ref name=\"longwaytimeline\" /> By this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: [[Spider-Man]], [[Zorro]], a gorilla, and a parody of [[Superman]], named Super-Ang.<ref name=\"cwalker\" /> In its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of [[Glam rock|glam]] or satin outfit. On stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first [[Talent manager|manager]], Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]]. In [[Paul Stenning]]'s book ''AC/DC: Two Sides To Every Glory'' it was stated that Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's bitter feeling toward Evans.<ref name=\"paulstenning\" />\n\n[[File:Logo ACDC.svg|thumb|The band's logo was designed in 1977 by [[Gerard Huerta]]. It first appeared on the international version of ''Let There Be Rock''.]]\nMalcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials \"AC/DC\" on the [[AC adapter]] of a sewing machine. \"AC/DC\" is an abbreviation meaning \"[[alternating current]]/[[direct current]]\" electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, power-driven performances of their music.<ref name=\"wbp4T\" /><ref name=\"acdc.cc\" /> \"AC/DC\" is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as \"Acca Dacca\" in Australia.<ref name=\"AwrS5\" /><ref name=\"kjABl\" /> The AC/DC band name is stylised with a [[high voltage]] sign separating the \"AC\" and \"DC\" and has been used on all studio albums, with the exception of the international version of ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]''.<ref name=\"coverart\" />\n\nBy the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation, which led to a support slot for the visiting [[Lou Reed]]. Sometime in 1974, on the recommendation of [[Michael Chugg]], veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club, the Hard Rock. He was not pleased with their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterward, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and [[Harry Vanda]].<ref name=\"Browning\" /> The Young brothers decided to abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end, they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group.<ref name=\"paulstenning\" /> Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.\n\n===Bon Scott era (1974\u20131980)===\n\n====Beginnings (1974\u20131976)====\nIn September 1974, [[Bon Scott]], an experienced vocalist from [[Fraternity (band)|Fraternity]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fraternity |url=https://fraternitybandofficial.com.au/ |access-date=2022-07-02 |website=Fraternity |language=en-AU}}</ref> and friend of George Young, replaced Dave Evans<ref name=\"Music Legends\" /> after friend [[Vince Lovegrove]] recommended him to George Young.<ref name=\"hell_aint\" /> Scott's appointment coincided with him working as a chauffeur for the band at the time until an audition promoted him to lead singer.<ref name=\"e9sQS\" /> Like the Young brothers, Scott was born in Scotland and emigrated to Australia in his childhood. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, \"[[Can I Sit Next to You, Girl]]\" / \"Rockin' in the Parlour\"; the song was re-written and re-recorded with Bon Scott.\n\n<!-- [[Bon Scott#With AC/DC]] links here -->\nBy October 1974, AC/DC had recorded their first studio album, ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]''. It was released exclusively in Australia on 17 February 1975, along with a single \"[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]\" / \"Love Song\". The album took only ten days<ref name=\"timeline\" /> and was based on instrumental songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]], and drummer [[Phil Rudd]]. Later that year they released the single \"[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)|It's a Long Way to the Top]]\", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', featuring the band miming the song on the back of a flatbed truck. AC/DC released their second studio album, ''[[T.N.T. (album)|T.N.T.]]'', on 1 December 1975, which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAC/DC were scheduled to play at the 1975 [[Sunbury music festival]]; however, they went home without performing following an altercation with the management and crew of headlining act [[Deep Purple]].<ref name=\"RrGtM\" />\n\nBetween 1974 and 1977, aided by regular appearances on [[Molly Meldrum]]'s ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s nationally broadcast pop-music television show, AC/DC became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia. Their performance on 3 April 1977 was their last live TV appearance for more than 20 years.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\n====Initial success, record deal (1976\u20131977)====\n[[File:ACDC-Hughes-long ago.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Former vocalist [[Bon Scott]] (centre) pictured with guitarist [[Angus Young]] (left) and bassist [[Cliff Williams]] (back), performing at the [[Ulster Hall]] in August 1979]]\nBrowning sent promo material to contacts in London, which came to the attention of [[Phil Carson]] of [[Atlantic Records]]. In 1976, the band signed an international deal with Atlantic Records. On arrival in London, their scheduled tour with [[Back Street Crawler (band)|Back Street Crawler]] was canceled following the death of [[Paul Kossoff]]. As a result, they went back to playing smaller venues to build a local following until their label organised the \"Lock Up Your Daughters\" tour sponsored by ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine, the only major music magazine which was still relatively receptive to traditional rock music. At the time, [[punk rock]] was breaking and came to dominate the pages of the major British music weeklies, ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Melody Maker]]''. AC/DC were sometimes identified with the [[punk rock]] movement by the British press, but the band hated punk rock, believing it to be a passing fad\u2014manager Michael Browning wrote that \"it wasn't possible to even hold a conversation with AC/DC about punk without them getting totally pissed off\".<ref name=\"Browning\" /> Their reputation managed to survive the punk upheavals and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time.<ref name=\"Bonfire\" /> Angus Young gained notoriety for [[mooning]] the audience during live performances.\n\nThe first AC/DC album to gain worldwide distribution was a 1976 compilation of tracks taken from the ''High Voltage'' and ''T.N.T.'' [[LP record|LPs]]. Also titled ''[[High Voltage (1976 album)|High Voltage]]'', and released on the Atlantic Records label, the album has to date sold three million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"BiBBillboard\" /><ref name=\"FI4Os\" /> The track selection was heavily weighted toward the more recent ''T.N.T.'', including only two songs from their first LP. The band's third studio album, ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'', was released in the same year in both Australian and international versions, like its predecessor. Track listings varied worldwide, and the international version of the album also featured the ''T.N.T.'' track \"Rocker\", which had previously not been released internationally. The original Australian version included \"[[Jailbreak (AC/DC song)|Jailbreak]]\" (now more readily available on the 1984 compilation [[Extended play|EP]] ''[['74 Jailbreak]]'' or as a live version on the 1992 ''[[Live (AC/DC album)|Live]]'' album). ''Dirty Deeds'' was not released in the US until 1981, by which time the band were at the peak of their popularity.\n\nAfter a brief tour of Sweden, they returned to London where they set new attendance records during their residency at the [[Marquee Club|Marquee]]. However, their appearance at the 1976 [[Reading Festival]] failed to get a response from the crowd. They toured extensively throughout Europe, then returned to tour Australia in late 1976 to rebuild their finances and record their fourth studio album, ''[[Let There Be Rock]]''.\n\nIn early 1977, they returned to Britain and began a European tour with [[Black Sabbath]]. While Bon Scott and [[Ozzy Osbourne]] quickly became friends, relations were less than cordial between the other members of the respective bands. In one incident, [[Geezer Butler]] pulled a \"knife\" on Malcolm Young, though it was a \"silly\" flick-knife comb.<ref name=\"NDxLw\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/let-there-be-rock-the-album-that-nearly-killed-ac-dc |title=Let There Be Rock: The album that saved AC/DC's career |last=Wall |first=Mick |date=7 May 2016 |website=Classic Rock |access-date=23 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024073817/https://www.loudersound.com/features/let-there-be-rock-the-album-that-nearly-killed-ac-dc |archive-date=24 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Later in the year they toured with [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]].\n\n====Cliff Williams joins, death of Bon Scott (1977\u20131980)====\nTowards the end of 1977, bassist Mark Evans was dismissed. Evans described disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor. He was replaced by [[Cliff Williams]], an experienced bass player who had played with several UK bands since the late 60s.<ref name=\"hell_aint\" /> Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of [[Epic Records]] and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, \"You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much of a nice guy.\"<ref name=\"cwalker\" /> Mark Evans' autobiography, ''Dirty Deeds: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC'', released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.<ref name=\"BazillionPoints\" />\n[[File:BonScottStatue3 gobeirne.jpg|left|thumb|Bronze statue of Bon Scott, unveiled in [[Fremantle]], Western Australia, in October 2008]]\n\nAC/DC's first American radio exposure was through Bill Bartlett at Jacksonville station WPDQ/WAIV in 1975,<ref>Fink, Jesse, ''The Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC'', Ebury Press, 2013, pp. 107\u2013111</ref> two years before they played their first US concert as support band for Canadian group [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]] in Austin, Texas, on 27 July 1977.<ref>Fink, Jesse, ''Bon: The Last Highway'', Ebury Press, 2017, p. 29</ref> Under the guidance of booking agent Doug Thaler of American Talent International and later the management of Leber-Krebs, they gained invaluable experience of the US stadium circuit, supporting leading rock acts such as [[Ted Nugent]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], and co-headlined with bands such as [[Cheap Trick]].\n\nAC/DC released their fifth studio album, ''[[Powerage]]'', on 5 May 1978, and with its harder [[riffs]], followed the blueprint set by ''Let There Be Rock''.<ref name=\"fuEcH\" /> Only one single was released from ''Powerage'', \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Damnation]]/Sin City\". An appearance at the [[The Apollo (Glasgow)|Apollo Theatre, Glasgow]] during the ''Powerage'' tour was recorded and released as ''[[If You Want Blood You've Got It]]''.\n\nThe major breakthrough in the band's career came in their collaboration with producer [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange|\"Mutt\" Lange]] on the band's sixth studio album ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', released in 1979. [[Eddie Van Halen]] notes this to be his favourite AC/DC record, along with ''Powerage''.<ref name=\"6PgJE\" /> It became the first AC/DC LP to break into the US top 100, eventually reaching No.&nbsp;17,<ref name=\"timeline\" /> and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts.<ref name=\"Bonfire\" /> ''Highway to Hell'' had lyrics that shifted away from flippant and comical toward more central rock themes, putting increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats.<ref name=\"slL1m\" />\n\nIn 1980, the band began to work on their seventh studio album ''[[Back in Black]]'' before tragedy struck. On 19 February 1980, Scott purportedly passed out in the car on the way back to the apartment of an acquaintance called Alistair Kinnear after a night of drinking and alleged drug-taking at The Music Machine in Camden, London. According to Kinnear, upon arrival at his home, he was unable to move Scott from the car into his home for the night, so he left him in the car overnight to sleep off the effects of the alcohol. Unable to wake Scott early on the evening of 20 February 1980, Kinnear rushed him to [[King's College Hospital]] in Camberwell, where Scott was pronounced dead on arrival. [[Pulmonary aspiration]] of vomit was cited as the cause of Scott's death, and the official cause was listed as \"[[alcohol poisoning|acute alcohol poisoning]]\".<ref name=\"BScottDeath\" /> Scott's family buried him in [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], the area they emigrated to when he was a boy.<ref name=\"K4EE6\" />\n\n===Brian Johnson era (1980\u2013present)===\n====Rebirth (1980\u20131983)====\n[[File:Brian Johnson.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Brian Johnson live with AC/DC in 2008]]\nFollowing Scott's death, the band briefly considered quitting, but encouraged by the insistence from Scott's parents that he would have wanted them to carry on, they decided to continue, and went about finding a new vocalist.<ref name=\"hell_aint\" /> Allan Fryer of [[Heaven (Australian band)|Fat Lip]], ex-[[Rick Wakeman]] vocalist [[Gary Pickford-Hopkins]],<ref>{{Cite book |title=AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll |last1=Engleheart |first1=Murray |last2=Durieux |first2=Arnaud |publisher=Harper Entertainment |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-113391-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/318 318] |url=https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/318}}</ref> and [[the Easybeats]]' singer [[Stevie Wright (Australian singer)|Stevie Wright]] were touted by the press as possible replacements.<ref>{{Cite book|title=AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll|last1=Engleheart|first1=Murray|last2=Durieux|first2=Arnaud|publisher=Harper Entertainment|year=2008|isbn=978-0-06-113391-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/308 308]|url=https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/308}}</ref> Various other candidates were also considered, including ex-[[Moxy (band)|Moxy]] member [[Buzz Shearman]], who was not able to join because of voice issues,<ref name=\"HB1l4\" /> [[Slade]] vocalist [[Noddy Holder]],<ref name=\"YjBlL\" /> and ex-[[Back Street Crawler (band)|Back Street Crawler]] vocalist [[Terry Slesser]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC |last=Fink |first=Jesse |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2014 |isbn=9781250053831 |pages=211\u2013212}}</ref>\n\nAt the advice of Lange, the group brought in ex-[[Geordie (band)|Geordie]] singer Brian Johnson, who impressed the group.<ref>{{Cite book |title=AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll |last1=Engleheart |first1=Murray |last2=Durieux |first2=Arnaud |publisher=Harper Entertainment |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-113391-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/309 309] |url=https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/309}}</ref> For the audition, Johnson sang \"[[Whole Lotta Rosie]]\" from ''[[Let There Be Rock]]'' and [[Ike & Tina Turner]]'s \"[[Nutbush City Limits]]\".<ref name=\"acdc.cc\" /> After the band begrudgingly worked through the rest of the list of applicants in the following days, Johnson returned for a second rehearsal.<ref>{{Cite book |title=AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll |last1=Engleheart |first1=Murray |last2=Durieux |first2=Arnaud |publisher=Harper Entertainment |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-113391-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/317 317\u2013318] |url=https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/317}}</ref>\n\nAngus Young later recalled, \"I remember the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of [[Little Richard]].' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him.\"<ref name=\"rKfEU\" />\n[[File:Cliffwilliams.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Cliff Williams]] in 1981]]\n\nOn 29 March, Malcolm Young called the singer to offer him a place in the band, much to Johnson's surprise. Out of respect for Bon Scott, the band wanted a vocalist who would not be a mere imitator of him. In addition to his distinctive voice, demeanor and love of classic soul and blues music, the group was impressed by Johnson's engaging personality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll |last1=Engleheart |first1=Murray |last2=Durieux |first2=Arnaud |publisher=Harper Entertainment |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-113391-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/319 319\u2013320] |url=https://archive.org/details/acdcmaximumrockr00murr/page/319}}</ref> Johnson was officially announced as the new lead singer of AC/DC on 1 April 1980.\n\nWith Johnson as the new vocalist, the band completed the songwriting that they had begun with Scott for the album ''[[Back in Black]]''. Recording took place at [[Compass Point Studios]] in The Bahamas a few months after Scott's death. ''Back in Black'', produced by [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange|Mutt Lange]] and recorded by [[Tony Platt]], became their biggest-selling album and a hard-rock landmark; hits include \"[[Hells Bells (song)|Hells Bells]]\", \"[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]\", \"[[Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution]]\" and [[Back in Black (song)|the title track]]. The album reached No.1 in the UK and No.4 in the US, where it spent 131 weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nThe band's eighth studio album, ''[[For Those About to Rock We Salute You]]'', was released in 1981, also sold well and was positively received by critics. The album featured two of the band's most popular singles: \"Let's Get It Up\"<ref name=\"everyhit\" /> and the title track, \"[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)|For Those About to Rock]]\", which reached No.13 and No.15 in the UK, respectively.\n\n====Lineup changes and commercial decline (1983\u20131989)====\nThe band parted ways with producer Mutt Lange for their ninth studio album, ''[[Flick of the Switch]]'', released in 1983, in an effort to recover the rawness and simplicity of their early albums, but it was considered underdeveloped and unmemorable;<ref name=\"flickof\" /> one critic stated that the band \"had made the same album nine times\".<ref name=\"JTHjd\" /> AC/DC were voted the eighth-biggest disappointment of the year in the 1984 ''[[Kerrang!]]'' readers' poll.

Wilson]] was drafted in to help complete the recordings, but his drum parts were eventually not used, as Rudd had already completed the drum parts.<ref name=\"isY3U\" /> Rudd was replaced by [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]] in the summer of 1983 after the band held over 700 auditions in the US and UK.<ref name=\"t6Quh\" /> [[Simon Kirke]] of [[Free (band)|Free]] and [[Bad Company]] fame, and [[Paul Thompson (musician)|Paul Thompson]] of [[Roxy Music]] were two of the drummers auditioned.<ref name=\"Maximum\" />\n\nThe band's tenth studio album, ''[[Fly on the Wall (AC/DC album)|Fly on the Wall]]'', produced by the Young brothers in 1985, was also regarded as uninspired and directionless.<ref name=\"AqoRk\" /> A music concept video of [[Fly on the Wall (video)|the same name]] featured the band at a bar, playing five of the album's ten songs.\n\nIn 1986, the group returned to the charts with the made-for-radio \"[[Who Made Who (song)|Who Made Who]]\". The album ''[[Who Made Who]]'' was the soundtrack to [[Stephen King]]'s film ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'';<ref name=\"popmatters\" /> it brought together older hits, such as \"[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]\", with newer songs such as title track and two new instrumentals, \"D.T.\" and \"Chase the Ace\".\n\nIn February 1988, AC/DC were inducted into the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]]'s [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"6uflt\" /> AC/DC's eleventh studio album, ''[[Blow Up Your Video]]'', released in 1988, was recorded at [[Studio Miraval]] in [[Le Val, Var|Le Val]], France, and reunited the band with their original producers, [[Harry Vanda]] and [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]]. The group recorded nineteen songs, choosing ten for the final release; though the album was later criticised for containing excessive \"[[filler (media)|filler]]\",<ref name=\"blowup\" /> it was a commercial success. ''Blow Up Your Video'' sold more copies than the previous two studio releases combined, reaching No. 2 on the UK charts\u2014AC/DC's highest position since \"Back in Black\" in 1980. The album featured the UK top-twenty single \"[[Heatseeker (song)|Heatseeker]]\"<ref name=\"everyhit\" /> and popular songs such as \"[[That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll]]\". The ''Blow Up Your Video'' World Tour began in February 1988, in [[Perth]], Australia. That April, following live appearances across Europe, [[Malcolm Young]] announced that he was taking time off from touring, principally to begin recovery from his alcoholism. Another member of the Young family, [[Stevie Young]], temporarily took Malcolm's place.\n\nIn 1989, Wright left the group to work on the upcoming [[Dio (band)|Dio]] album ''[[Lock Up the Wolves]]'', and was replaced by session veteran [[Chris Slade]]. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce,<ref name=\"acdc.cc\" /> so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through ''[[Rock or Bust]]'' in 2014.\n\n====Popularity regained (1990\u20131998)====\n[[File:Ac-dcphil-rudd.jpg|thumb|[[Phil Rudd]] performs at the [[KeyArena]] in Seattle on 12 August 1996]]\nThe band's twelfth studio album, ''[[The Razors Edge (AC/DC album)|The Razors Edge]]'', was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by [[Mike Fraser (record producer)|Mike Fraser]] and produced by [[Bruce Fairbairn]], who had previously worked with [[Aerosmith]] and [[Bon Jovi]]. Released in 1990, it was a major success for the band, and included the hits \"[[Thunderstruck (song)|Thunderstruck]]\" and \"[[Are You Ready (AC/DC song)|Are You Ready]]\", which reached No. 5 and No. 16 respectively on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] Chart, and \"[[Moneytalks]]\", which peaked at No. 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"everyhit\" /> The album went [[multi-platinum]] and reached the US top ten. In September 1991, 1.6&nbsp;million people attended the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in [[Moscow]] to enjoy the first open-air rock concert to be held in the former [[Soviet Union]]. The show, also featuring [[Pantera]], [[The Black Crowes]] and [[Metallica]], had one of the largest attendances ever for a musical event.<ref>{{cite news |title=List of the most crowded music concerts in history |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/list-of-the-most-crowded-music-concerts-in-history/articleshow/49702777.cms?from=mdr |work=The Economic Times |date=8 November 2015 |access-date=22 May 2020 |archive-date=11 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111231049/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/list-of-the-most-crowded-music-concerts-in-history/articleshow/49702777.cms?from=mdr |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSeveral shows on the Razors Edge tour were recorded for the 1992 live album, titled ''[[Live (AC/DC album)|Live]]''.

During ''The Razors Edge'' tour, three fans were killed at a concert at the [[Salt Palace (arena)|Salt Palace]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] in January 1991: when the concert began fans rushed the stage crushing the three and injuring others. It took 20 minutes before venue security and the group understood the severity of the situation and halted the concert. AC/DC settled with the victims' families out of court. As a result of this incident, the Salt Palace eliminated [[festival seating]] from future events.<ref name=\"ibYKb\" /><ref name=\"knYih\" />\n\nIn 1993, AC/DC recorded \"[[Big Gun]]\" for the soundtrack of the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] movie ''[[Last Action Hero]]''.

He was eventually rehired to replace Slade, whose departure arose in part because of the band's strong desire to again work with Rudd. Recorded at the [[Ocean Way Recording|Ocean Way Studios]] in Los Angeles by the reunited 1980\u201383 line-up and produced by Rick Rubin, the band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Ballbreaker]]'' was released in 1995. The first single from the album was \"[[Hard as a Rock]]\". Two more singles were released from the album: \"[[Hail Caesar (song)|Hail Caesar]]\" and \"[[Cover You in Oil]]\".\n\nIn 1997, a box set named ''[[Bonfire (album)|Bonfire]]'' was released.

''Live from the Atlantic Studios'' was recorded on 7 December 1977 at the Atlantic Studios in New York. ''Let There Be Rock: The Movie'' was a double album recorded in 1979 at the [[Pavillon de Paris]] and was the soundtrack of a motion picture, ''[[AC/DC: Let There Be Rock]]''.

Their music\u2014loud, hard, and guitar driven\u2014may best be described as hard rock. However, there are people who will say that they are indisputably metal. Therein lies the ongoing problem of categorisation. While AC/DC has referenced the underworld and they have given their listeners 'Highway to Hell' and 'Hell's Bells,' their songs are constructed on straightforward major and minor power chords. They are not modally developed as are a good deal of heavy metal compositions. Their sound is loud and crisp, not muddy or down-tuned.<ref name=\"McParland\" />}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' music journalist David Marchese, the instrumental foundation of the band's simple sound was the drummer\u2014Rudd, Wright, or Slade\u2014striking the [[kick drum]] on the first and third [[beat (music)|beat]] of every [[measure (music)|measure]], and the [[snare drum]] on the second and fourth beat; bassist Williams consistently [[downpicking]] an [[eighth note]]; Angus Young performing lead parts that possessed \"a clear architecture and even sort of swing, in a frenzied, half-demented way\"; and Malcolm Young's \"propulsive\" yet nuanced rhythm guitar featuring \"little ''chuks'', stutters, and silences that give the monstrous riffs life\".<ref name=\"Marchese\" /> For the majority of Malcolm Young's tenure in AC/DC, he used a Marshall Super Bass head to amplify his rhythm guitar while recording in the studio. According to Chris Gill of ''[[Guitar World]]'', the amplifier helped define his signature guitar tone: \"clean but as loud as possible to ride on the razor's edge of power amp distortion and deliver the ideal combination of grind, twang, clang and crunch, with no distorted preamp 'hair,' fizz or compression\", as heard on songs such as \"Let There Be Rock\", \"Dirty Deeds\", \"For Those About to Rock\", and \"Thunderstruck\". During 1978 to 1980, however, Young used a Marshall 2203 100-watt master volume head, which Gill speculates may have contributed to a \"slightly more distorted and dark\" guitar tone on the albums from that period, including ''Powerage'' and ''Back in Black''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Gill|first=Chris|date=2 January 2018|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/acdc-thunderstruck-secrets-behind-malcolm-young-guitar-sound-tonal-recall|title=The Secrets Behind Malcolm Young's Guitar Sound on AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck'|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|access-date=9 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810072525/https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/acdc-thunderstruck-secrets-behind-malcolm-young-guitar-sound-tonal-recall|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the recording of ''Back in Black'' in 1980, rock journalist Joe S. Harrington believed the band had departed further from the blues-oriented rock of their previous albums, and toward a more dynamic attack that adopted punk rock's \"high-energy implications\" and transmuted their hard rock/heavy metal songs into \"more pop-oriented blasts\". The band would remain faithful for the remainder of their career, to this \"impeccably ham-handed\" musical style: \"the guitars were compacted into a singular statement of rhythmic efficiency, the rhythm section provided the thunderhorse overdrive, and vocalist Johnson belowed and brayed like the most unhinged practitioner of bluesy top-man dynamics since vintage [[Robert Plant]].\"<ref>{{cite book|pages=81\u201382|last=Harrington|first=Joe S.|chapter=Back in Black|editor-last=Hoye|editor-first=Jacob|title=VH-1's 100 Greatest Albums|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=2003|isbn=0743448766}}</ref>\n\nIn a comparison of AC/DC's vocalists, [[Robert Christgau]] said Bon Scott exhibited a \"blokelike croak\" and \"charm\", often singing about sexual aggression in the guise of fun: \"Like [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]] or [[Roger Chapman]] though without their panache, he has fun being a dirty young man\". Johnson, in his opinion, possessed \"three times the range and wattage\" as a vocalist while projecting the character of a \"[[bloke]] as fantasy-fiction demigod\". By the time Johnson had fully acclimated himself with 1981's ''For Those About to Rock We Salute You'', Christgau said he defined \"an anthemic grandiosity more suitable to [the band's] precious-metal status than Bon Scott's old-fashioned raunch\", albeit in a less intelligent manner.<ref name=\"Christgau90\" />\n\n==Criticism==\nThroughout the band's career, their songs have been criticised as simplistic, monotonous, deliberately lowbrow, and sexist. David Marchese from ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' wrote that, \"regardless of the lyricist, whether it was Scott (who was capable of real wit and colour), Johnson, or the Young brothers, there's a deep strain of misogyny in the band's output that veers from feeling terribly dated to straight-up reprehensible.\"<ref name=\"Marchese\" /> According to Christgau in 1988, \"the brutal truth is that sexism has never kept a great rock-and-roller down\u2014from [[Muddy Waters|Muddy]] to [[Lemmy]], lots of dynamite music has objectified women in objectionable ways. But rotely is not among those ways\", in regards to AC/DC.<ref name=\"Christgau90\" /> Fans of the band have defended their music by highlighting its \"bawdy humour\",<ref name=\"Sturges\" /> while members of the group have generally been dismissive of claims that their songs are sexist, arguing that they are meant to be in jest.<ref name=\"Marchese\" /> In an interview with [[Sylvie Simmons]] for ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', Angus called the band \"pranksters more than anything else\", while Malcolm said \"we're not like some macho band. We take the music far more seriously than we take the lyrics, which are just throwaway lines.\"<ref name=\"Sturges\" /> Marchese regarded the musical aspect of the Youngs' songs \"strong enough to render the words a functional afterthought\", as well as \"deceptively plain, devastatingly effective, and extremely lucrative\".<ref name=\"Marchese\" />\n\nFor the book ''Under My Thumb: Songs That Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them'', ''[[The Guardian]]'' arts critic Fiona Sturges contributed an essay evaluating her love for AC/DC. While acknowledging she is a feminist, and that the band's music is problematic for her, she believed it would be \"daft, as opposed to damaging\", for female listeners if they can understand the band to be \"a bunch of archly sex-obsessed idiots with sharp tunes and some seriously killer riffs\". In spite of the \"unpleasant sneering quality\" of \"Carry Me Home\"{{'}}s claims about a woman who \"ain't no lady\", the \"rape fantasy\" of \"Let Me Put My Love into You\", and the generally one-dimensional portrayals of women, Sturges said songs such as \"Whole Lotta Rosie\" and \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" demonstrated that the female characters \"are also having a good time and are, more often than not, in the driving seat in sexual terms... it's the men who come over as passive and hopeless, awestruck in the presence of sexual partners more experienced and adept than them.\"<ref name=\"Sturges\" />\n\nAs with many bands of their era, AC/DC ran afoul of the [[Satanic ritual abuse|Satanic panic]] of the 1980s. This general fear of modern hard rock and heavy metal was greatly increased in the band's case when serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]] was arrested. Ramirez, nicknamed the \"Night Stalker\" by the press, told police that \"[[Night Prowler (song)|Night Prowler]]\" from the 1979 ''[[Highway to Hell]]'' album had driven him to commit murder. Police also claimed that Ramirez was wearing an AC/DC shirt and left an AC/DC hat at one of the crime scenes. Accusations that AC/DC were devil worshippers were made, the lyrics of \"Night Prowler\" were analysed, and some newspapers attempted to link Ramirez's Satanism with AC/DC's name, arriving at the conclusion that AC/DC actually stood for Anti-Christ/Devil's Child (or Devil's Children).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/08/31/Police-Saturday-arrested-the-alleged-Night-Stalker-accused-of/5705494308800/|title=Police Saturday arrested the alleged Night Stalker, accused of...|last=Snyder|first=Russell|date=31 August 1985|website=UPI|access-date=29 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029232411/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/08/31/Police-Saturday-arrested-the-alleged-Night-Stalker-accused-of/5705494308800/|archive-date=29 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-02/news/mn-22957_1_satanic-ritual|title=Other Serial Slayings Tinged by Satanism: Elements of Devil Worship in Stalker Case May Not Be Factors in Motivation, Experts Caution|last=Baker|first=Bob|date=2 September 1985|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=29 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124175840/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-02/news/mn-22957_1_satanic-ritual|archive-date=24 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/09/02/Heavy-metal-satanism-and-the-Night-Stalker/3569494481600/|title=Heavy metal, satanism and the Night Stalker|date=2 September 1985|website=UPI|access-date=29 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029232357/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/09/02/Heavy-metal-satanism-and-the-Night-Stalker/3569494481600/|archive-date=29 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-08/entertainment/ca-2746_1_heavy-metal|title=The Devil, You Say?

In 2007, critics noted that AC/DC, along with [[Thin Lizzy]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], and [[Judas Priest]], were among \"the second generation of rising stars ready to step into the breach as the old guard waned.\"<ref name=\"ZiNzy\" />\n\nAC/DC were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on 10 March 2003.<ref name=\"1zFIm\" /> During the ceremony the band performed \"[[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway to Hell]]\" and \"[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]\", with guest vocals provided by host [[Steven Tyler]] of [[Aerosmith]]. He described the band's [[power chord]]s as \"the thunder from down under that gives you the second most powerful surge that can flow through your body.\"<ref name=\"DCiA3\" /> During the acceptance speech, [[Brian Johnson]] quoted their 1977 song \"[[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]\".<ref name=\"gZ0YU\" />\n\nOn 22 March 2000, the municipality of [[Legan\u00e9s]] (near [[Madrid]]) named a street in honour of the band as \"Calle de AC/DC\" (\"AC/DC Street\"). Malcolm and Angus attended the inauguration with many fans. Later that day, the plaque with the name of the group was stolen, perhaps by an enthusiast or collector. The plaque was replaced two hours later, and stolen once again a mere three days after the fact.
