The first lineup of the band also included guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This lineup released two albums, ''[[Saturate (Breaking Benjamin album)|Saturate]]'' (2002) and ''[[We Are Not Alone (Breaking Benjamin album)|We Are Not Alone]]'' (2004), before Hummel was replaced by [[Chad Szeliga]] in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, ''[[Phobia (Breaking Benjamin album)|Phobia]]'' (2006) and ''[[Dear Agony]]'' (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/breaking-benjamin-battle-mystery-illness-on-painful-road-to-number-one-40812/|title = Breaking Benjamin Frontman Pushes Through Pain to Number One| magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date = July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAmid the hiatus, the release of a compilation album, ''[[Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin]]'' (2011), unauthorized by Burnley, brought about legal trouble within the band resulting in the dismissal of Fink and Klepaski. Szeliga later announced his departure in 2013 citing creative differences. Burnley remained the sole member of the band until late 2014, when the current lineup was announced, including bassist and backing vocalist Aaron Bruch, guitarist and backing vocalist [[Keith Wallen]], guitarist [[Jasen Rauch]], and drummer Shaun Foist. The band afterward released ''[[Dark Before Dawn]]'' (2015) and ''[[Ember (album)|Ember]]'' (2018), which debuted at number one and three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], respectively.<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122234917/https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-chart-topping-rock-band-youve-never-heard-of-11579528801 |last1=Kornelis |first1=Chris |title=The Chart-Topping Rock Band You've Never Heard Of |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-chart-topping-rock-band-youve-never-heard-of-11579528801 |access-date=January 23, 2020 |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 20, 2020 |archive-date=January 22, 2020 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref> Following these albums, the band released another compilation, ''[[Aurora (Breaking Benjamin album)|Aurora]]'' (2020), featuring reworked acoustic versions of past songs along with one original new song.\n\nDespite significant lineup changes, the band's musical style and lyrical content have remained consistent, with Burnley serving as the primary composer and lead vocalist since the band's inception. The band has commonly been noted for its formulaic [[hard rock]] tendencies with angst-heavy lyrics, swelling choruses, and \"crunching\" guitars. In the United States alone, the band has sold more than 7 million units{{sfn|Monacelli|2015}} and yielded three [[RIAA certification#Records|RIAA-certified]] platinum records, two gold records, and several certified singles, including two multi-platinum, two platinum, and five gold. The band has also produced one number one record on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''Saturate'' (1998\u20132003)===\nBenjamin Burnley was originally in a band named Breaking Benjamin in 1998, that played \"softer music\", such as [[Weezer]] and [[The Beatles]] covers, and was \"nothing like\" subsequent lineups.{{sfn|Book|2015}} The name originates from an incident in which Burnley broke a borrowed microphone, prompting its owner to retort, \"Thanks to Benjamin for breaking my fucking mic.\"{{sfn|Craft|2015}} This band included guitarist Aaron Fink, bassist Nick Hoover, and drummer Chris Lightcap, but soon broke up when Burnley moved to California.{{sfn|Sisak|2011}} After returning to Pennsylvania with drummer Jeremy Hummel, Burnley formed Plan 9, which also included bassist Jason Davoli. Plan 9, a reference to ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', was continually misnamed as \"Planet 9\". Therefore, the group reclaimed the name Breaking Benjamin from the previous band, as Burnley still had promotional stickers with that name.{{sfn|Book|2015}}\n\n{{Listen\n|pos=left\n|filename=Breaking Benjamin - Polyamorous (EP) (preview).ogg\n|title=\"Polyamorous\" (EP version)\n|description=Sample of the EP version of \"Polyamorous\", as first heard on Fabbri's radio station in 2001.\n|format=[[Ogg]]\n}}The three-piece first gained attention when Freddie Fabbri, a DJ for [[active rock]] radio station [[WBSX]], put the group's track \"[[Polyamorous (song)|Polyamorous]]\" in [[rotation (music)|rotation]].{{sfn|Duff|2002}} After it became the number one requested track on the station,{{sfn|Duff|2002}} Fabbri financed the recording of the group's [[Breaking Benjamin (EP)|eponymous EP]], which sold all 2,000 copies that were printed in 2001.{{sfn|Henderson|n.d}} Jonathan \"Bug\" Price was credited on bass, replacing Davoli.{{sfn|Breaking Benjamin|2001}} After growing dissatisfied with their previous band, former bandmate Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski joined Breaking Benjamin.{{sfn|St. James|2003}} In early 2002, over a dozen record companies visited a two-night showcase where Breaking Benjamin was playing, and the group subsequently signed with Hollywood Records.{{sfn|Duff|2002}} Shortly afterward, Breaking Benjamin began recording their first full-length major-label record, ''[[Saturate (Breaking Benjamin album)|Saturate]]'', which was released on August 7, 2002, and produced by [[Ulrich Wild]].{{sfn|Henderson|n.d}} It peaked at No. 136 on the ''Billboard'' 200,{{sfn|Billboard 200}} and was later certified gold on September 25, 2015.{{sfn|RIAA}} In early 2003, Breaking Benjamin participated in the [[J\u00e4germeister Music Tour]],{{sfn|Zeiler|2003}} then toured as a supporting act for [[Godsmack]].{{sfn|MTV News|2003}}\n\nOut of the little media coverage received, ''Saturate'' garnered positive reception, with Jason Taylor from [[AllMusic]] stating that the album \"has serious potential to become one of 2002's most successful debuts,\" feeling that \"although it is repetitive and generic, it is undeniably addictive\", ultimately scoring the album 2.5 out of 5.{{sfn|Taylor|2002}} The disc received a favorable review from Schwegweb's Vin Cherubino, who noted, \"The music has just as much quality as any popular artist in the same genre. Influences from bands such as [[Tool (band)|Tool]] can be heard, making the music seem all so familiar and palatable.\"{{sfn|Cherubino|2002}}\n\n===''We Are Not Alone'' (2003\u20132005)===\nBreaking Benjamin returned to the studio in October 2003 with producer [[David Bendeth]] for their second album ''[[We Are Not Alone (Breaking Benjamin album)|We Are Not Alone]]''.{{sfn|Loftus|2004a}} Burnley also worked with [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] front man [[Billy Corgan]] over the course of six days in December 2003 to write the songs \"Rain\", \"Forget It\", and \"Follow\".{{sfn|Wiederhorn|2004}} Despite initially being nervous, Burnley felt it was one of the highlights of his career.{{sfn|Wiederhorn|2004}}\n\n[[File:Breaking Benjamin 8-25-2005.jpg|thumb|Breaking Benjamin performing at the [[Minnesota State Fair]] on August 25, 2005]]\nThe album was released on June 29, 2004,{{sfn|Loftus|2004a}} and sold 48,000 copies in its first week,{{sfn|Billboard|2004|p=49}} peaking at No. 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200.{{sfn|Billboard 200}} It was later certified gold on October 21, 2004, then platinum on June 13, 2005.{{sfn|RIAA}} It was also certified gold in [[New Zealand]] on August 29, 2005.{{sfn|RIANZ}} The record features singles such as \"[[So Cold (Breaking Benjamin song)|So Cold]]\" and \"[[Sooner or Later (Breaking Benjamin song)|Sooner or Later]]\", both of which peaked at No. 2 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Songs]] chart.{{sfn|Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs|pp=1\u20132}} \"So Cold\" became a platinum single on September 25, 2015.{{sfn|RIAA}} [[MTV]] writer Jon Wiederhorn writes that the initial commercial success of the album can be attributed to a tour two weeks prior to the album's debut which \"generated prerelease buzz\".{{sfn|Wiederhorn|2004}} They later co-headlined a tour with [[Evanescence]], [[Seether]], and [[Three Days Grace]].{{sfn|Moss|2004}}\n\n''We Are Not Alone'' garnered mixed reviews. It was met with high acclaim from ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Colin Moriarty, who felt \"extremely satisfied,\" saying \"safely and confidently\" that it \"might be my personal favorite album of the year,\" giving it a score of 9.3 out of 10.{{sfn|Moriarty|2004}} Conversely, ''[[Exclaim!]]'' writer Amber Authier felt that, \"On first listen its simply generic sound did nothing for me,\" though later admitted, \"I listened to Breaking Benjamin several times over a week and several elements of the disc started to grow on me, even appeal to me.\" The writer concluded, \"Breaking Benjamin created a standard of quality for themselves that they simply couldn't meet on the entire disc.\"{{sfn|Authier|2004}}\n\nOn November 3, 2004, a non-album single named \"[[Blow Me Away]]\" was released, to commercial success, ultimately going gold on November 24, 2015.{{sfn|RIAA}} On November 23, 2004, Breaking Benjamin released the [[So Cold (Breaking Benjamin song)|''So Cold'' EP]], which features live versions of the songs \"Away\" and \"Breakdown\", a live acoustic version of \"So Cold\", and studio acoustic recordings of \"Blow Me Away\" and \"Lady Bug\".{{sfn|Loftus|2004b}}\n\nIn late 2005, drummer Hummel filed a federal lawsuit against Breaking Benjamin. According to the lawsuit, Hummel requested earlier that year to take a [[Parental leave|paternity leave]] to be with his wife during the birth of their first child, to which all members of the band agreed and hired Kevin Soffera as a temporary substitute on drums. However, Burnley later called Hummel and terminated him, citing [[Interpersonal attraction|chemistry issues]]. In the lawsuit, Hummel contended wrongful termination and lack of compensation for profits accrued by ''We Are Not Alone'' and other non-album tracks that appeared in ''[[Halo 2]]'' and ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]''. The band's manager, Larry Mazer (who was also named in the lawsuit), asserted that the lawsuit was \"totally frivolous\" and his termination had \"nothing to do with the paternity leave.\" Mazer said the band received no payment for the ''Halo 2'' appearance, adding that the song was included for promotional reasons and Burnley was happy to have it in the video game. The band received minimal payment for the ''National Treasure 2'' appearance, and Mazer stated that otherwise, \"[Hummel] is 100 per cent current.\"{{sfn|Amerman|2005|p=1a}} Ben \"B.C.\" Vaught served as a sit-in drummer for the band,{{sfn|Sisak|2011}} and they later toured with [[3 Doors Down]] and [[Staind]] in November 2005.{{sfn|Business Wire|2005}} The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount in April 2006.{{sfn|Sisak|2011}}\n\n===''Phobia'' (2005\u20132007)===\nAfter the departure of Jeremy Hummel, Breaking Benjamin auditioned fifteen drummers, of whom [[Chad Szeliga]] stood out for his ability as a stage performer and the fact that he had \"serious problem-solving skills\", according to Burnley.{{sfn|Modern Drummer|2010}} The group's next album, ''[[Phobia (Breaking Benjamin album)|Phobia]]'', was again produced by Bendeth and was the first to be recorded with Szeliga.{{sfn|Apar|2006}} The concept of the album is dedicated to Burnley's various [[phobia]]s.

It received praise for general composition and musicianship but received criticism for a lack of originality.

It was the first album Burnley wrote while completely sober.{{sfn|Lipshutz|2009}} In 2007, Burnley experienced fatigue and [[phosphene]]s following three consecutive days of no sleep and heavy drinking, after which he decided to remain [[Sobriety|sober]].{{sfn|Wiederhorn|2015}} Burnley acknowledged an improved clarity and coherence within ''Dear Agony'' due to his sobriety.{{sfn|Florino|2010}} The album cover features Burnley's [[Magnetic resonance imaging|brain scan]], representing the recurrent themes on ''Dear Agony'' related to the singer's chronic illnesses caused by alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Lipshutz|2009}}\n\nBurnley collaborated with then-Red guitarist [[Jasen Rauch]] on various tracks for ''Dear Agony'': The two equally wrote together the songs \"Without You\" and \"Hopeless\", and Rauch wrote the outro for \"I Will Not Bow\", also helping write \"Lights Out\".{{sfn|Lello|2009}} Burnley said of the collaboration, \"I love writing with him because he does stuff exactly like I would've done,\" adding, \"writing-wise, we're like the same person.\"{{sfn|Lello|2009}}\n\n''Dear Agony'' was released on September 9, 2009, and peaked at No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' 200.{{sfn|Billboard 200}} The disc initially outsold its predecessor in its first week, moving more than 134,000 copies.{{sfn|Bishop|2014}} It ultimately achieved gold certification on February 16, 2010.{{sfn|RIAA}} The album's lead single \"[[I Will Not Bow]]\" reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart,{{sfn|Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs}} and went platinum on November 24, 2015.{{sfn|RIAA}} The other two singles, \"[[Lights Out (Breaking Benjamin song)|Lights Out]]\" and \"[[Give Me a Sign]]\", peaked at No. 9{{sfn|Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs 100904}} and No. 6{{sfn|Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs 100417}} on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, respectively (the latter of which also receiving a gold certification on November 24, 2015).{{sfn|RIAA}}\n\nBreaking Benjamin toured in support of the album in January and February 2010 with Three Days Grace and [[Flyleaf (band)|Flyleaf]],{{sfn|Ultimate Guitar|2010}} then with Red, [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]], and [[Thousand Foot Krutch]] in March 2010.{{sfn|Tunelab|2010}} In April, Breaking Benjamin began touring with [[Nickelback]], [[Shinedown]], and [[Sick Puppies]] on their [[Dark Horse Tour]].{{sfn|Morentin|2010}} Prior to the last show of the Dark Horse Tour, Burnley stated he was ill and therefore no longer able to tour in support of the album, placing the band on hiatus.{{sfn|Sisak|2011}} After internet rumors began to circulate that the band had broken up, Burnley released a statement \"officially letting everyone know that Breaking Benjamin has not broken up.\"{{sfn|Sisak|2011}}\n\n''Dear Agony'' received mixed critical reception. AllMusic's James Monger gave the album a positive review, stating it \"feels a lot like their first three\", noting a consistency that \"feels like a well-oiled machine.\"{{sfn|Monger|2009}} The disc received a negative review from [[Consequence of Sound]]'s Alex Young, who complained of over-production and the disc's sell-out nature at the hands of three-time Breaking Benjamin producer David Bendeth: \"Dear Agony is the unfortunate side effect of a trend in 'producer' David Bendeth's world, training wild chimpanzees to be more tasteful whilst handling silverware\", ultimately giving the record a half-star \"for teaching Breaking Benjamin's peers who not to hire for production credit.\"{{sfn|Young|2009}} [[About.com|About Entertainment]] gave the record a mixed review, feeling that \"Though it lacks the breakthrough singles of ''Phobia'', ''Dear Agony'' does have its moments,\" adding, \"frustratingly, ''Dear Agony'' never reaches greatness, settling for an admirable competency that's still the envy of many of their contemporaries.\"{{sfn|Grierson|2009}}\n\n===Hiatus and ''Shallow Bay'' (2010\u20132013)===\nIn March 2010, Hollywood Records requested that the band produce two new master recordings and a greatest hits album, and sought permission to release a new version of the hit song \"Blow Me Away\" featuring Sydnee Duran of Valora.{{sfn|Sisak|2011}} In May 2011, Fink and Klepaski granted the record company's requests after they were offered a $100,000 payment.{{sfn|Sisak|Gaydos|2011}} Burnley, alleging that Fink and Klepaski acted unilaterally on both the song remix and the compilation album, not informing him or the band's management, fired the two via email, demanding at least $250,000 in punitive fees and compensatory damages, as well as the exclusive right to the name Breaking Benjamin.{{sfn|Sisak|Gaydos|2011}} Fink and Klepaski's attorneys stated the two \"dispute and strictly deny\" Burnley's allegations, instead asserting that a January 2009 agreement (allowing Burnley to dismiss them for \"just cause\") was no longer valid because of the singer's status of indefinite hiatus.{{sfn|Sisak|Gaydos|2011}} The case was ordered by a judge to arbitration.{{sfn|Sisak|Gaydos|2011}} Burnley's attorney, Brian Caplan, told the [[Associated Press]], \"The relationship between Mr. Burnley and the two other members of the band has ended ...
