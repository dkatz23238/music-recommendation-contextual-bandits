The tour helped create eager anticipation for Mitchell's second LP, ''[[Clouds (Joni Mitchell album)|Clouds]]'', which was released in April 1969. This album contained Mitchell's own versions of some of her songs already recorded and performed by other artists: \"[[Chelsea Morning]]\", \"[[Both Sides, Now]]\", and \"Tin Angel\".

The following month, Reprise released her third album, ''[[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|Ladies of the Canyon]]''. Mitchell's sound was already beginning to expand beyond the confines of acoustic folk music and toward pop and rock, with more overdubs, percussion, and backing vocals, and for the first time, many songs composed on piano, which became a hallmark of Mitchell's style in her most popular era. Her own version of \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\", slower than the cover by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]], was performed solo on a [[Wurlitzer electric piano]]. The album also included the already-familiar song \"The Circle Game\" and the environmental anthem \"[[Big Yellow Taxi]]\", with its now-famous line, \"they paved paradise and put up a parking lot.\"\n\n''Ladies of the Canyon'' was an instant smash on [[FM radio]] and sold briskly, eventually becoming Mitchell's first gold album (selling over a half million copies). She made a decision to stop touring for a year and just write and paint, yet she was still voted \"Top Female Performer\" for 1970 by ''[[Melody Maker]]'', a leading UK pop music magazine. On the April 1971 release of [[James Taylor]]'s ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]'' album, Mitchell is credited with backup vocals on the track \"[[You've Got a Friend]]\". The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience appeared on her next album, ''[[Blue (Joni Mitchell album)|Blue]]'', released in June 1971. Comparing Joni Mitchell's talent to his own, David Crosby said, \"By the time she did ''Blue'', she was past me and rushing toward the horizon\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122575310809894821|title=A 65th Birthday Tribute to Joni Mitchell|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=November 4, 2008|first=Jim|last=Fusilli|access-date=March 27, 2015|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402184143/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122575310809894821|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Blue'' was an almost instant critical and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' albums chart in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced \"[[Carey (song)|Carey]]\" was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of ''Blue'' departed further from the sounds of ''Ladies of the Canyon''. Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell's voice and emotions (\"All I Want\", \"[[A Case of You (song)|A Case of You]]\"), while others such as \"[[Blue (Joni Mitchell song)|Blue]]\", \"[[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]]\" and \"[[The Last Time I Saw Richard]]\" were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most [[confessional poetry|confessional]] album, Mitchell later said of ''Blue'', \"I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup,&nbsp;... singing 'I'm selfish and I'm sad', for instance.

''Court and Spark'' went to No. 1 on the ''Cashbox'' Album Charts. The LP made Mitchell a widely popular act for perhaps the only time in her career, on the strength of popular tracks such as the rocker \"[[Raised on Robbery]]\", which was released right before Christmas 1973, and \"[[Help Me (Joni Mitchell song)|Help Me]]\", which was released in March of the following year, and became Mitchell's only Top 10 single when it peaked at No. 7 in the first week of June. \"[[Free Man in Paris]]\" was another hit single and staple in her catalog.\n\nWhile recording ''Court and Spark'', Mitchell had tried to make a clean break with her earlier folk sound, producing the album herself and employing jazz/pop [[fusion (music)|fusion]] band the [[L.A. Express]] as what she called her first real backing group. In February 1974, her tour with the L.A. Express began, and they received rave notices as they traveled across the United States and Canada during the next two months. A series of shows at L.A.'s [[Universal Amphitheater]] from August 14\u201317 were recorded for a live album. In November, Mitchell released that album, ''[[Miles of Aisles]]'', a two-record set including all but two songs from the L.A. concerts (one selection each from the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]], on March 2, and the L.A. Music Center, on March 4, were also included in the set). The live album slowly moved up to No. 2, matching ''Court and Spark''{{'}}s chart peak on ''Billboard''. \"Big Yellow Taxi\", the live version, was also released as a single and did reasonably well (she released another version of the song in 2007).\n\nIn January 1975, ''Court and Spark'' received four nominations for Grammy Awards, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], for which Mitchell was the only woman nominated. She won only the [[Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals]].\n\n===1975\u20131977: ''The Hissing of Summer Lawns'' and ''Hejira''===\n[[File:Joni Mitchell (1975).png|thumb|right|Mitchell in 1975|231x231px]]\nMitchell went into the studio in early 1975 to record acoustic demos of some songs that she had written since the ''Court and Spark'' tour. A few months later she recorded versions of the tunes with her band. Her musical interests were now diverging from both the folk and the pop scene of the era, toward less structured, more jazz-inspired pieces, with a wider range of instruments. The new song cycle was released in November 1975 as ''[[The Hissing of Summer Lawns]]''. On \"The Jungle Line\", she made an early effort at [[sample (music)|sampling]] a recording of African musicians, something that became more commonplace among Western rock acts in the 1980s. \"In France They Kiss on Main Street\" continued the lush pop sounds of ''Court and Spark'', and efforts such as the title song and \"Edith and the Kingpin\" chronicled the underbelly of suburban lives in Southern California.\n\nDuring 1975, Mitchell also participated in several concerts in the [[Rolling Thunder Revue tours]] featuring [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joan Baez]], and in 1976 she performed as part of ''[[The Last Waltz]]'' by [[the Band]]. In January 1976, Mitchell received a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for the album ''The Hissing of Summer Lawns'', though the 1976 Grammy for that category went to [[Linda Ronstadt]].\n\nIn early 1976, Mitchell traveled with friends who were driving cross country to Maine. Afterwards, she drove back to California alone and composed several songs during her journey which featured on her next album, 1976's ''[[Hejira (album)|Hejira]]''. She stated that \"This album was written mostly while I was traveling in the car. That's why there were no piano songs&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"crowe\" /> ''Hejira'' was arguably Mitchell's most experimental album so far, owing to her ongoing collaborations with jazz virtuoso bass guitarist [[Jaco Pastorius]] on several songs, namely the first single, \"[[Coyote (song)|Coyote]]\", the atmospheric \"Hejira\", the disorienting, guitar-heavy \"Black Crow\", and the album's last song \"Refuge of the Roads\". The album climbed to No. 13 on the Billboard Charts, reaching gold status three weeks after release, and received airplay from album-oriented FM rock stations.

In 2006 she said, \"I suppose a lot of people could have written a lot of my other songs, but I feel the songs on ''Hejira'' could only have come from me.\"<ref name=\"ottawa\" />\n\n===1977\u20131980: ''Don Juan's Reckless Daughter'' and ''Mingus''===\nIn mid-1977, Mitchell began work on new recordings that became her first double studio album. Close to completing her contract with Asylum Records, Mitchell felt that this album could be looser in feel than any album she had done in the past. She invited Pastorius back, and he brought with him fellow members of jazz fusion pioneers [[Weather Report]], including drummer [[Don Alias]] and saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]]. Layered, atmospheric compositions such as \"Overture/Cotton Avenue\" featured more improvisatory collaboration, while \"Paprika Plains\" was a 16-minute epic that stretched the boundaries of pop, owing more to Mitchell's memories of childhood in Canada and her study of classical music. \"Dreamland\" and \"The Tenth World\", featuring [[Chaka Khan]] on backing vocals, were percussion-dominated tracks. Other songs continued the jazz-rock-folk collisions of ''Hejira''. Mitchell also revived \"Jericho\", written years earlier (a version is found on her 1974 live album) but never recorded in a studio setting.\n\n''[[Don Juan's Reckless Daughter]]'' was released in December 1977. The album received mixed reviews but still sold relatively well, peaking at No. 25 in the US and going gold within three months. The cover of the album would later create occasional controversy: Mitchell was featured on the cover in blackface disguise, wearing a curly afro wig, a white suit and vest, and dark sunglasses. The character, whom she called [[Art Nouveau]], was based on a pimp who, she says, once complimented her while walking down an LA street. This character who symbolized her turn toward jazz and streetwise lyrics reappears in the concert video 'Shadows and Light', her contribution to the film anthology 'Love', and the music video for \"Beat of Black Wings\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The only black man at the Party: Joni Mitchell enters the rock canon|first=Miles Parks|last=Grier|journal=Genders|issue=56|date=September 2012|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2532|access-date=October 24, 2015|archive-date=September 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905092823/http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2532|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA few months after the release of ''Don Juan's Reckless Daughter'', Mitchell was contacted by the esteemed jazz composer, bandleader and bassist [[Charles Mingus]], who had heard the orchestrated song \"Paprika Plains\", and wanted her to work with him. She began a collaboration with Mingus, who died before the project was completed in 1979. She finished the tracks, and the resulting album, ''[[Mingus (Joni Mitchell album)|Mingus]]'', was released in June 1979, though it was poorly received in the press. Fans were confused over such a major change in Mitchell's overall sound, and though the album topped out at No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' albums chart\u2014a higher placement than ''Don Juan's Reckless Daughter''\u2014''Mingus'' still fell short of gold status, making it her first album since the 1960s to not sell at least half a million copies.\n\nMitchell's tour to promote ''Mingus'' began in August 1979 in Oklahoma City and concluded six weeks later with five shows at Los Angeles' [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] and one at the [[Santa Barbara Bowl|Santa Barbara County Bowl]], where she recorded and filmed the concert. It was her first tour in several years, and with Pastorius, jazz guitarist [[Pat Metheny]], and other members of her band, Mitchell also performed songs from her other jazz-inspired albums. When the tour ended she began a year of work, turning the tapes from the Santa Barbara County Bowl show into a two-album set and a concert film, both to be called ''[[Shadows and Light (Joni Mitchell album)|Shadows and Light]]''. Her final release on Asylum Records and her second live double album, it was released in September 1980, and made it up to No. 38 on the ''Billboard'' charts. A single from the LP, \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\", Mitchell's duet with [[The Persuasions]] (her opening act for the tour), bubbled under on ''Billboard'', just missing the Hot 100.\n\n===1981\u20131987: ''Wild Things Run Fast'', ''Dog Eat Dog'', and second marriage===\nFor a year and a half, Mitchell worked on the tracks for her next album.\n\nWhile the album was being readied for release, her friend [[David Geffen]], founder of [[Asylum Records]], decided to start a new label, [[Geffen Records]]. Still distributed by Warner Bros. (who controlled Asylum Records), Geffen negated the remaining contractual obligations Mitchell had with Asylum and signed her to his new label. ''[[Wild Things Run Fast]]'' (1982) marked a return to pop songwriting, including \"Chinese Cafe/[[Unchained Melody]]\", which incorporated the chorus and parts of the melody of the famous [[The Righteous Brothers]] hit, and \"[[(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care]]\", a remake of the [[Elvis]] chestnut, which charted higher than any Mitchell single since her 1970s sales peak when it climbed to No. 47 on the charts. The album peaked on the ''Billboard'' charts in its fifth week at No. 25.\n[[File:Joni Mitchell 1983.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Mitchell performing in 1983]]\n\nDuring this period she recorded with bassist and sound engineer [[Larry Klein]], whom she married in 1982.\n\nIn early 1983, Mitchell began a world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia and then going back to the United States. A performance from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video (and later DVD) as ''Refuge of the Roads''. As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. British [[synthpop]] performer and producer [[Thomas Dolby]] was brought on board. Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented: \"I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record [by Geffen], and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did have some problems&nbsp;... He may be able to do it faster. He may be able to do it better, but the fact is that it then wouldn't really be my music.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=661|title=Joni Mitchell|work=New Musical Express|date=November 30, 1985|first=Alan|last=Jackson|access-date=April 29, 2014|archive-date=April 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430062307/http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=661|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe album that resulted, ''[[Dog Eat Dog (Joni Mitchell album)|Dog Eat Dog]]'', released in October 1985, turned out to be only a moderate seller, peaking at No. 63 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top Albums Chart, Mitchell's lowest chart position since her first album peaked at No. 189 almost eighteen years before. One of the songs on the album, \"Tax Free\", created controversy by lambasting \"[[televangelist]]s\" and what she saw as a drift to the [[Christian right|religious right]] in American politics. \"The churches came after me\", she wrote, \"they attacked me, though the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian Church]], which I've seen described as the only church in America which actually uses its head, wrote me a letter of congratulation.\"<ref name=\"irishtimes\"/>\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm'' and ''Night Ride Home''===\nMitchell continued experimenting with synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers for the recordings of her next album, 1988's ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm]]''. She also collaborated with artists including [[Willie Nelson]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Wendy & Lisa]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Don Henley]], [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[Benjamin Orr]] of the [[The Cars|Cars]]. The album's first official single, \"My Secret Place\", was in fact a duet with Gabriel, and just missed the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart. The song \"Lakota\" was one of many songs on the album to take on larger political themes, in this case the [[Wounded Knee incident]], the deadly battle between Native American activists and the FBI on [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in the previous decade. Musically, several songs fit into the trend of [[world music]] popularized by Gabriel during the era. Reviews were mostly favorable towards the album, and the cameos by well-known musicians brought it considerable attention. ''Chalk Mark'' ultimately improved on the chart performance of ''Dog Eat Dog'', peaking at No. 45.\n\nIn 1990, Mitchell, who by then rarely performed live, participated in [[Roger Waters]]' ''[[The Wall Concert in Berlin]]''. She performed the song \"[[Goodbye Blue Sky]]\" and was also one of the performers on the concert's final song \"[[The Tide Is Turning]]\" along with Waters, [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Paul Carrack]].\n\nThroughout the first half of 1990, Mitchell recorded songs that appeared on her next album. She delivered the final mixes for the new album to Geffen just before Christmas, after trying nearly a hundred different sequences for the songs. The album ''[[Night Ride Home]]'' was released in March 1991. In the United States, it premiered on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top Albums chart at No. 68, moving up to No. 48 in its second week, and peaking at No. 41 in its sixth week. In the United Kingdom, the album premiered at No. 25 on the albums chart. Critically, it was better received than her 1980s work{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}. This album was also Mitchell's first since Geffen Records was sold to [[MCA Inc.]], meaning that ''Night Ride Home'' was her first album not to be initially distributed by WEA (now [[Warner Music Group]]).\n\n===1994\u20131999: ''Turbulent Indigo'', ''Taming the Tiger'', and divorce===\n[[File:Joni Mitchell pets Buddy in the oval office.jpg|thumb|Mitchell pets [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]]'s dog [[Buddy (dog)|Buddy]] in the [[Oval Office]] in 1998|265x265px]]\nTo wider audiences, the real return to form for Mitchell came with 1994's [[Grammy]]-winning ''[[Turbulent Indigo]]''. The recording of the album coincided with the end of Mitchell's marriage to musician [[Larry Klein]] after 12 years; Klein was also co-producer of the album.\n\n''Indigo'' was seen as Mitchell's most accessible set of songs in years. Songs such as \"Sex Kills\", \"Sunny Sunday\", \"Borderline\" and \"The Magdalene Laundries\" mixed social commentary and guitar-focused melodies for \"a startling comeback\".<ref name=\"Toronto\">{{cite news |last=Gill |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1575 |title=Joni Mitchell in person |work=The Globe and Mail |date=February 17, 2007 |access-date=March 11, 2007 |format=reprint |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095944/http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1575 |url-status=live}}</ref> The album won two Grammy awards, including Best Pop Album, and it coincided with a much-publicized resurgence in interest in Mitchell's work by a younger generation of singer-songwriters.\n\nIn 1996, Mitchell agreed to release a greatest ''[[Hits (Joni Mitchell album)|Hits]]'' collection, despite initial concerns that such a release would damage sales of her catalog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=262|title=Joni Mitchell Library - Joni Mitchell offers Hits and Misses: Billboard, August 24, 1996|website=jonimitchell.com}}</ref>  Reprise also agreed to release a second album, called ''[[Misses (album)|Misses]]'', that would include some of the lesser-known songs from her career. ''Hits'' charted at No. 161 in the US, but made No. 6 in the UK. Mitchell also included on ''Hits'', for the first time on an album, her first recording, a version of \"Urge for Going\" which preceded ''Song to a Seagull'' but was previously released only as a [[B-side]].\n\n[[File:Joni Mitchell and Peter Bogner.jpg|thumb|left|Joni Mitchell and Peter Bogner listening to premix of [[Herbie Hancock]]'s ''[[Gershwin's World]]'' ([[Venice Beach, California]], in 1999)|251x251px]]\nTwo years later, Mitchell released her final set of \"original\" new work before nearly a decade of other pursuits, 1998's ''[[Taming the Tiger]]''. She promoted ''Tiger'' with a return to regular concert appearances, including a co-headlining tour with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Van Morrison]].\n\nOn the album, Mitchell had played a custom guitar equipped with a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] hexaphonic pickup that connected to a Roland VG-8 modeling processor. The device allowed Mitchell to play any of her many alternate tunings without having to re-tune the guitar. The guitar's output, through the VG-8, was transposed to any of her tunings in real-time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8477480/joni-mitchell-taming-the-tiger-album|title=Joni Mitchell's 'Taming the Tiger' Turns 20: Why the Spaced-Out Album Deserves More Applause|date=September 29, 2018|first=Morgan|last=Enos|magazine=Billboard|access-date=April 25, 2019|archive-date=April 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430231351/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8477480/joni-mitchell-taming-the-tiger-album|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt was around this time that critics also began to notice a real change in Mitchell's voice, particularly on her older songs; the singer later confirmed the change, explaining that \"I'd go to hit a note and there was nothing there\".<ref name=\"renai\">{{cite news |last=Eggar |first=Robin |url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1569 |title=The Renaissance Woman |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |location=UK |date=February 11, 2007 |access-date=March 9, 2007 |format=reprint |archive-date=April 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430062311/http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1569 |url-status=live}}</ref> While her more limited range and huskier vocals have sometimes been attributed to her smoking (she was described by journalist Robin Eggar as \"one of the world's last great smokers\"),<ref name=\"renai\" /> Mitchell believes that the changes in her voice that became noticeable in the 1990s were because of other problems, including vocal nodules, a compressed larynx, and the lingering effects of having had polio.<ref name=\"renai\" /> In an interview in 2004, she denied that \"my terrible habits\" had anything to do with her more limited range, and pointed out that singers often lose the upper register when they pass fifty. In addition, she contended that her voice had acquired a more interesting and expressive alto range when she could no longer hit the high notes, let alone hold them as she had in her youth.<ref>National Public Radio.</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132005: ''Both Sides Now'', retirement tour and retrospectives===\nThe singer's next two albums featured no new songs and, Mitchell has said, were recorded to \"fulfill contractual obligations\",<ref name=\"Toronto\" /> but on both she attempted to make use of her new vocal range in interpreting familiar material. ''[[Both Sides Now (Joni Mitchell album)|Both Sides Now]]'' (2000) was an album composed mostly of covers of jazz standards, performed with an orchestra, featuring orchestral arrangements by [[Vince Mendoza]]. The album also contained remakes of \"A Case of You\" and the title track \"Both Sides, Now\", two early hits transposed down to Mitchell's now dusky, soulful alto range. It received mostly strong reviews and motivated a short national tour, with Mitchell accompanied by a core band featuring her ex-husband Larry Klein on bass plus a local orchestra on each tour stop. Its success led to 2002's ''[[Travelogue (Joni Mitchell album)|Travelogue]]'', a collection of re-workings of her previous songs with lush orchestral accompaniments.\n\nMitchell stated at the time that ''Travelogue'' would be her final album. In a 2002 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', she voiced discontent with the current state of the music industry, describing it as a \"cesspool\".<ref name=\"wild\" /> Mitchell expressed her dislike of the record industry's dominance and her desire to control her own destiny, possibly by releasing her own music over the Internet.\n\nDuring the next few years, the only albums Mitchell released were compilations of her earlier work. In 2003, her Geffen recordings were collected in a remastered four-disc box set, ''The Complete Geffen Recordings'', including notes by Mitchell and three previously unreleased tracks. A series of themed compilations of songs from earlier albums were also released: ''The Beginning of Survival'' (2004), ''[[Dreamland (Joni Mitchell album)|Dreamland]]'' (2004), and ''Songs of a Prairie Girl'' (2005), the last of which collected the threads of her Canadian upbringing and which she released after accepting an invitation to the [[Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan Centennial]] concert in Saskatoon. The concert, which featured a tribute to Mitchell, was also attended by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. In the ''Prairie Girl'' liner notes, she wrote that the collection is \"my contribution to Saskatchewan's Centennial celebrations\".\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mitchell signed a deal with [[Random House]] to publish an autobiography.<ref>Dickinson, Chrissie.

The use of alternative tunings allows guitarists to produce accompaniment with more varied and wide-ranging textures. Her right-hand picking/strumming technique has evolved over the years from an initially intricate picking style, typified by the guitar songs on her first album, to a looser and more rhythmic style, sometimes incorporating percussive \"slaps\".\n\nIn 1995, Mitchell's friend Fred Walecki, proprietor of Westwood Music in Los Angeles, developed a solution to alleviate her continuing frustration with using multiple alternative tunings in live settings. Walecki designed a Stratocaster-style guitar to function with the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] VG-8 [[Guitar synthesizer|virtual guitar]], a system capable of configuring her numerous tunings electronically. While the guitar itself remained in standard tuning, the VG-8 encoded the pickup signals into digital signals which were then translated into the altered tunings. This allowed Mitchell to use one guitar on stage, while an off-stage tech entered the preprogrammed tuning for each song in her set.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=38|title=JMDL LIBRARY: The guitar odyssey of Joni Mitchell: My Secret Place: Acoustic Guitar, August 1996|publisher=Jonimitchell.com|access-date=November 26, 2014|archive-date=July 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721232112/http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=38|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMitchell was highly innovative [[harmony|harmonically]] in her early work (1966\u20131972), incorporating [[Mode (music)|modality]], [[chromaticism]], and [[pedal point]]s.<ref>Lloyd Whitesell, \"Harmonic Palette in Early Joni Mitchell\", p. 173.

Pop group Neighborhood in 1970 and [[Amy Grant]] in 1995 scored hits with covers of \"Big Yellow Taxi\", the third-most covered song in Mitchell's repertoire (with over 300 covers).<ref name=\"covers\"/> More recent releases of this song included versions by [[Counting Crows]] in 2002 and [[Nena]] in 2007. [[Janet Jackson]] used a sample of the chorus of \"Big Yellow Taxi\" as the centerpiece of her 1997 hit single \"[[Got 'Til It's Gone]]\", which also features rapper [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] saying \"Joni Mitchell never lies\". \"[[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]]\", from Mitchell's album ''Blue'' became the second-most covered song of Mitchell's in 2013 as many artists chose it for their holiday albums.<ref name=\"covers\"/> Rap artists [[Kanye West]] and [[Mac Dre]] have also sampled Mitchell's vocals in their music. In addition, [[Annie Lennox]] has covered \"Ladies of the Canyon\" for the B-side of her 1995 hit \"[[No More I Love You's]]\". [[Mandy Moore]] covered \"Help Me\" in 2003. In 2004 singer [[George Michael]] covered her song \"Edith and the Kingpin\" for a radio show. \"River\" has been one of the most popular songs covered in recent years, with versions by [[Dianne Reeves]] (1999), [[James Taylor]] (recorded for television in 2000, and for CD release in 2004), [[Allison Crowe]] (2004), [[Rachael Yamagata]] (2004), [[Aimee Mann]] (2005), and [[Sarah McLachlan]] (2006). McLachlan also did a version of \"Blue\" in 1996, and [[Cat Power]] recorded a cover of \"Blue\" in 2008. Other Mitchell covers include the famous \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]], [[Eva Cassidy]], and [[Matthews Southern Comfort]]; \"[[This Flight Tonight]]\" by [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]; and well-known versions of \"A Case of You\" by [[Tori Amos]], [[Michelle Branch]], [[Jane Monheit]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Diana Krall]], [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]], and [[Ana Moura]]. A 40th anniversary version of \"Woodstock\" was released in 2009 by Nick Vernier Band featuring Ian Matthews (formerly of Matthews Southern Comfort). Fellow Canadian singer [[k.d. lang]] recorded two of Mitchell's songs (\"A Case of You\" and \"Jericho\") for her 2004 album ''[[Hymns of the 49th Parallel]]'' which is composed entirely of songs written by Canadian artists.\n\nPrince's version of \"A Case of U\" appeared on ''[[A Tribute to Joni Mitchell]]'', a 2007 compilation released by [[Nonesuch Records]], which also featured [[Bj\u00f6rk]] (\"The Boho Dance\"), [[Caetano Veloso]] (\"Dreamland\"), [[Emmylou Harris]] (\"The Magdalene Laundries\"), [[Sufjan Stevens]] (\"Free Man in Paris\") and [[Cassandra Wilson]] (\"For the Roses\"), among others.\n\nSeveral other songs reference Joni Mitchell. The song \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" by [[Graham Nash]] refers to Nash's two-year relationship with Mitchell at the time that Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded the ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' album. [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[Going to California]]\" was said to be written about [[Robert Plant]] and [[Jimmy Page]]'s [[Limerence|infatuation]] with Mitchell, a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that, in live performances, Plant often says \"Joni\" after the line \"To find a queen without a king, they say she plays guitar and cries and sings\". Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses. The [[Sonic Youth]] song \"[[Hey Joni]]\" is named for Mitchell. [[Alanis Morissette]] also mentions Mitchell in one of her songs, \"Your House\". British folk singer [[Frank Turner]] mentions Mitchell in his song \"Sunshine State\".

Taylor Swift also details Mitchell's departure from the music industry in her song \"The Lucky One\" from her 2012 album ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]''.\n\nIn 2003, playwright [[Bryden MacDonald]] launched ''When All the Slaves Are Free'', a musical revue based on Mitchell's music.<ref name=columbia>Gabrielle H.
