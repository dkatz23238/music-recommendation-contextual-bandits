The band took its name from lead vocalist [[Harry Wayne Casey]]'s last name ('KC') and the 'Sunshine Band' from KC's home state of Florida, the Sunshine State. The group has had six top 10 singles, five number one singles and a number two single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.\n\n==History==\n===1970s===\nThe band was formed in 1973 by [[Harry Wayne Casey]] (KC), a record store employee and part-timer at [[TK Records]] in Hialeah, Florida.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=145}}</ref> KC originally called the band '''KC & The Sunshine Junkanoo Band''', as he used studio musicians from TK and a local [[Junkanoo]] band called the Miami Junkanoo Band. He was introduced to [[Richard Finch (musician)|Richard Finch]], who was engineering records for TK, and the Casey-Finch musical collaboration began.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> They were soon joined by guitarist [[Jerome Smith (musician)|Jerome Smith]] and drummer Robert Johnson, both TK [[recording studio|studio]] [[session musician|musicians]].<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/>\n\nThe first few songs, \"Blow Your Whistle\" (September 1973) and \"Sound Your Funky Horn\" (February 1974), were released as singles, and did well enough on the U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart and overseas that TK wanted a follow-up single and album. In the meantime, while working on [[demo (music)|demos]] for KC & the Sunshine Band, the song \"[[Rock Your Baby]]\" ([[George McCrae]]) was created.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/>  It was written by Casey and featured Smith on guitar, and became a number one [[hit record|hit]] in 51 countries in mid-1974. The band's \"Queen of Clubs\", which featured uncredited [[human voice|vocals]] by McCrae, was a hit in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], peaking at number 7,<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> and they went on a [[concert tour|tour]] there in 1975.\n\nKC and other band members were frequent guests on WHYI-FM, branded as Y-100, one of southeast Florida's more powerful FM pop stations, that covered Dade and Broward Counties and beyond. This gave the band significant hometown exposure, during the rise of the disco genre in one of the music's epicenters.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cohen|first=Howard|date=January 28, 2021|title=Y-100 DJ Bill Tanner, \"...helped promote the careers of homegrown talents like KC and the Sunshine Band...|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/obituaries/article248835544.html|url-status=live|access-date=June 8, 2021|website=Miami Herald obituary}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of the self-titled second album ''[[KC and the Sunshine Band (album)|KC and the Sunshine Band]]'' in 1975 came the group's first major U.S. hit with \"[[Get Down Tonight]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> It topped the R&B chart in April and hit number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in August.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> \"[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]\" also became a number one hit<ref name=\"NYT\" /> in November 1975 and the group received four nominations and one win at the [[19th Annual Grammy Awards|1976 Grammy Awards]]. The 1976 album ''[[Part 3]]'' yielded two number one singles: \"[[I'm Your Boogie Man]]\"<ref name=\"NYT\" /> and \"[[(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty]]\".<ref name=\"NYT\" /> Another hit, \"[[Keep It Comin' Love]]\"(1977), peaked at number two. Their success lasted until the fifth album from 1979; their last chart topping hit was \"[[Please Don't Go (KC and the Sunshine Band song)|Please Don't Go]]\", hitting number one<ref name=\"NYT\" /> for one week in January 1980, and becoming the first number one hit of the 1980s. With the explosion of [[new wave music]] and the declining popularity of disco, the group explored other styles and changed labels, joining [[Epic Records]] in 1980 after TK Records went bankrupt.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/>\n\nWith a change in styles, Casey enjoyed success, dueting with [[Teri DeSario]] with \"[[Yes, I'm Ready]]\", which hit No. 2 in March 1980;<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> the adult contemporary sound was much different from his disco hits of the 1970s, and his first major success away from the Sunshine Band.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1981, the partnership between Finch and Casey came to an acrimonious end. Two years after the release of the previous album, the band released two albums with new material: ''[[The Painter (KC and the Sunshine Band album)|The Painter]]'' (1981) and ''[[Space Cadet Solo Flight]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> These albums generated little success, but in 1982, a hit track called \"[[Give It Up (KC and the Sunshine Band song)|Give It Up]]\" from the album ''[[All in a Night's Work]]'' (1982) brought a return to success in the UK, and appeared two years later in the U.S. Top 40.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> The song was also featured on the band's next album, 1984's ''[[KC Ten]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/>Epic Records, however, refused to issue the song as a single due to its prior failure in the US. Because of this, a frustrated Casey formed Meca Records, releasing the single himself on this label in a final attempt to garner the song some success in America. It worked, but the album still failed to meet expectations. This led to the group falling into stasis around 1985 with Casey's retirement.\n\n===1990s===\nA revival of interest in disco music in 1991 brought Casey out of retirement. He reformed the band with some new members and two other original members, (the percussionist Fermin Goytisolo and vocalist Beverly Champion-Foster) and began touring once again. The new band has released a large number of [[compilation album]]s through [[Rhino Records]], along with some newly recorded material. The album ''[[Oh Yeah! (KC and the Sunshine Band album)|Oh Yeah!]]'' was released in 1993 after a ten-year gap between new albums (excluding compilations).\n\n===2000s and beyond===\n[[File:KC & The Sunshine Band2.jpg|upright=1.25|[[KC and the Sunshine Band]] performing in 2006|thumb]]\nOn July 28, 2000, guitarist [[Jerome Smith (musician)|Jerome Smith]] died accidentally while working as a bulldozer operator.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E6DD163FF933A2575BC0A9669C8B63|title=Obituaries: Jerome Smith, 47, of K.
