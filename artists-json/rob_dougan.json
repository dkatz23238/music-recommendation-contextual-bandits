He is known primarily for his breakthrough 1995 single \"[[Clubbed to Death (instrumental)|Clubbed to Death (Kurayamino Variation)]]\", further popularised by 1999's ''[[The Matrix]]'' soundtrack. \"Clubbed to Death\" was re-released on his debut album ''[[Furious Angels]]'' in 2002, seven years after its initial release, as well as providing several variations of the song, most notably the Kurayamino variation; he has also provided a variation of the [[Moby]] song \"[[Porcelain (song)|Porcelain]]\". In 1995, he teamed up with [[Rollo Armstrong]] to remix the [[U2]] song \"[[Numb (U2 song)|Numb]]\"; the remix was titled \"Numb (Gimme Some More Dignity Mix)\".\n\n==Early life and education==\nDougan was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 1969<ref>{{cite web|title=Rob Dougan Profile|url=https://lapeira.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/andrew-jefford-profile-rob-dougan-la-peira-gtw-issue-oct-20131.pdf}}</ref> and raised in [[Sydney]]. He attended [[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview]], and then the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]], where he studied acting. In 1990, he travelled to [[London]], and began to work in music with his friend [[Rollo Armstrong|Rollo]], both of whom had worked together and released material in Australia.\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1991 to 1995, Dougan was a [[record producer|producer]] and [[remix]] artist. In 1994, his remixes started charting in the United Kingdom. He also released his first single, \"Hard Times\".\n\nIn 1995, his hit single \"Clubbed to Death\" gave him a recognised name in the UK [[Nightclub|dance club]] scene. He produced half a dozen remixes of it, including the \"Kurayamino Variation\". His label [[Mo' Wax|Mo' Wax Records]] was pleased and commissioned the follow-up, \"Clubbed to Death 2\" (later the bonus track on the album). CTD2 was never released as a single, but appeared on the [[James Lavelle]] disc of the 1996 DJ mix [[compilation album]], ''Cream Live 2''.\n\n\"Furious Angels\" was not released on Mo' Wax, but Dougan eventually released it as a single in 1998 on [[Rollo Armstrong|Rollo's]] label [[Cheeky Records]]. Dougan worked for the following six years, doing remixes and licensing his tracks, in order to self-produce the album, which was backed by a full [[orchestra]] and a full choir.{{Verify source|date=August 2010}} \"Furious Angels\" also featured as the musical score accompanying the introduction sequence for the 2000 racing simulation game ''[[Grand Prix 3]]''.\n\nIn 1999, his exposure increased dramatically when his \"Clubbed to Death (Kurayamino Variation)\" was featured on the soundtrack of ''[[The Matrix]]''. He contributed two more tracks to the soundtrack of 2003's Matrix sequel ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', \"Ch\u00e2teau\" and \"Kung Fu\" (a shortened version of \"Furious Angels\" made for ''The Matrix Reloaded''). \"I'm Not Driving Anymore (instrumental)\" was also used for the trailer of the film and as background music for the DVD menu.\n\nIn 2002 in the UK, and 2003 in the rest of the world, Dougan released his debut album ''[[Furious Angels]]'', which was met with \"Generally favorable\" reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/douganrob/furiousangels |title=Metacritic.com |publisher=Metacritic|date=3 June 2003 |access-date=2011-12-05}}</ref> Later in 2003, a two-disc re-release of ''Furious Angels'' featured all-instrumental versions on the second disc. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 2006, Dougan was reportedly writing \"a couple of songs\" for [[Sugababes]] (for whom he produced the single \"[[Too Lost in You]]\"), and working on two albums of his own&nbsp;\u2014 one original, one classical.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robdougan.org/rob/news.php |title=Robdougan.org |publisher=Robdougan.org |date=13 July 2006 |access-date=2011-12-05 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205130640/http://www.robdougan.org/rob/news.php |archive-date=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nA short film made for jewelry designer [[Solange Azagury-Partridge]], ''The Letter'', directed by [[Laurence Dunmore]] and starring [[Thandie Newton]] and [[Jason Isaacs]] features new music by Rob Dougan; the short film, however, does not mention the title of the song.<ref>{{cite web|author=solangeazaguryp |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxBamOvADlY |title=The Letter, by Solange Azagury-Partridge |publisher=YouTube |date=7 December 2009 |access-date=2011-12-05}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2015, Dougan released ''[[The 22nd Sunday in Ordinary Time Sessions]]'' on his official site.<ref name=\"ordinarytime\">{{cite web|url=http://robdougan.com|title=robdougan.com|access-date=12 May 2015}}</ref> The EP, recorded at London's Air Lyndhurst Studios with a 75-piece orchestra and 40-piece choir, consists of five instrumental songs and a 20-minute film of the sessions.\n\nIn October 2016, Dougan released ''[[Misc. Sessions]]'' EP on his official site.<ref name=\"ordinarytime\"/> The EP, recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] with a 10-piece and 50-piece string section, consists of five tracks, with orchestra and instrumental mixes and an 18-minute film.\n\nIn 2018 Dougan compiled and released ''[[Films: Past and Future]]'' his first solely instrumental release, comprising 21 tracks available for the first time on vinyl, CD and digital download. The album was released via direct-to-fan company [[PledgeMusic]] just at the time that the organisation announced it was experiencing issues and had failed to pay many artistes the monies that had been pledged to them.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} In a personal project update posted on 18 February, Rob confirmed that he had been affected by the issues but, having already released the album digitally, had met the costs of physical releases himself, with the CD, vinyl and accompanying book due for release on 4 March 2019.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nIn February 2019, Dougan released ''The Life of the World to Come'', a brand new four track EP which includes \"The Life of the World to Come\", \"Beautiful Things\", \"Quasimodo's Dream\" and \"And Then I Think of You\". Each song was released with an accompanying instrumental version and two of the tracks were [[cover versions]] - \"[[Doctor Dolittle (1967 film)|Beautiful Things]]\" written by [[Leslie Bricusse]] and \"[[Quasimodo's Dream]]\" by [[The Reels]]. The EP is published by Engard Ltd and was released by Dougan himself via [[Gumroad]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Rob Dougan Will You Follow Me (Instrumental).ogg\n|title=Rob Dougan \"Will You Follow Me\" (2002)\n|description=23 second clip of Will You Follow Me.
