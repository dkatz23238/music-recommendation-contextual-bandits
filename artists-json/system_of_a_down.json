Shortly after the event, System of a Down made what is known as ''Untitled 1995 Demo Tape'', which was not commercially released, but eventually appeared on file-sharing networks around the time of the band's success with ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'' about six years later. ''Demo Tape 2'' was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, ''Demo Tape 3''. In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan).<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" /> Khachaturian was replaced by [[John Dolmayan]].\n\nThe band's first official and professionally recorded song was on a collection called ''Hye Enk'' (\"We're Armenian\" in English), an [[Armenian genocide]] recognition compilation in 1997. After playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the [[Whisky a Go Go]] and [[Viper Room]], the band caught attention of producer [[Rick Rubin]], who asked them to keep in touch. Showing great interest, the group recorded ''Demo Tape 4'' near the end of 1997, specifically to be sent to [[Record label|record companies]]. Rubin signed the group to his [[American Recordings (record label)|American/Columbia Records]], with the band celebrating the signing with a performance at [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|The Roxy Theatre]] with [[Human Waste Project]] on September 12, 1997.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2009-10-28 |title=human waste project news |url=http://www.geocities.com/~humanwaste/news2.htm |access-date=2022-06-23 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028094447/http://www.geocities.com/~humanwaste/news2.htm |archive-date=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Afterwards, System began laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album with engineer [[Sylvia Massy]]. \"I loved them,\" Rubin recalled. \"They were my favourite band, but I didn't think anyone was going to like them apart from a small, likeminded group of people like me who were crazy.

They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles \"[[Sugar (System of a Down song)|Sugar]]\" and \"[[Spiders (System of a Down song)|Spiders]]\" became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer and [[Metallica]] before making their way to the second stage of [[Ozzfest]]. Following Ozzfest, they toured with [[Fear Factory]] and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] before headlining the [[Sno-Core Tour]] with [[Puya (band)|Puya]], [[Mr. Bungle]], The Cat and Incubus providing support.\n\nIn November 1998, System of a Down appeared on [[South Park|''South Park'']]'s ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album|Chef Aid]]'' album, providing the music for the song \"Will They Die 4 You?\" Near the end of the song, Tankian can be heard saying, \"Why must we kill our own kind?\" a line that would later be used in the song \"Boom!\" Although System of a Down is credited on the album, ''South Park'' character [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] does not introduce them as he does most of the other artists featured on the record.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chef Aid: The South Park Album |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/chef-aid-the-south-park-album-mw0000601245 |website=Allmusic |access-date=July 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Toxicity'' and ''Steal This Album!''

The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 fans showed up. Due to the large excess number of fans, the performance was canceled by fire marshals just before the group took the stage without announcement of the cancellation. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read \"System of a Down\" was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band's touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band's manager, David \"Beno\" Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Down's scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-wraiths-dark-punk-isnt-all-doom-and-gloom-9209187|title=The Wraith's Dark Punk Isn't All Doom and Gloom|last=Rogers|first=Paul|date=March 2, 2018|work=L.A.

Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the album's second single, \"[[Toxicity (song)|Toxicity]].\" Even with the controversy surrounding \"Chop Suey!\" (which earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with \"Toxicity\" and \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]].\" In May 2006, [[VH1]] listed \"Toxicity\" in the number 14 slot in the ''40 Greatest Metal Songs''.\n\nIn 2001, the band went on tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470460/20030310/system_of_a_down.jhtml|title=System Of A Down Bassist Sues Security Team For Humiliating Him In Front Of Fans|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=March 10, 2003 |publisher=MTV |access-date=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Despite the incident, the tour was a success and System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour together with [[Rammstein]] in 2001.\n\nIn late 2001, unreleased tracks from the ''Toxicity'' sessions made their way onto the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|title=The Daron Malakian Interview|first=Mike|last=Lancaster|date=March 28, 2003|publisher=Glendale High School Newspaper-the Explosion|access-date=July 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081821/http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref> This collection of tracks was dubbed ''Toxicity II'' by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, ''[[Steal This Album!]]'', which was released in November 2002. ''Steal This Album!'' resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. About 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s counter-culture book, ''[[Steal This Book]]'', as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the Internet. The song \"[[Innervision]]\" was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for \"Boom!\" was filmed with director [[Michael Moore]] as a protest against the [[War in Iraq]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=System Of A Down Goes 'Boom' With Moore |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71955/system-of-a-down-goes-boom-with-moore |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Mezmerize'', ''Hypnotize'', band hiatus and side projects (2004\u20132008) ===\n[[File:Serj Tankian.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Serj Tankian]] has gained a reputation for his large vocal range along with his unusual delivery.|left]]\nIn 2004, the group recorded the follow-up to ''Steal This Album!'': a double album, which they released in separate installments six months apart. The releases notably included album cover artwork by Malakian's father, Vartan Malakian, and were designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album, ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' was released on May 17, 2005, to favorable reviews by critics.

Additionally in 2006, concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the [[Armenian genocide]] were featured in the film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]],'' directed by [[Carla Garapedian]]. An interview with Tankian's grandfather, a survivor of the genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankian's and Dolmayan's meeting with then-Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States government's official recognition of the genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside the Turkish embassy in Washington, D.C., was also used in ''Screamers''.\n\nIn May 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with ''Guitar'' magazine. He told MTV, \"We're not breaking up.
