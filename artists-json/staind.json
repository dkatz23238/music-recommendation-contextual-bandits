The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Aaron Lewis]], lead guitarist [[Mike Mushok]], bassist and backing vocalist Johnny April, and drummer Jon Wysocki. The lineup has been stable outside of the 2011 departure of Wysocki, who was replaced by Sal Giancarelli. Staind has recorded seven studio albums: ''[[Tormented (Staind album)|Tormented]]'' (1996), ''[[Dysfunction (album)|Dysfunction]]'' (1999), ''[[Break the Cycle]]'' (2001), ''[[14 Shades of Grey]]'' (2003), ''[[Chapter V (Staind album)|Chapter V]]'' (2005), ''[[The Illusion of Progress]]'' (2008), and ''[[Staind (album)|Staind]]'' (2011). The band's activity became more sporadic after their self-titled release, with Lewis pursuing a solo [[country music]] career and Mushok subsequently joining the band [[Saint Asonia]], but they have continued to tour on and off in the following years. In 2016, Lewis reiterated that the band had not broken up, and would possibly create another album, but that his then-current focus was on his solo career. The band reunited more permanently in 2019 for several shows, continuing with live appearances in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.blabbermouth.net/news/staind-announces-2020-festival-appearances/|title=STAIND Announces 2020 Festival Appearances|date=December 11, 2019|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=October 6, 2020|archive-date=October 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201011161053/https://archive.blabbermouth.net/news/staind-announces-2020-festival-appearances/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many of their singles have reached high positions on U.S. rock and all-format charts as well, including \"[[It's Been Awhile]]\", \"[[Fade (Staind song)|Fade]]\", \"[[Price to Play]]\", \"[[So Far Away (Staind song)|So Far Away]]\", and \"[[Right Here (Staind song)|Right Here]]\".\n\n==History==\n===Early years and ''Tormented'' (1995\u20131998)===\nIn 1993, vocalist [[Aaron Lewis]] and guitarist Mike Mushok met at a Christmas party in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].
