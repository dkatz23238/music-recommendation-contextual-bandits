The [[mayor of Chicago]] is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The current mayor is [[Lori Lightfoot]]. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. As well as the mayor, Chicago's clerk and treasurer are also elected citywide.

During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized [[socialist]], [[anarchist]] and [[labor organization]]s.{{sfnp|Schneirov|1998|pp=173\u2013174}} For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been \"[[Red states and blue states|solid blue]]\" in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor since 1927, when [[William Hale Thompson|William Thompson]] was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chicago |url=http://www.hellenicaworld.com/USA/Geo/en/Chicago.html |access-date=2022-06-18 |website=www.hellenicaworld.com}}</ref>\n\nChicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but it is split between eight of Illinois' 19 [[Illinois's congressional districts|districts]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. All eight of the city's representatives are Democrats; only two Republicans have represented a significant portion of the city since 1973, for one term each: [[Robert P. Hanrahan]] from 1973 to 1975, and [[Michael Patrick Flanagan]] from 1995 to 1997.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Center for Illinois Politics \u2013 Connecting People to Politics |url=https://www.centerforilpolitics.org/ |access-date=2022-06-18 |website=www.centerforilpolitics.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Machine politics]] persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.{{sfnp|Montejano|1999|pp=33\u201334}} During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal \"independent\" faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of [[Harold Washington]] (in office 1983\u20131987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest-serving mayor, [[Richard M. Daley]], the son of Richard J. Daley. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=7 big ideas for making Illinois more (small-d) democratic \u2013 CHANGE Illinois |url=https://www.changeil.org/2022/03/7-big-ideas-for-making-illinois-more-small-d-democratic/ |access-date=2022-06-18}}</ref>\n\nThe city is home of former United States President [[Barack Obama]] and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]]; Barack Obama was formerly a state legislator representing Chicago and later a US senator.
