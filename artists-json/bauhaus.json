It was grounded in the idea of creating a [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] (\"comprehensive artwork\") in which all the arts would eventually be brought together.

Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.<ref>{{cite book |first=Rachel|last=Barnes |title=The 20th-Century art book |year=2001 |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-7148-3542-6 |edition=Reprinted.}}</ref>\n\nThe changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the [[pottery]] shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a [[private school]] and would not allow any supporters of [[Hannes Meyer]] to attend it.\n\n== Design style ==\nThe Bauhaus style tends to feature simple geometric shapes like rectangles and spheres,  without elaborate decorations. Buildings, furniture, and fonts often feature rounded corners and sometimes rounded walls. Other buildings are characterized by rectangular features, for example protruding balconies with flat, chunky railings facing the street, and long banks of windows. Furniture often uses chrome metal pipes that curve at corners.\n\n== Bauhaus and German modernism ==\nAfter Germany's defeat in [[World War I]] and the establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]], a renewed liberal spirit allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the [[Russian Revolution]], such as [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical.<ref>Evans, Richard J. ''The Coming of the Third Reich'', p. 416</ref> Just as important was the influence of the 19th-century English designer [[William Morris]] (1834\u20131896), who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and that there should be no distinction between form and function.<ref>''Funk and Wagnall's New Encyclopaedia'', Vol 5, p. 348</ref> Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.\n\nHowever, the most important influence on Bauhaus was [[modernism]], a cultural movement whose origins lay as early as the 1880s, and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War, despite the prevailing conservatism. The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus\u2014the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that [[mass production]] was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit\u2014were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded. The German national designers' organization [[Deutscher Werkbund]] was formed in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]] to harness the new potentials of mass production, with a mind towards preserving Germany's economic competitiveness with England. In its first seven years, the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany, and was copied in other countries. Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object, and whether or not a single proper form could exist, were argued out among its 1,870 members (by 1914).\n[[File:Joost Schmidt Bauhausausstellung 1923.jpg|thumb|200px|Poster for the Bauhausaustellung (1923)]]\nGerman architectural modernism was known as [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neues Bauen]]. Beginning in June 1907, [[Peter Behrens]]' pioneering [[industrial design]] work for the German electrical company [[AEG]] successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark [[AEG Turbine Factory]], and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel. Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] worked for him in this period.\n\nThe Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German [[zeitgeist]] had turned from emotional [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]] to the matter-of-fact [[New Objectivity]]. An entire group of working architects, including [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], turned away from fanciful experimentation and towards rational, functional, sometimes standardized building. Beyond the Bauhaus, many other significant German-speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school. They also responded to the promise of a \"minimal dwelling\" written into the new [[Weimar Constitution]]. [[Ernst May]], Bruno Taut and [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]], among others, built large housing blocks in [[Frankfurt]] and Berlin. The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns, well-attended public exhibitions like the [[Weissenhof Estate]], films, and sometimes fierce public debate.\n\n=== Bauhaus and Vkhutemas ===\n{{Main|Vkhutemas}}\nThe Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in [[Moscow]], has been compared to Bauhaus. Founded a year after the Bauhaus school, Vkhutemas has close parallels to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner.<ref name=\"GSE\">{{in lang|ru}} ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia; Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya'', [https://archive.today/20050503051137/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/007/304.htm ''\u0412\u0445\u0443\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0441'']</ref> Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge traditional craft with modern technology, with a basic course in aesthetic principles, courses in [[color theory]], industrial design, and architecture.<ref name=\"GSE\" /> Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus,<ref>Wood, Paul (1999) ''The Challenge of the Avant-Garde''.

Swiss painter [[Johannes Itten]], German-American painter [[Lyonel Feininger]], and German sculptor [[Gerhard Marcks]], along with Gropius, comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1919. By the following year their ranks had grown to include German painter, sculptor, and designer [[Oskar Schlemmer]] who headed the theatre workshop, and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]], joined in 1922 by Russian painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. A tumultuous year at the Bauhaus, 1922 also saw the move of Dutch painter [[Theo van Doesburg]] to Weimar to promote ''[[De Stijl]]'' (\"The Style\"), and a visit to the Bauhaus by Russian Constructivist artist and architect [[El Lissitzky]].<ref name=\"foster\">{{cite book |editor=Hal Foster |others=Rosalind Krauss, Yve-Alain Bois, Benjamin Buchloh |title=Art Since 1900: Volume 1 \u2013 1900 to 1944 |year=2004 |publisher=Thames & Hudson |location=New York |isbn=978-0-500-28534-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/artsince1900mode0000unse_u8t1/page/185 185\u2013189] |chapter=1923: The Bauhaus \u2026 holds its first public exhibition in Weimar, Germany |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/artsince1900mode0000unse_u8t1/page/185 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1919 to 1922 the school was shaped by the pedagogical and aesthetic ideas of [[Johannes Itten]], who taught the ''Vorkurs'' or \"preliminary course\" that was the introduction to the ideas of the Bauhaus.<ref name=\"Frampton 1992 124\" /> Itten was heavily influenced in his teaching by the ideas of [[Franz Ci\u017eek]] and [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]]. He was also influenced in respect to aesthetics by the work of the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in [[Munich]], as well as the work of Austrian Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]]. The influence of German [[Expressionism]] favoured by Itten was analogous in some ways to the fine arts side of the ongoing debate. This influence culminated with the addition of [[Der Blaue Reiter]] founding member [[Wassily Kandinsky]] to the faculty and ended when Itten resigned in late 1923. Itten was replaced by the Hungarian designer [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]], who rewrote the ''Vorkurs'' with a leaning towards the New Objectivity favoured by Gropius, which was analogous in some ways to the applied arts side of the debate. Although this shift was an important one, it did not represent a radical break from the past so much as a small step in a broader, more gradual socio-economic movement that had been going on at least since 1907, when van de Velde had argued for a craft basis for design while [[Hermann Muthesius]] had begun implementing industrial prototypes.<ref name=\"foster\" />\n[[File:Joost-schmidt-mechanical-stage-design-1925-1926-ink-and-tempera-on-paper-64-x-44-cm1.jpg|thumb|right|Mechanical Stage Design by [[Joost Schmidt]], 1925]]\nGropius was not necessarily against [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], and in fact, himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this \"new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery\", described \"painting and sculpture rising to heaven out of the hands of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future.\" By 1923, however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring [[Regional characteristics of Romanesque architecture#Romanesque architecture, regional characteristics|Romanesque cathedrals]] and the craft-driven aesthetic of the \"[[V\u00f6lkisch movement]]\", instead declaring \"we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=William |title=Modern Architecture Since 1900 |year=1987 |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=978-0-13-586694-8 |pages=309\u2013316 |chapter=Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus}}</ref> Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called ''[[Bauhaus (magazine)|Bauhaus]]'' and a series of books called \"Bauhausb\u00fccher\". Since the Weimar Republic lacked the number of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labour force and an ability to export innovative and high-quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Bauhaus, 1919\u20131933 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm |website=The MET |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bauhaus |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bauhaus |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nWeimar was in the German state of [[Thuringia]], and the Bauhaus school received state support from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]]-controlled Thuringian state government. The school in Weimar experienced political pressure from conservative circles in Thuringian politics, increasingly so after 1923 as political tension rose. One condition placed on the Bauhaus in this new political environment was the exhibition of work undertaken at the school. This condition was met in 1923 with the Bauhaus' exhibition of the experimental [[Haus am Horn]].<ref>Ackermann et al., ''Bauhaus'' (Cologne: K\u00f6nemann, 1999), 406.</ref> The Ministry of Education placed the staff on six-month contracts and cut the school's funding in half.

After the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, a school of industrial design with teachers and staff less antagonistic to the conservative political regime remained in Weimar. This school was eventually known as the Technical University of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and in 1996 changed its name to [[Bauhaus-University Weimar]].\n[[File:Erich dieckmann, banco per bambini, 1925 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|right|Chair by Erich Dieckmann, 1925]]\n\n=== Dessau ===\n{{Main|Bauhaus Dessau}}\nThe Bauhaus moved to [[Dessau]] in 1925 and new facilities there were inaugurated in late 1926. Gropius's design for the Dessau facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] lines of the [[Fagus Factory]] than the stripped down [[Neoclassical architecture#Regional trends|Neo-classical]] of the Werkbund pavilion or the ''[[V\u00f6lkisch movement|V\u00f6lkisch]]'' Sommerfeld House.<ref>{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=William |title=Modern Architecture Since 1900 |year=2000 |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=978-0-13-586694-8 |page=120 |chapter=Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus}}</ref> During the Dessau years, there was a remarkable change in direction for the school. According to Elaine Hoffman, Gropius had approached the Dutch architect [[Mart Stam]] to run the newly founded architecture program, and when Stam declined the position, Gropius turned to Stam's friend and colleague in the ABC group, Hannes Meyer.\n\nMeyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928,<ref name=\"Artists 2009 pp. 64-66\" /> and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau, and the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer favoured measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of off-the-shelf architectural components to reduce costs. This approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.\n\nBut Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program and forced the resignations of [[Herbert Bayer]], [[Marcel Breuer]], and other long-time instructors. Even though Meyer shifted the orientation of the school further to the left than it had been under Gropius, he didn't want the school to become a tool of left-wing party politics. He prevented the formation of a student communist cell, and in the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse fired him in the summer of 1930.<ref name=\"Etlin2002\">{{cite book |author=Richard A.

Mies was appointed in 1930 and immediately interviewed each student, dismissing those that he deemed uncommitted. He halted the school's manufacture of goods so that the school could focus on teaching, and appointed no new faculty other than his close confidant [[Lilly Reich]].

The students and faculty rehabilitated the building, painting the interior white. The school operated for ten months without further interference from the Nazi Party. In 1933, the [[Gestapo]] closed down the Berlin school. Mies protested the decision, eventually speaking to the head of the Gestapo, who agreed to allow the school to re-open. However, shortly after receiving a letter permitting the opening of the Bauhaus, Mies and the other faculty agreed to voluntarily shut down the school. {{when|date=July 2017}}<ref name=\"Mies\" />\n\nAlthough neither the Nazi Party nor [[Adolf Hitler]] had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, Nazi writers like [[Wilhelm Frick]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] had already labelled the Bauhaus \"un-German\" and criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for communists and social liberals. Indeed, when Meyer was fired in 1930, a number of communist students loyal to him moved to the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nEven before the Nazis came to power, political pressure on Bauhaus had increased. The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its \"[[degenerate art]]\", and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably Jewish, influences of \"cosmopolitan modernism\".<ref name=\"Artists 2009 pp. 64-66\" /> Despite Gropius's protestations that as a war veteran and a patriot his work had no subversive political intent, the Berlin Bauhaus was pressured to close in April 1933.

When Hitler's chief engineer, [[Fritz Todt]], began opening the new [[autobahn]]s (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were \"bold examples of modernism\", and among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.<ref>, Richard J Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'', 325</ref>\n\n== Architectural output ==\nThe paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bauhausmanifesto.com |title= Manifesto of the Staatliches Bauhaus |author=Gropius, Walter |date=April 1919 |work=BauhausManifesto.com}}</ref> the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919\u20131927), he and his partner [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in [[Jena]], and the competition design for the [[Chicago Tribune Tower]], which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 [[Haus am Horn]], student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.\n\nIn the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed \"Laubengangh\u00e4user\" (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer's approach was to research users' needs and scientifically develop the design solution.\n\n[[Mies van der Rohe]] repudiated Meyer's politics, his supporters, and his architectural approach. As opposed to Gropius's \"study of essentials\", and Meyer's research into user requirements, Mies advocated a \"spatial implementation of intellectual decisions\", which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics. Neither Mies van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.\n\nThe popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the T\u00f6rten row housing also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]] and particularly [[Ernst May]], as the city architects of Berlin, [[Dresden]] and [[Frankfurt]] respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in [[Weimar Germany]]. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop [[Onkel Toms H\u00fctte (Berlin U-Bahn)|Onkel Toms H\u00fctte]], is still occupied.\n\n== Impact ==\n[[File:Olivetti-schawinsky-bauhaus-typewriter.jpg|thumb|An [[Olivetti]] Studio 42 [[typewriter]], designed by Bauhausler [[Xanti Schawinsky]] in 1936]]\nThe Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, Canada, the United States and [[Israel]] in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by the Nazi regime.

Gropius and Breuer went on to teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced, among other projects, the [[Aluminum City Terrace]] in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and the [[Alan I W Frank House]] in Pittsburg. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing such students as [[Philip Johnson]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Lawrence Halprin]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], among many others.\n\nIn the late 1930s, [[Mies van der Rohe]] re-settled in Chicago, enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential [[Philip Johnson]], and became one of the world's pre-eminent architects. Moholy-Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the [[New Bauhaus]] school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist [[Walter Paepcke]]. This school became the [[Institute of Design IIT|Institute of Design]], part of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. Printmaker and painter [[Werner Drewes]] was also largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America and taught at both [[Columbia University]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. [[Herbert Bayer]], sponsored by Paepcke, moved to [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], Colorado in support of Paepcke's Aspen projects at the [[Aspen Institute]]. In 1953, [[Max Bill]], together with [[Inge Scholl|Inge Aicher-Scholl]] and [[Otl Aicher]], founded the [[Ulm School of Design]] (German: Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung \u2013 HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus. The school is notable for its inclusion of [[semiotics]] as a field of study. The school closed in 1968, but the \"Ulm Model\" concept continues to influence international design education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/|title=HfG-Archiv Ulm \u2013 The HfG Ulm|first=Ulmer Museum/HfG-Archiv|last=Ulm|website=www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de|access-date=19 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004220616/http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/|archive-date=4 October 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another series of projects at the school were the [[Bauhaus (typeface)|Bauhaus typefaces]], mostly realized in the decades afterward.\n\nThe influence of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus. The structure of the Bauhaus ''Vorkurs'' (preliminary course) reflected a pragmatic approach to integrating theory and application. In their first year, students learnt the basic elements and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented with a range of materials and processes.<ref>Bayer, H., Gropius, W., & Gropius, I. (Eds.). (1975). ''Bauhaus 1919\u20131928''. London: Secker& Warburg.</ref><ref name=\"Itten 1963\">Itten, J. (1963). ''Design and Form: The Basic Course at the Bauhaus and Later'' (Revised edition, 1975). New York: John Wiley & Sons.</ref> This approach to design education became a common feature of architectural and design school in many countries. For example, the Shillito Design School in Sydney stands as a unique link between Australia and the Bauhaus. The colour and design syllabus of the Shillito Design School was firmly underpinned by the theories and ideologies of the Bauhaus. Its first year foundational course mimicked the ''Vorkurs'' and focused on the elements and principles of design plus colour theory and application. The founder of the school, Phyllis Shillito, which opened in 1962 and closed in 1980, firmly believed that \"A student who has mastered the basic principles of design, can design anything from a dress to a kitchen stove\".<ref>O'Connor, Z. (2013). \"The Shillito Design School: Australia's link with the Bauhaus\". ''The International Journal of Design in Society'', 6(3), 149\u2013159.</ref> In Britain, largely under the influence of painter and teacher William Johnstone, Basic Design, a Bauhaus-influenced art foundation course, was introduced at Camberwell School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design, whence it spread to all art schools in the country, becoming universal by the early 1960s.\n\nOne of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of [[modern furniture]] design. The characteristic [[Cantilever chair]] and [[Wassily Chair]] designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer [[Mart Stam]] over patent rights to the cantilever chair design. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus's 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, leading to the patent dispute.) The most profitable product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.\n\nThe physical plant at Dessau survived [[World War II]] and was operated as a design school with some architectural facilities by the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. This included live stage productions in the Bauhaus theater under the name of ''Bauhausb\u00fchne'' (\"Bauhaus Stage\"). After [[German reunification]], a reorganized school continued in the same building, with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/en/|title=Bauhaus Dessau}}</ref> In 1979 Bauhaus-Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.\n\nLater evaluation of the Bauhaus design credo was critical of its flawed recognition of the human element, an acknowledgment of \"the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked by mechanistic views of human nature\u2026Home hygiene without home atmosphere.\"<ref>Schjeldahl, Peter, \"Bauhaus Rules,\" ''The New Yorker'', 16 November 2009</ref>\n\nSubsequent examples which have continued the philosophy of the Bauhaus include Black Mountain College, Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung in Ulm and Domaine de Boisbuchet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boisbuchet.org/interview-with-mathias-schwartz-clauss-boisbuchets-director-and-program-curator/|title=Interview with Mathias Schwartz-Clauss, Boisbuchet\u00b4s director and program curator|date=2019-06-13|website=Domaine de Boisbuchet|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n[[File:Tel-Aviv PinesStreet31 T53.jpg|thumb|A Bauhaus-style building with \"thermometer\" windows on Pines Street in [[Tel Aviv]]]]\n\n=== The White City ===\n{{further|White City (Tel Aviv)}}\n[[White City (Tel Aviv)|The White City]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d4{{lrm}},  refers to a collection of over 4,000 buildings built in the Bauhaus or [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] in [[Tel Aviv]] from the 1930s by [[German Jewish]] architects who emigrated to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] after the rise of the [[Nazis]].

It is a platform for experimentation aiming to unite citizens, experts, businesses and institutions in imagining and designing a sustainable, aesthetic and inclusive future.\n\nSport and physical activity were an essential part of the original Bauhaus approach. Hannes Meyer, the second director of Bauhaus Dessau, ensured that one day a week was solely devoted to sport and gymnastics. 1 In 1930, Meyer employed two physical education teachers. The Bauhaus school even applied for public funds to enhance its playing field. The inclusion of sport and physical activity in the Bauhaus curriculum had various purposes. First, as Meyer put it, sport combatted a \u201cone-sided emphasis on brainwork.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|title=Physical Education at The Bauhaus 1919 33 {{!}} PDF|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/330743705/Physical-Education-at-the-Bauhaus-1919-33|access-date=2022-02-16|website=Scribd|language=en}}</ref> In addition, Bauhaus instructors believed that students could better express themselves if they actively experienced the space, rhythms and movements of the body. The Bauhaus approach also considered physical activity an important contributor to wellbeing and community spirit.
