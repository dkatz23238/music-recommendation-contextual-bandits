According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', he is the best performing male soloist in the history of the [[Mainstream Top 40]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Tennessee]], as a child he appeared on the television shows ''[[Star Search]]'' and ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club#1989\u20131994 revival: The All-New Mickey Mouse Club|The All-New Mickey Mouse Club]]''. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two [[lead vocalist]]s and youngest member of [[NSYNC]], which eventually became one of the [[best-selling]] [[boy band]]s of all time. Timberlake won two [[Grammy Award]]s for his [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-focused debut solo album ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' (2002) and its single \"[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]\". Another single from the album, \"[[Rock Your Body]]\", was also successful.\n\nHis critically acclaimed second album ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'' (2006), characterized by its diversity in music genres, debuted atop the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] consecutive number-one singles with \"[[SexyBack]]\" (featuring [[Timbaland]]), \"[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]\" (featuring [[T.I.]]), and \"[[What Goes Around...

Established as a solo artist worldwide, his first two albums both exceeded sales of 10 million copies, as he continued producing records and collaborating with other artists.\n\nFrom 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus. He held starring roles in the films ''[[The Social Network]]'', ''[[Bad Teacher]]'', ''[[Friends with Benefits (film)|Friends with Benefits]]'', and ''[[In Time]]''.\n\nTimberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'' and ''[[The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2]]'', exploring [[neo soul]] styles, partly inspired by the expansive [[song structure]]s of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the [[List of best-selling albums by year in the United States|best-selling album of the year]] and spawned the top three singles \"[[Suit & Tie]]\" (featuring [[Jay-Z]]) and \"[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]\".
