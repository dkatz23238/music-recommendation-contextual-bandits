Lemmy and Taylor made numerous telephone calls to find a guitarist, including one to [[Brian Robertson (guitarist)|Brian Robertson]], formerly with [[Thin Lizzy]], who was recording a [[solo album]] in Canada. He agreed to help out and complete the tour with them. Robertson signed a one-album deal resulting in 1983's ''[[Another Perfect Day]]'' and the two singles from it, \"[[Shine (Mot\u00f6rhead song)|Shine]]\" and \"[[I Got Mine (Mot\u00f6rhead song)|I Got Mine]]\".<ref name=\"RC1\"/>\n\nIn June and July the band played five dates in Japan, and from mid-October until mid-November they toured Europe.

Before joining Mot\u00f6rhead, Phil Campbell had met former [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] drummer [[Pete Gill]], and the trio decided to call him to see if he would like to visit London. The try-outs went well and Gill was hired.<ref name=\"RC1\"/>\n\nBronze Records thought the new line-up would not make the grade and decided to \"nail down the lid\" on the group with a compilation album. When Lemmy found out, he took over the project, selecting tracks, providing [[Liner notes|sleeve notes]] and insisted that Mot\u00f6rhead record four brand new tracks to go at the end of each side of the album.<ref name=\"RC1\"/> During the sessions between 19 and 25 May 1984 at Britannia Row Studios, London, the band recorded six tracks for the single's B-side and the album.

A week later the band, dressed in tuxedos, played four songs on the live Channel 4 music show ''ECT'' (Extra-Celestial Transmission). To celebrate the band's 10th anniversary, two shows were arranged at [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 28 and 29 June, a video of the second show was taken and later released as ''[[The Birthday Party (video)|The Birthday Party]]''.

The single reached No. 67 and the album reached No. 21 in the UK charts.<ref name=\"Mhcharts\" />\n\nOn 16 August, the band played at the [[Monsters of Rock]] at [[Castle Donington]] and was recorded by BBC Radio 1 for a future ''Friday Rock Show'' broadcast. The performance closed with a flypast by a couple of Second World War German aircraft. Also that day Lemmy was filmed giving his views on spoof metal act \"Bad News\" for inclusion in a [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]] Comic Strip film entitled \"More Bad News\" since the band featuring [[Rik Mayall]], Peter Richardson, [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Adrian Edmondson]] were also performing at Donington.

The band wrote \"[[Eat the Rich (Mot\u00f6rhead song)|Eat the Rich]]\" especially for the film, its soundtrack featured tracks from ''Orgasmatron'' and W\u00fcrzel's solo single \"Bess\". The band's second album for GWR was ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (Mot\u00f6rhead album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'', released on 5 September, after a tight work schedule in the studio. While having some popular tracks and using \"Eat the Rich\" as its second track, the band commented that the album was virtually \"nailed together\".<ref name=\"RC1\"/>\n\nOn 2 July 1988 Mot\u00f6rhead were one of the performers at the [[Giants of Rock]] Festival in [[H\u00e4meenlinna]], Finland. The tracks were released as ''[[No Sleep at All]]'' on 15 October. A single from the album was planned with the band wanting \"Traitor\" as the A-side, but \"[[Ace of Spades (live)|Ace of Spades]]\" was chosen instead. When the band noticed the change, they refused to allow the single to be distributed to the shops, and it was withdrawn and became available only on the \"No Sleep at All\" tour and through the ''Mot\u00f6rheadbangers'' fan club. While they continued to play live shows during 1989 and 1990, Mot\u00f6rhead once again felt unhappy with their career, and a court case with GWR followed, which was not resolved until mid-1990.<ref name=\"RC1\"/>\n\n===Epic/WTG years: ''1916'' and ''March \u00f6r Die'', 1990\u20131992===\nWith the court case resolved, Mot\u00f6rhead signed to [[Epic Records|Epic/WTG]] and spent the last half of 1990 recording a new album and single in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"RC1\"/> Just prior to the album sessions the band's former manager, Doug Smith, released the recording of the band's 10th anniversary show, much against the bands wishes, having previously told him that they did not want it released, in 1986. In the studio they recorded four songs with producer [[Ed Stasium]], before deciding he had to go.\n\nWhen Lemmy listened to one of the mixes of \"Going to Brazil\", he asked for him to turn up four tracks, and on doing so heard [[claves]] and [[tambourine]]s that Stasium had added without their knowledge. Stasium was fired and [[Peter Solley]] was hired as producer. The story according to Stasium was that Lemmy's drug and alcohol intake had far exceeded the limitations of Stasium's patience so he quit.<ref>''White Line Fever'', p. 228.</ref> The single \"[[The One to Sing the Blues]]\" issued on 24 December 1990 (7\" and CD) and 5 January 1991 (12\"), was followed by the album ''[[1916 (album)|1916]]'' on 21 January.

When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:\n\n{{blockquote|No, I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings.

Only two of the original covers for Mot\u00f6rhead's 22 studio albums do not feature any variation of War-Pig on the cover: ''On Parole'' and ''Overnight Sensation'' (of which, ''On Parole'' was never sanctioned by the band), and was in any case reissued with a black Snaggletooth on a white background. Phil is wearing a Snaggletooth badge on the cover of ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]''. The cover of \"Iron Fist\" depicts a metal gauntlet wearing four skull-shaped rings, one of which is Snaggletooth, while the rear of the album-sleeve shows a fully detailed 3-D metal sculpture of the symbol. Originally the Snaggletooth design included a swastika on one of the helmet's spikes. This was painted out on later re-releases of the albums on CD.\n\nOn 21 September 2007, Petagno announced that \"there will be no more \"HEADS\" from my hand\", citing irreconcilable differences between himself and the band's current management, Singerman Entertainment. Petagno stated:\n\n{{blockquote|It has been a long, exciting and industrious journey, full of art and intuition, difference in repetition, and creative innovation. I feel I accomplished something unique in Metal history over the last 31 years by breathing life again and again into a figment of my own imagination, an image or better an entity which has taken on a life of its own, which I actually believe goes beyond the music it was created to represent. I'm damn proud of that!}}\n\nIn reply, Lemmy stated:\n\n{{blockquote|As many of you know, we have been working with Joe Petagno for 31 years. We always treated Joe fairly, and I would like to stress that at no time did my manager demand what Joe thinks he demanded \u2014 it is all a colossal misunderstanding. We have always loved his artwork, obviously, and if he now decides to stop working with us, we have no choice but to use someone else. However ... if he will not discuss this personally and try to work things out, I think it's a great tragedy. If Joe continues with us, no one would be more delighted than me. If it's goodbye, Joe, I wish you well, but I hope, even at this stage, to be reconciled and continue our association.<ref>{{cite web| title=Motorblog: September 2007 | url=http://alanburridge.blogspot.com/2007/09/motorblog-joe-petagno-lemmys-statement.html | work=Joe Petagno \u2013 Lemmy's Statement | publisher=Alan Burridge blog archive |date = 27 September 2007| access-date=9 April 2009}}</ref>}}\n\n==Wrestling==\nMot\u00f6rhead are well known in the [[professional wrestling]] world for performing wrestler [[Triple H]]'s entrance music, \"The Game\", which he has used as his [[entrance music]] since January 2001.<ref name=\"MTV Triple H\">Anderson, Kyle [https://archive.today/2013.06.29-222303/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/03/01/triple-h-motorhead/ \"Triple H Recalls The Beginning Of His Friendship With Mot\u00f6torhead's Lemmy\"].
