Those first three singles reached the first spot in the UK Indie charts, and \"She's a Superstar\" entered the UK Top 75 Singles Chart. The band saw some support from these early days in the United States in some music scenes in big cities like New York connected with psychedelic music.\n\n===''A Storm in Heaven'' (1993\u20131994)===\n1993's ''[[A Storm in Heaven]]'' was the band's full-length debut, produced by record producer [[John Leckie]]. \"[[Blue (The Verve song)|Blue]]\" was released as the lead single and again managed to enter in the UK Top 75 at No.&nbsp;69 and reached No.&nbsp;2 in the Indie charts.

The band departed from the experimental psychedelic sounds of ''A Storm in Heaven'' and focused more on conventional alternative rock, with Ashcroft's vocals taking a more prominent role in the songs, although reminiscent of some of the early work. Around this period, Oasis guitarist and friend of Ashcroft, [[Noel Gallagher]], dedicated the song \"Cast No Shadow\" on the album ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' to Ashcroft, who returned the gesture by dedicating the song \"A Northern Soul\" to Gallagher.\n\nThe band released the album's first single \"[[This Is Music]]\" in May, and it reached No.&nbsp;35, their first single to reach the Top 40. It was followed by \"[[On Your Own (The Verve song)|On Your Own]]\" in June which performed even better, reaching No.&nbsp;28. This single was particularly new for the Verve as it was a soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single \"[[History (The Verve song)|History]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: \"I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because it could have been the greatest time of our lives, with \"History\" doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing.
