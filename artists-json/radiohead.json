Please do NOT change \"ARE\" to \"IS\". Thank you. --> an English rock band formed in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], [[Oxfordshire]], in 1985. The band consists of [[Thom Yorke]] (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers [[Jonny Greenwood]] (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and [[Colin Greenwood]] (bass); [[Ed O'Brien]] (guitar, backing vocals); and [[Philip Selway]] (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer [[Nigel Godrich]] and the cover artist [[Stanley Donwood]] since 1994. Radiohead's [[Experimental music|experimental]] approach is credited with advancing the sound of [[alternative rock]].\n\nAfter signing to [[EMI]] in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single, \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of their debut album, ''[[Pablo Honey]]'' (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose with the release of their second album, ''[[The Bends (album)|The Bends]]'' (1995). Radiohead's third album, ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of [[social alienation|modern alienation]], it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music. ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from [[electronic music]], jazz, classical music and [[krautrock]]. Though ''Kid A'' divided listeners, it later attracted wide acclaim. It was followed by ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'' (2001), recorded in the same sessions.\n\n''[[Hail to the Thief]]'' (2003), with lyrics addressing the [[War on Terror]], was Radiohead's final album for EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, ''[[In Rainbows]]'' (2007), as a [[music download|download]] for which customers could [[Pay what you want|set their own price]], to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, ''[[The King of Limbs]]'' (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive [[Loop (music)|looping]] and [[Sampling (music)|sampling]]. ''[[A Moon Shaped Pool]]'' (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's [[orchestra]]l arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, [[The Smile (band)|the Smile]].\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. [[List of awards and nominations received by Radiohead|Their awards]] include six [[Grammy Awards]] and four [[Ivor Novello Awards]]. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]: \"Creep\" (1992), \"[[Street Spirit (Fade Out)]]\" (1996), \"[[Paranoid Android]]\" (1997), \"[[Karma Police]]\" (1997), \"[[No Surprises]]\" (1998), \"[[Pyramid Song]]\" (2001) and \"[[There There]]\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"[[Nude (song)|Nude]]\" (2008) reached the [[top 40]] on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named Radiohead one of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 greatest artists of all time]], and ''Rolling Stone'' readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] lists, and the band are the most nominated act in [[Mercury Prize]] history, with five nominations.
