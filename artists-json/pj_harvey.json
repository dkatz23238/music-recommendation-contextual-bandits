I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap.

He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's \"disastrous\" debut performance was held at a [[skittles (sport)|skittle alley]] in [[Charmouth]] Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: \"we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left.
