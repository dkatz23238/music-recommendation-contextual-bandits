Beyonc\u00e9 performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as a member of the R&B girl group [[Destiny's Child]], one of the [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups of all time]]. Their hiatus saw the release of her debut album ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003), which featured the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles \"[[Crazy in Love]]\" and \"[[Baby Boy (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Baby Boy]]\".\n\nFollowing the 2006 disbanding of Destiny's Child, Beyonc\u00e9 released her second solo album, ''[[B'Day (Beyonc\u00e9 album)|B'Day]]'', which contained singles \"[[Irreplaceable]]\" and \"[[Beautiful Liar]]\". Beyonc\u00e9 also starred in multiple films such as ''[[The Pink Panther (2006 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (2006), ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' (2006), ''[[Obsessed (2009 film)|Obsessed]]'' (2009), and ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'' (2019). Her marriage to [[Jay-Z]] and her portrayal of [[Etta James]] in ''[[Cadillac Records]]'' (2008) influenced her third album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008), which earned a record-setting [[Grammy Award records#Most Grammys won by a female artist in one night|six Grammy Awards]] in 2010. It spawned the successful singles \"[[If I Were a Boy]]\", \"[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)|Single Ladies]]\", and \"[[Halo (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Halo]]\".\n\nAfter professionally splitting from her manager and father [[Mathew Knowles]] in 2010, Beyonc\u00e9 released her musically diverse fourth album ''[[4 (Beyonc\u00e9 album)|4]]'' in 2011. She later achieved universal acclaim for her sonically experimental visual albums, ''[[Beyonc\u00e9 (album)|Beyonc\u00e9]]'' (2013) and ''[[Lemonade (Beyonc\u00e9 album)|Lemonade]]'' (2016), the latter of which was the world's best-selling album of 2016 and the most acclaimed album of her career, exploring themes of [[infidelity]] and [[womanism]]. In 2018, she released ''[[Everything Is Love]]'', a collaborative album with her husband, Jay-Z, as [[the Carters]]. As a featured artist, Beyonc\u00e9 topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 with the remixes of \"[[Perfect Duet|Perfect]]\" by [[Ed Sheeran]] in 2017 and \"[[Savage (Beyonc\u00e9 remix)|Savage]]\" by [[Megan Thee Stallion]] in 2020. The same year, she released the [[musical film]] and [[visual album]] ''[[Black Is King]]'' to widespread acclaim. In 2022, Beyonc\u00e9 received continued acclaim for her seventh studio album, ''[[Renaissance (Beyonc\u00e9 album)|Renaissance]]'', which experimented with [[disco]] and [[house music]], and took inspiration from [[ball culture]]; she obtained her first solo number-one since 2008 with the album's lead single, \"[[Break My Soul]]\".\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen Bey]]\".<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web|title= Beyonc\u00e9's star formation: from Destiny's Child to Queen Bey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/27/beyonce-star-formation-destinys-child-queen-bey-tour| url-status=live | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211027/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/27/beyonce-star-formation-destinys-child-queen-bey-tour| archive-date=October 27, 2021|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 27, 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> She is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling recording artists]], having sold over 200 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/photos/beyonces-style-evolution-see-photos-1235105288/|title=Beyonc\u00e9's Style Evolution: See Photos|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=June 24, 2022|access-date=September 11, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/protester-follows-beyonce-on-tour-claims-shes-possessed-by-demons/|title=Protester Follows Beyonc\u00e9 On Tour, Claims She's Possessed By Demons|work=[[CBS]]|date=August 29, 2013|access-date=September 11, 2022}}</ref> Her success during the 2000s was recognized with the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)'s Top Certified Artist of the Decade as well as ''Billboard''{{'s}} Top Female Artist of the Decade.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266420/artists-of-the-decade| url-status=live | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211027/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266420/artists-of-the-decade| archive-date=October 27, 2021 |title=Artist of the Decade |magazine=Billboard|date=March 12, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref> She is the first solo artist to have their first seven studio albums debut at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7350372/beyonce-earns-sixth-no-1-album-on-billboard-200-chart-with-lemonade |title=Beyonce Earns Sixth No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart with 'Lemonade' |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |magazine=Billboard |access-date=May 31, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite magazine |last1=Caulfield |first1=Keith |date=August 7, 2022 |title=Beyonce's 'Renaissance' Bows at No. 1 on Billboard 200 With Year's Biggest Debut By a Woman |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/beyonce-renaissance-billboard-200-debut-no-1-1235123568/ |access-date=August 7, 2022 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref> Beyonc\u00e9's [[List of awards and nominations received by Beyonc\u00e9|accolades]] include 28 [[Grammy Awards]], 26 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] (including the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]] in 2014), 24 [[NAACP Image Awards]], 31 [[BET Awards]], and 17 [[Soul Train Music Awards]]; all of which are more than any other singer.
