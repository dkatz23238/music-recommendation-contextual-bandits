In 1992, they dropped the \"Square\" from \"Square Roots\" because a local folk group had claim to the name.\n\nUnable to break through in their native Philadelphia, the band briefly moved to [[London]], where they would release their 1993 debut, ''[[Organix (The Roots album)|Organix]]''. The album was released and sold independently. In the span of a year, the band developed a cult following in Europe, boosted by touring.

The album's opening track features Black Thought introducing the band's sound as \"organic hip hop jazz\"; the album is characterized by a combination of contemporary [[East Coast hip hop]] and [[jazz]] influences, with a heavy reliance on Storch's [[Fender Rhodes]] and the occasional saxophone of guest musician Steve Coleman. The album spawned three singles with accompanying videos: \"Proceed\", \"Distortion to Static\", and \"Silent Treatment\". The album was a moderate hit among [[alternative hip hop|alternative music]] fans, boosted by the group's appearance at [[Lollapalooza]]. In 1995, the band performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. In the years since its release, ''Do You Want More?!!!??!'' has come to be considered to be a classic [[jazz rap]] album.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/the-ten-best-jazz-rap-albums-to-own-on-vinyl/|title=The 10 Best Jazz Rap Albums To Own On Vinyl|website=Vinylmeplease.com|date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The roots-01.jpg|thumb|The Roots in 1999]]\n\nThe 1996 release ''[[Illadelph Halflife]]'' was the group's third album and their first to break the Top 40 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart,<ref name=\"amg\"/> spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\" (a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433815/19970107/roots.jhtml |title=Roots Take A Swing At Video Cliches |date=January 7, 1997 |website=MTV News |access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> and \"Clones\", which was their first single to reach the top five on the rap charts.

Scott Storch left the band and was replaced by a new keyboardist, Kamal Gray. The band's sound would take a darker turn during this period, heavily influenced by [[the Wu-Tang Clan]] and the [[RZA]]'s grimy and haunting production style, replete with samples from old jazz and [[classical music]]. The album is also notable for its many guests and collaborators, including [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], and others.
