With their chart-topping debut release ''[[Beauty and the Beat (The Go-Go's album)|Beauty and the Beat]]'' in 1981, the group helped popularize [[new wave music]] in the United States. The Go-Go's were the first (and to date only) all-female band in history who wrote their own songs and played their own instruments to achieve a No.&nbsp;1 album.

The album marked somewhat of a return to 1960s-influenced music for Carlisle and included songs mainly written and produced by [[Rick Nowels]] but also two songs co-written by Carlisle. The single \"[[Do You Feel Like I Feel?]]\" was accompanied by a video inspired by the [[B movie]] ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]''. The title track, \"[[Live Your Life Be Free]]\", released as first single outside the United States, was a Top 20 hit single in many countries reaching No.&nbsp;12 in the UK<ref name=fullchart/> and No.&nbsp;13 in Australia. Subsequent releases \"[[Half the World (Belinda Carlisle song)|Half the World]]\" and \"[[Little Black Book (song)|Little Black Book]]\" (co-written by [[Marcella Detroit]] under her real name Marcy Levy) were also hits outside the United States. The album was also a success in Europe (Top 10 in the UK and Gold certification). To date, \"Do You Feel Like I Feel?\" is Carlisle's final single to enter in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;73.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\nStill active in Europe and Australia with a record contract at Virgin Records, her 1992 greatest hits album ''[[The Best of Belinda, Volume 1]]'' reached No.&nbsp;1,<ref name=fullchart/> and was certified double platinum in the UK and platinum in Australia. This first greatest hits album included all the hits taken from ''Heaven on Earth'', ''Runaway Horses'', and ''Live Your Life Be Free''. The United States version of the album was named ''Her Greatest Hits'' and also included songs from the first album ''Belinda''.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\nCarlisle's fifth solo album, ''[[Real (Belinda Carlisle album)|Real]]'', was released in 1993 on the Virgin label in the United States and in Europe. Produced without Nowels, the disc was a departure from Carlisle's polished pop music formula. Even the album's [[cover art|cover]] photograph featured her with little or no make-up. Carlisle co-produced and co-wrote much of the album, collaborating heavily with friend and ex-Go-Go [[Charlotte Caffey]]. The album was Carlisle's fifth consecutive to reach the UK Top 10 peaking at number 9.<ref name=fullchart/> It peaked also at number 23 in Sweden.

However, the band broke up again, soon after the promotional [[Concert#Concert tour|tour]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\nCarlisle returned to the recording studio, and resumed working again with [[Rick Nowels]]. In 1996 she released in the UK and Australia her sixth solo album, ''[[A Woman and a Man]]'', on the [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] label. This album, consisting of mostly relaxed [[Adult contemporary music|adult pop]], revitalized her solo career in Europe, and included several hits. The leadoff single, \"[[In Too Deep (Jenny Morris song)|In Too Deep]]\", returned Carlisle to the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 10]] for the first time in six years, reaching No.&nbsp;6. \"[[Always Breaking My Heart]]\", written and produced by [[Roxette]]'s [[Per Gessle]], also made the UK Top 10, peaking at No.&nbsp;8.<ref name=fullchart/>\n\nThe album spawned two further hits in the UK: \"[[Love in the Key of C]]\", and \"[[California (Belinda Carlisle song)|California]]\", which featured arrangement and back-up vocals by [[Brian Wilson]].{{sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=191}} The album reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK,<ref name=fullchart/> and was certified gold. As a result of ''A Woman and a Man''{{'}}s UK success, the album was released in the United States during the summer of 1997 on the small [[Ark 21 Records|Ark21]] label. In 1997, she recorded \"[[I Won't Say (I'm in Love)]]\" for the Disney movie ''[[Hercules (1997 film)#Music|Hercules]]''. The song was released as a single exclusively in France and Germany.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\nIn 1999, Carlisle released a greatest hits album in the UK, a double-disc on the Virgin label, collectively titled ''[[A Place on Earth: The Greatest Hits]]''. The first disc featured Carlisle's hits plus three new tracks recorded for the album: the single \"[[All God's Children (song)|All God's Children]]\", and the songs \"A Prayer for Everyone\" and \"Feels Like I've Known You Forever\". The second disc, subtitled ''A Place on Earth'', contained previously released [[remix]]es of some of her hits and some [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s which had not previously been released on CD. Some of the remixes were by [[William Orbit]]. ''[[A Place on Earth: The Greatest Hits]]'' was certified Gold in the UK and went on to sell in excess of one million copies worldwide. A European version was marketed with an interview CD in which Carlisle provides answers to over 40 questions sent in by fans.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\n===Later recordings and Go-Go's reunions===\n====2001\u20132009====\n[[File:The Go-Gos - Belinda Carlisle, Kathy Valentine and Gina Schock.jpg|thumb|right|Carlisle live with the Go-Go's, Austin, Texas, 2008]]\nIn 2001, the Go-Go's reunited again and released an album of new material, ''[[God Bless The Go-Go's]]''.

Peter Fawthrop of ''AllMusic'' wrote \"Every bit as Go-Go's, that is, as their non-hits and less remarkable material. While the Go-Go's sound is intact, there is not a \"We Got the Beat\" or a \"Head Over Heels\" to be found. It is feasible that in this age of pop rebirth, the Go-Go's decided it was now or never ... The album doesn't attempt to update the band's sound with hip-hop moves or electronic frippery, for which God should bless 'em, indeed.
