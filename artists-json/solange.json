Barb\u00e9, ''Tous les pr\u00e9noms''</ref> (died 10 May, c. 880<ref>The tenth of May is the day she is venerated; the year is an approximation.</ref>) was a [[Franks|Frankish]] [[shepherdess]] and a locally [[venerated]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[saint]] and [[cephalophore]], whose cult is restricted to [[Sainte-Solange]], [[Cher (d\u00e9partement)|Cher]]. Saint Solange was the patron of the traditional [[Berry (province)|Province of Berry]], of which Cher is a part.\n\nSolange was born to a poor, but devout family in the town of Villemont, near [[Bourges]], and consecrated her virginity at the age of seven; according to some, her mere presence cured the sick and [[exorcism|exorcised]] devils. The son of the count of [[Poitiers]]<ref>A name for him, Bernard de la Gothie, or ''Bernard of [[G\u00f6taland|Gothia]]'', refers to a Carolingian name for [[Septimania]].</ref> was highly taken with the beauty and popularity of Solange and approached her when she was tending to her sheep, but she rejected his suit. He argued with her to no avail, and so he decided to abduct her.\n\nAt night, he came and took Solange by force, but she struggled so violently that she fell from his horse while he was crossing a stream. Her abductor grew enraged and beheaded her with his sword. According to the fully-developed legend, Solange's severed head invoked three times the [[Holy Name]] of Jesus, and like [[Saint Denis of Paris|Saint Denis]] and other saints in [[Gaul]]ish territories, Solange picked up her head in her own hands and walked with it as far as the church of Saint-Martin in the village of Saint-Martin-du-Crot (which now bears the name of Sainte-Solange, the only commune in France to bear this name), only dropping truly dead there.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060620021000/http://catholique-bourges.cef.fr/sanctuaires/solange/index.htm Sainte Solange]</ref><ref>[http://carmina-carmina.com/carmina/Mytholosaintes/solange.htm \"Sainte Solange, berg\u00e8re...\"]</ref>\n\n==Veneration==\nImmediately, a cult surrounding her grew up. Many miraculous cures were attributed to her intercession. In 1281, an altar was erected in her honor at that church, and it preserved her severed head as a [[relic]] and began to call itself the church of St. Solange, while a nearby field where she had prayed began to be referred to as the \"Field of St. Solange\". It was a habit of the locals, in times of great stress, to form a procession through Bourges with the reliquary head before them and to invoke her against drought.\n\nSolange's [[feast day]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is May 10.\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Sainte-Solange (CHer, Fr), l'\u00e9glise.JPG|Church of St. Solange.
