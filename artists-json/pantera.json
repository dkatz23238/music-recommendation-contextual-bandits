The group's best-known lineup consisted of the Abbott brothers (drummer [[Vinnie Paul]] and guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]]), along with bassist [[Rex Brown]] and lead vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]]; the former, who joined in 1982, is the sole constant member of Pantera. In addition to their development and popularization of the [[groove metal]] subgenre, Pantera is credited (along with others, such as [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Sepultura]], and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]) for being part of the second wave of [[thrash metal]] scene from the late 1980s to early-to-mid 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/thrash-metal-book-due-in-september/|title='Thrash Metal' Book Due In September|work=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/30-essential-thrash-metal-bands-that-arent-the-big-four|title=30 Essential thrash metal bands that aren't the big four|work=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|loudersound.com]]|access-date=October 22, 2019}}</ref> Pantera is regarded as one of the most successful and influential bands in heavy metal history, having sold around 20 million records worldwide<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">{{cite web|title= Abbott, Vincent Paul [Vinnie Paul] (1964\u20132018) |url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/abbott-vincent-paul-vinnie-paul |date=November 7, 2019|access-date=August 19, 2021}}</ref> and having received four [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nominations.<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 19, 2019|title=Pantera|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/pantera/7936|access-date=October 17, 2020|website=GRAMMY.com}}</ref>\n\nHaving started as a [[glam metal]] band, Pantera released three albums in the mid-1980s with lead vocalist [[Terry Glaze]] (''[[Metal Magic]]'', ''[[Projects in the Jungle]]'', and ''[[I Am the Night (album)|I Am the Night]]''), with little success. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera hired Anselmo in 1986 and released ''[[Power Metal (album)|Power Metal]]'' in 1988. They secured a record deal with major label [[Atco Records|Atco]] the following year. Their fifth album (in which the band has since referred to as their official debut album),<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5099|pure_url=yes}} | title = A short biography on Pantera | work = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = January 3, 2008}}</ref> 1990's ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'', popularized the groove metal genre, while its 1992 follow-up ''[[Vulgar Display of Power]]'' achieved an even heavier sound and increased their popularity.

These tensions resulted in the recording sessions for ''[[The Great Southern Trendkill]]'' (1996) being held separately. The ongoing tension lasted for another seven years, during which only one studio album, ''[[Reinventing the Steel]]'' (2000), was recorded. Pantera went on hiatus in 2001 but lingering disputes led to the band breaking up in 2003. The Abbott brothers went on to form [[Damageplan]] while Anselmo continued to work on several side projects, including [[Down (band)|Down]], which Brown joined as well.\n\nOn December 8, 2004, Dimebag Darrell was [[Columbus nightclub shooting|shot and killed]] on stage by a mentally unstable fan during a Damageplan concert in [[Columbus, Ohio]].

Bradford. In 1982, Hart left the band and Glaze became the group's lead vocalist. Later, Glaze stopped playing rhythm guitar, leaving Darrell as the sole guitarist, doing both lead and rhythm duties. Later that year, Bradford also departed and was replaced by [[Rex Brown]] (then known as Rex Rocker) on bass. \n\nPantera became an underground favorite, though its regional tours in this era never took them beyond [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Louisiana]]. The band began supporting fellow [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]/[[glam metal]] acts such as [[Stryper]], [[Dokken]], and [[Quiet Riot]]. Pantera released their first studio album, ''[[Metal Magic]]'', in 1983. ''Metal Magic'' was released on the band's record label of the same name and produced by the Abbott brothers' father, [[Jerry Abbott]], at Pantego Studios.<ref name=\"MusicMight\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/texas/arlington/pantera |title=Pantera biography |work=[[MusicMight]] |access-date=December 29, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330173817/http://musicmight.com/artist/united%2Bstates/texas/arlington/pantera |archive-date=March 30, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, Pantera released their second studio album, ''[[Projects in the Jungle]]''.

In addition, a music video for the album's lead track, \"All Over Tonight\", was eventually created. ''Projects in the Jungle'' was also released on the band's independent Metal Magic Records label and produced by Jerry Abbott. \n\nIn 1985, Pantera released their third studio album, titled ''[[I Am the Night (album)|I Am the Night]]''. As with ''Projects in the Jungle'', this album saw Pantera's sound becoming heavier (though still rooted in glam metal),<ref name=\"upr\" /> and the heavy metal press took more notice of the band. Because of poor distribution, ''I Am the Night'' turned out to be a costly album to many fans. Around 25,000 copies of the album were sold. Pantera's second music video was produced for the track \"Hot and Heavy\". By 1986, Glaze's glam approach did not fit the band's developing style, and he and the other members parted ways.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Sarah|title=Bowie rocker: \"I want to be doing this forever\"|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/02042010/laurnew113258_32561.php|access-date=January 24, 2017|work=Gazette.net|publisher=Post Community Media LLC|date=February 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1986\u20131989: Anselmo's introduction and ''Power Metal''===\nPantera began a search for Glaze's replacement and initially auditioned Matt L'Amour, a [[David Coverdale]] lookalike.

Pantera showed a more extreme style on this outing, leaving behind its glam metal influences in favor of mid-tempo thrash metal dubbed \"power groove\" (groove metal) by the band. Although Anselmo still used some [[Rob Halford]]-influenced vocals, he also adopted a more abrasive delivery. Darrell's more complex [[guitar solo]]s and [[riff]]s, along with his brother's faster-paced drumwork were evidence of the band's extreme transformation. The album marked a critical juncture in the band's history. Many fans, and the band itself, have referred to ''Cowboys from Hell'' as Pantera's \"official\" debut.<ref name=\"bio\"/> ''Cowboys from Hell'' included the tracks \"[[Cemetery Gates]]\", a brooding seven-minute piece that focuses on death and religion, and the thrashing [[Cowboys from Hell (song)|title track]], which gave the band members their nickname and asserted their raucous personality and style.\n\nTo promote its latest album, Pantera began the ''Cowboys from Hell'' tour alongside thrash acts [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and [[Suicidal Tendencies]]. In 1991, Halford performed with the band onstage, which led Pantera (along with [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]]) to open for [[Judas Priest]] on its first show in Europe. In addition, Halford collaborated with Pantera on the song \"Light Comes Out of Black\", which was featured on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pantera.com/2014/10/17/rob-halford-looks-back-on-doing-light-comes-out-of-black-with-pantera/|work=Pantera Official Website|access-date=July 12, 2022|title=Rob Halford looks back on doing \"Light Comes Out of Black\" with Pantera \u2013 Pantera }}</ref> Pantera also opened for other bands like [[Sepultura]], [[Fates Warning]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]], [[Mind Over Four]], and [[Morbid Angel]], and co-headlined a North American tour with [[Wrathchild America]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metallipromo.com/pantera.html |title=Pantera Tour Dates |publisher=Metallipromo.com |access-date=January 11, 2017}}</ref> The band eventually landed a billing for \"[[Monsters of Rock#Russia|Monsters in Moscow]]\" with [[AC/DC]] and [[Metallica]] in September 1991, where they played to a crowd of over 500,000 in attendance to celebrate the new freedom of performing Western music in the Soviet Union shortly before its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|downfall]] three months later. The band was often found at the Dallas club \"the Basement\", where the band shot the videos for \"Cowboys from Hell\" and \"Psycho Holiday\". Pantera's 2006 home video compilation ''[[3 Vulgar Videos from Hell]]'' features performances of \"Primal Concrete Sledge\", \"Cowboys from Hell\", \"Domination\", and \"Psycho Holiday\" from the show in Moscow.\n\n===1991\u20131995: ''Vulgar Display of Power'' and ''Far Beyond Driven''===\n[[File:Dimebag Darrell with Pantera.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dimebag Darrell performing with Pantera, 1991]]\nPantera's unique \"groove\" style came to fruition with their sixth studio album, titled ''[[Vulgar Display of Power]]'', recorded in 1991 and released on February 25, 1992. On this album, the power metal falsetto vocals were replaced with a hardcore-influenced shouted delivery and heavier guitar sound, which firmly cemented the band's popularity among mainstream and underground fans alike. Two other singles from the album became two of Pantera's most notable ballads: \"[[This Love (Pantera song)|This Love]]\", a haunting piece about lust and abuse, and \"[[Hollow (Pantera song)|Hollow]]\", somewhat reminiscent of \"Cemetery Gates\" from the previous album. The band would play the song \"Domination\" (from ''Cowboys from Hell'') leading into the ending of \"Hollow\" (what is roughly the last 2:30 of the album version), forming a medley referred to as \"Dom/Hollow\", as can be heard on the band's [[Official Live: 101 Proof|1997 live album]]. Singles from ''Vulgar Display of Power'' also received significant airplay on radio as did the companion music videos on [[MTV]]. \"[[Walk (Pantera song)|Walk]]\" became one of the band's more popular songs, and it appeared on the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at the No.&nbsp;35 position. The album itself entered the American charts at No.&nbsp;44.<ref name=\"200chart\"/> Pantera went on tour again, visiting Japan for the first time in July 1992 and later performing at the \"[[Monsters of Rock#1992 2|Monsters of Rock]]\" festival co-headlined by [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Black Sabbath]] in Italy. It was around this time that Darrell Abbott dropped the nickname \"Diamond Darrell\" and assumed \"[[Dimebag Darrell]]\", and [[Rex Brown]] dropped the pseudonym \"Rex Rocker\".\n\nPantera released their seventh studio album, titled ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'', on March 22, 1994, which debuted at No. 1 in both United States<ref name=\"200chart\"/> and Australian album charts. The album's first single, \"[[I'm Broken]]\", earned the band's first [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Grammy nomination for \"Best Metal Performance\"]] in [[Grammy Awards of 1995|1995]]. \"[[Planet Caravan]]\", a Black Sabbath cover which appeared on ''Far Beyond Driven'', was the band's first charting single in the U.S. as it peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Chart]]. The album saw Pantera continue its groove metal approach, while taking an even more extreme direction with its musical style. The album's original artwork (a drill bit impaling an anus) was banned, so it was re-released with the familiar skull impaled with a drill bit. A limited edition was released with a slip-cover case. Also, a boxed set called ''Driven Down Under Tour '94 Souvenir Collection'' was released in Australia and New Zealand to coincide with the tours there. It featured ''Far Beyond Driven'' (with its original banned artwork) with a bonus 13th track, \"The Badge\" (a [[Poison Idea]] cover), the 5-track ''aLIVE and hostile e.p.'', and the Japanese collector's edition ''[[Walk (Pantera EPs)|Walk]]'' EP, all presented in a special cardboard box with an 8-page color biography.\n\nPantera began touring again, starting in South America, along with being accepted into another \"[[Monsters of Rock#1994|Monsters of Rock]]\" billing. In late June, Anselmo was charged with assault for attacking a security guard after he prevented fans from getting on stage.

The rest of the band members first thought that Pantera's perception of his fame had gotten to Anselmo, but Anselmo cited back pain from years of intense performances as the reason for his erratic behavior. Anselmo attempted to alleviate his pain through alcohol, but this, as he admitted, was affecting his performances and \"putting some worry into the band.\"<ref name=\"btm\" /> Doctors predicted that with surgery, Anselmo's back problem could be corrected, but that the recovery time could take up a whole lot more time than before. Unwilling to spend that much time away from the band, Anselmo refused, and began using [[heroin]] as a painkiller.\n\nAnselmo's on-stage remarks became notorious during this time. After stating at a [[Montreal]] concert that \"rap music advocates the killing of white people\", Anselmo denied accusations of racism, and later issued an apology,<ref>{{cite web | last =Shanafelt | first =Steve | title =You'll like them when they're angry | work =Mountain Xpress | date =July 9, 2003 | url =http://mountainx.com/ae/2003/0709superjoint.php | access-date = June 25, 2007}}</ref> stating that he was drunk and that his remarks were a mistake.<ref name=\"MusicMight\" /> In 1995, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Down (band)|Down]], one of Anselmo's many side projects, rose to expectations. Their 1995 debut, ''[[NOLA (album)|NOLA]]'', was a success, but shortly afterwards, the group members returned to their respective bands, leaving Down inactive for several years.\n\nPantera's eighth studio album, ''[[The Great Southern Trendkill]]'', was released on May 7, 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pantera.com/thegreatsoutherntrendkill/|title=The Great Southern Trendkill 1996 \u2013 Pantera|website=pantera.com|access-date=January 25, 2018}}</ref> and is often considered their \"overlooked\" album.<ref name=\"donkaye\" /> Anselmo recorded the vocals for this release in [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]]'s studio in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] while the rest of the band recorded in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], evidence of the continued distancing between Anselmo and the rest of the band. In comparison to the band's previous efforts, there was a heavier emphasis on vocal [[overdub]]bing in a somewhat \"demonic\" fashion. Drug abuse is a recurring theme in ''The Great Southern Trendkill'', as exemplified by tracks such as \"[[Suicide Note (song)|Suicide Note Pt. I]]\", \"[[Suicide Note (song)|Suicide Note Pt. II]]\", \"10's\", and \"Living Through Me (Hell's Wrath)\". \"[[Drag the Waters]]\" became the album's only [[music video]]. The album's other single, \"[[Floods (Pantera song)|Floods]]\", achieved acclaim largely because of Darrell's complex [[guitar solo]] in the song, which ranked No.&nbsp;15 on ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\" of all-time.<ref>{{cite web | title = 100 Greatest Guitar Solos (11\u201320) | work = Guitar World | url = http://guitar.about.com/library/bl100greatesta.htm | access-date = March 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn July 13, 1996, during their tour with [[Eyehategod]] and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2016/08/04/that-tour-was-awesome-pantera-white-zombie-eyehategod-1996/|title=That Tour Was Awesome: Pantera/White Zombie/Eyehategod (1996)|date=August 4, 2016}}</ref> Anselmo overdosed on heroin an hour after a Texas homecoming gig.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/ST/lib00155,0EAF9099EDD696F6.html | title=Pantera singer says he overdosed on heroin |newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] | date=July 18, 1996 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-792332.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011163054/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-792332.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=October 11, 2013 | title=The Heroin Experience; The Drug Has Smacked Into More Than One Generation of Musicians |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=August 11, 1996 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}</ref> After his heart stopped beating for almost five minutes, paramedics gave Anselmo a shot of adrenaline (or possibly [[Narcan]]) and sent him to the hospital.

He also temporarily joined the [[black metal]] supergroup Eibon and contributed vocals to that band's only two songs. Another one of Anselmo's \"Anton Crowley\" projects was black metal band [[Viking Crown]]. The Abbott brothers and Rex Brown began their own [[country rock|country metal]] crossover project, [[Rebel Meets Rebel]] with [[David Allan Coe]], around the same time.\n\nThe band wrote a song for the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Dallas Stars]] during the team's [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1999]] [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Championship run]], \"Puck Off\", which in recent years has been used as the Stars' goal song at [[American Airlines Center]]. Throughout the season, members of the team befriended members of Pantera. During a Stanley Cup party hosted by Vinnie Paul, the [[Stanley Cup]] was damaged when [[Guy Carbonneau]] attempted to throw the Cup from the balcony of Vinnie Paul's house into his pool. The Cup landed short on the concrete deck and had to be repaired by NHL commissioned silversmiths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hookedonhockeymagazine.com/dallas-stars-and-the-mystery-dent-in-the-stanley-cup/|title=The Dallas Stars and the Mystery Dent in the Stanley Cup|date=December 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2K-AS-2iAk|title=Vinnie Paul - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Later on in 1999, Pantera contributed the [[Ted Nugent]] cover \"[[Cat Scratch Fever]]\" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Detroit Rock City (film)|Detroit Rock City]]''. It became the band's second appearance on the Mainstream Rock Chart, peaking at the No.&nbsp;40 position.\n\nPantera returned to the recording studio with Anselmo in 1999, releasing their ninth (considered fifth by the band itself) and final studio album, ''[[Reinventing the Steel]]'', on March 21, 2000. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref name=\"200chart\"/> and included two singles; \"[[Revolution Is My Name]]\" and \"[[Goddamn Electric]]\", the latter of which featured a [[Kerry King]] outro solo recorded backstage in one take during [[Ozzfest]] in Dallas. \"Revolution Is My Name\" became the band's fourth nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] in the [[Grammy Awards of 2001|2001 Grammys]], and it peaked at No.&nbsp;28 on the Mainstream Rock Chart in the U.S..

Following the Extreme Steel tour, a planned tour of Europe was cut short as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]], which left the band stranded in [[Dublin]], Ireland for six days as a result of all flights being canceled. Pantera played their last show in Yokohama, Japan at the \"Beast Feast\" festival on August 28, 2001. This would be the last time the members of Pantera performed together. Back home, the band planned to release its fourth home video in Summer 2002 and record another studio album later that year, but neither came about.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451613/20011226/pantera.jhtml?headlines=true | title=Pantera Members Rip It Up With Rebellious Side Projects|publisher=MTV | date=December 21, 2001 | first=Jon | last=Wiederhorn | access-date = November 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAnselmo again engaged in numerous side projects. In March 2002, [[Down (band)|Down]] released its second studio album, ''[[Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow]]'', which featured Rex Brown on bass following [[Todd Strange]]'s departure in 1999. Brown remained Down's full-time bassist until 2011, having appeared on their [[Down III: Over the Under|subsequent release in 2007]]. Also, in May of that year, Anselmo's [[Superjoint Ritual]] released its debut album, ''[[Use Once and Destroy]]''. Vinnie Paul claimed that Anselmo told him that he would take a year off following the events of September 11, 2001, but Anselmo's touring and recording output for both [[Superjoint Ritual]] and [[Down (band)|Down]] contradicted this. The Abbott brothers were frustrated, and held out for an indefinite period of time, assuming that Anselmo would return. However, according to Anselmo, taking a break from Pantera was a \"mutual thing\" between each of the band members.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=12289 | title = Phil Anselmo speaks on the future of Pantera | date=May 27, 2003 | work = [[Blabbermouth.net]] | access-date = October 17, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe Abbott brothers officially disbanded Pantera in November 2003,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dimebag-darrell-pantera-is-officially-over/|title = DIMEBAG DARRELL: 'PANTERA is Officially Over'|date = November 24, 2003}}</ref> also the year when their [[The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits!|best-of compilation album]] was released, when the Abbott brothers concluded that Anselmo had abandoned them and would not return. The disbandment of the band was not amicable and subsequently a war of words was waged between the former bandmates via the press. Anselmo's comment in a 2004 issue of ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine, saying that Dimebag would \"attack him\" verbally and \"deserves to be beaten severely\", typified Pantera's internal conflicts; Anselmo insisted that this comment was [[tongue-in-cheek]], and he was upset that his comment ended up on the cover of the \"god damn\" magazine.<ref name=\"btm\" /> This explanation was soon dismissed by Vinnie Paul, who said shortly after the 2004 murder of his brother that he had personally listened to the audio files of the interview and that Anselmo had not been misquoted or misrepresented, but said the exact words which appeared in the article.<ref name=\"btm\" /> Caught up in the torrent was Rex Brown, who later said \"It was a bunch of he said, she said nonsense that was going on, and I wasn't going to get in the middle of it.\"<ref name=\"btm\" /> In July 2004, ''Vulgar Display of Power'' went double-platinum, and ''The Great Southern Trendkill'' went platinum the next month.<ref name=\"ussales\" />\n\n===2003\u20132004: Damageplan and the murder of Dimebag Darrell===\n{{Further|Columbus nightclub shooting}}\n[[File:Dimebag 001.jpg|thumb|A fan outside the Alrosa Villa pays tribute to Dimebag Darrell, the main target of Nathan Gale's massacre]]\nAfter Pantera's disbandment, Darrell and Vinnie formed a new band, [[Damageplan]], with vocalist [[Patrick Lachman|Pat Lachman]] and bassist [[Bob Kakaha|Bob Zilla]]. Damageplan released their first and only studio album, ''[[New Found Power]]'', on February 10, 2004. The album was a commercial success; over 44,000 copies were sold in its first week alone and within a year over 100,000 copies were sold, while the album's singles \"Save Me\" and \"Pride\" had appeared on the Mainstream Rock Chart.

Gale also killed fan Nathan Bray, 23, club employee Erin Halk, 29, and Pantera security official Jeff \"Mayhem\" Thompson, 40, and injured longtime Pantera and Damageplan drum technician John \"Kat\" Brooks and Damageplan tour manager Chris Paluska before being shot dead by Columbus police officer James Niggemeyer.<ref name=\"mtvdamageplan\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494653/20041209/damageplan.jhtml?headlines=true | title = Dimebag Darrell, Four Others Killed In Ohio Concert Shooting | work = [[MTV]] | access-date = December 29, 2005}}</ref>\n\nNo motive has been given as to why Gale killed Dimebag Darrell and the other victims, but early theories, which were dismissed by police, suggested that Gale, who was reported to have been diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], was apparently upset over Pantera's breakup.

Dimebag had asked for one of these guitars in 2004, shortly before his death. Eddie Van Halen originally agreed to make Darrell a copy of the guitar, but upon hearing of Abbott's death, offered to place the actual guitar in his casket. Dimebag was buried in a Kiss Kasket (a casket inspired by the band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]). Kiss co-founder [[Gene Simmons]] said, \"There were a limited number made and I sent mine to the family of 'Dimebag' Darrell. He requested in his will to be buried in a Kiss Kasket, as he sort of learned his rock 'n' roll roots by listening to us for some strange reason.\" Not long after Darrell's murder, Anselmo received a heated message from Vinnie, which (according to Anselmo) \"went along the lines that my (Anselmo's) day was coming.\" Anselmo's rebuttal was that everybody's day is coming and that if his day should end before Vinnie's it would not change anything, except for Vinnie to go through \"losing another brother\".\n\nPublic comments made by Anselmo following the shooting suggested that he had considered reuniting with the band prior to Darrell's death.<ref name=\"anselmo\">{{cite web | url = http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=11734 | title = Philip H Anselmo; On Behalf of Darrell Lance Abbott-Pt.

the band played at the second annual Ozzfest in 1997 and the fifth Ozzfest in 2000. Over the course of their career, Pantera's members became known for their excessive partying and debauchery, even acquiring an official drink called the \"Black Tooth Grin\". The \"Black Tooth Grin\" (\"Black Tooth\", \"The Grin\", or \"BTG\", alternatively), named after lyrics from [[Megadeth]]'s \"[[Sweating Bullets (song)|Sweating Bullets]]\", is a mixture of [[Crown Royal]] or [[Seagram|Seagram 7]] [[whisky]] (or both) and [[Coca-Cola]].\n\nPantera also adopted a self-described \"take no shit\" attitude, epitomized in its song \"[[5 Minutes Alone]]\" from the album ''Far Beyond Driven''. According to Vinnie Paul, the song originated when, during a show in [[San Diego, California]], Anselmo was annoyed by a [[heckler]] and encouraged the crowd to beat him up. Consequently, the band was sued by the father of the heckler who said he wanted \"five minutes alone\" with Anselmo to prove who was the \"big daddy\", and Anselmo responded that he would use those \"five minutes alone\" with the father to \"whoop his ass.\"<ref name=\"donkaye\" />\n\nDespite being a standard [[glam metal]] band early in their career, the band members perceive themselves to have subsequently had an uncompromising career in which they never \"[[selling out|sold out]]\" or gave into trends. This is most noticeably highlighted in the themes and title of ''The Great Southern Trendkill''. Anselmo said:\n\n{{quote|We've survived every fucking trend\u2014[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], \"[[grunge metal]]\", [[funk metal]], [[rap metal]]\u2014and we're still here. We put everyone on notice that we don't fuck around.

As a tribute, Pantera has recorded three different covers of Black Sabbath songs (all from the [[Ozzy Osbourne]] era). The first was \"[[Planet Caravan]]\", a slower, quieter song planned for the first Sabbath tribute album, ''[[Nativity in Black]]'', that eventually became the final track on ''Far Beyond Driven''. The band performed Sabbath's \"Electric Funeral\" on the second ''Nativity in Black''. A previously unreleased cover of Sabbath's \"[[Hole in the Sky (song)|Hole in the Sky]]\" was included on the band's 2003 compilation album, ''The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits!'' Pantera's affinity for Black Sabbath is also shown through the lyrics, \"Your trust is in whiskey and weed and Black Sabbath\", in \"Goddamn Electric\". The same song also mentions [[Slayer]], one of the band's thrash metal influences.\n\n===Comparisons with Exhorder===\nThe New Orleans band [[Exhorder]] have suggested that Pantera copied their sound during the change from glam metal to groove metal. Pantera's ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'', marking a major stylistic shift, was released just before Exhorder's debut, ''[[Slaughter in the Vatican]]''. However Exhorder self-released two [[demo (music)|demos]] in the late 1980s (around the time that Pantera was still playing [[glam metal]]). Exhorder's members allege Pantera copied these demos.<ref>{{cite web |title=Former Exhorder Frontman: 'Did Pantera Rip Us Off?

In disagreement with the opinion that Exhorder is \"Pantera minus the good songs\", AllMusic's review of ''Slaughter in the Vatican'' expresses that \"perhaps a more accurate billing would be to call them Pantera without the major label backing.\" In explaining Exhorder's much less successful career, AllMusic also point to the fact that the title of their debut, along with the blatantly provocative album cover, \"certainly didn't help [their] cause any.\"<ref name=\"exhorder\">{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6976|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Slaughter in the Vatican'' review | work = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = October 21, 2005}}</ref>\n\nHowever, some critics dispute any notion that Pantera imitated Exhorder's sound. Brian Davis, a contributor to [[Internet radio]] station [[KNAC]], addresses the issue as follows:\n\n{{quote|Exhorder's main \"claim to fame\" is the common opinion that they're the band that Pantera stole their sound from. That's total bullshit.
