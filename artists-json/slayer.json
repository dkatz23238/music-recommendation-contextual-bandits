The band was formed in 1981 by guitarists [[Kerry King]] and [[Jeff Hanneman]], drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] and bassist/vocalist [[Tom Araya]]. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the \"big four\" bands of [[thrash metal]], alongside [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. Slayer's final lineup comprised Araya, King, drummer [[Paul Bostaph]] (who replaced Lombardo in 1992 and again in 2013) and guitarist [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] (who replaced Hanneman in 2011). Drummer [[Jon Dette]] was also a member of the band.\n\nIn the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as [[serial killer]]s, [[torture]], [[genocide]], [[organized crime]], [[secret society|secret societies]], [[occultism]], [[terrorism]], [[religion]] or [[antireligion]], [[fascism]], [[racism]] and [[war]], have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups. However, its music has been highly influential, being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' (1986), has been described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.\n\nSlayer released twelve studio albums, three live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received [[RIAA certification|gold certification]] in the United States. Slayer sold 5 million copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and over 20 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hypebeast.com/2016/11/10-facts-about-slayer |title=10 Slayer Facts to Know Before Copping the Supreme Collaboration |work=Hypebeast |date=November 7, 2016 |access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/slayer-guitarist-jeff-hanneman-dies-451113 |title=Slayer Guitarist Jeff Hanneman Dies at 49 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 2, 2013 |access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref> The band has received five [[Grammy Award]] nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \"[[Eyes of the Insane]]\" and one in 2008 for the song \"Final Six\", both of which were from the album ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' (2006).

In January 2011, he contracted [[necrotizing fasciitis]], which severely restricted his ability to perform. He appeared publicly with the band on only one known occasion, playing two songs during an encore at one of Slayer's Big 4 performances in April 2011; he also attended rehearsals for [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]] in November 2011, but did not end up performing at this show. By July 2012, Hanneman had not written or recorded any new material for the band's follow up to 2009's ''World Painted Blood''.<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Appleford| first = Steve| title = Slayer Ramp Up Work on New Album| magazine = [[Rolling Stone]]| publisher = [[Wenner Media]]| date = July 6, 2012| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/slayer-ramp-up-work-on-new-album-20120706| access-date = July 7, 2012| archive-date = July 8, 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120708225529/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/slayer-ramp-up-work-on-new-album-20120706| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Slayer's Kerry King Talks Upcoming Album, Jeff Hanneman's Health In New Video Interview| work = [[Blabbermouth.net]]| publisher = [[Roadrunner Records]]| date = July 5, 2012| url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=176373| access-date = July 7, 2012| archive-date = November 3, 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121103181652/http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=176373| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Ramirez| first = Carlos| title = Slayer Release Statement Updating the Health Status of Jeff Hanneman| work = [[Noisecreep]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = May 1, 2012| url = http://www.noisecreep.com/2012/05/01/slayer-jeff-hanneman/| access-date = July 7, 2012}}</ref> In February 2013, Kerry King stated he was planning on recording all of the guitar parts for the upcoming album himself, but was open to Hanneman's return if he was willing and able.
