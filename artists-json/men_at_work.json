Its founding member and frontman is [[Colin Hay]], who performs on lead vocals and guitar. After playing as an acoustic duo with [[Ron Strykert]] during 1978\u20131979, Hay formed the group with Strykert playing bass guitar and [[Jerry Speiser]] on drums. They were soon joined by [[Greg Ham]] on flute, saxophone, and keyboards and John Rees on bass guitar, with Strykert switching back to lead guitar. The group was managed by Russell Depeller, a friend of Hay, whom he met at [[La Trobe University]]. This line-up achieved national and international success during the early to mid 1980s. \n\nIn January 1983, they were the first Australian artists to have a simultaneous No.&nbsp;1 album and No.&nbsp;1 single on the United States ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts: ''[[Business as Usual (Men at Work album)|Business as Usual]]'' (released on 9 November 1981) and \"Down Under\" (1981), respectively. With the same works, they achieved the distinction of a simultaneous No.&nbsp;1 album and No.&nbsp;1 single on the Australian, New Zealand, and United Kingdom charts. Their second album ''[[Cargo (album)|Cargo]]'' (2 May 1983) was also No.&nbsp;1 in Australia, No.&nbsp;2 in New Zealand, No.&nbsp;3 in the US, and No.&nbsp;8 in the UK. Their third album ''[[Two Hearts (Men at Work album)|Two Hearts]]'' (3 April 1985) reached the top&nbsp;20 in Australia and top&nbsp;50 in the US.\n\nThey won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1983, they were inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] in 1994, and they have sold over 30 million albums worldwide. In May 2001, \"Down Under\" was listed at No.&nbsp;4 on the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs]] and ''Business as Usual'' appeared in the book ''[[100 Best Australian Albums]]'' (October 2010).\n\nIn 1984, Speiser and Rees were asked to leave the group, leaving Hay, Ham, and Strykert. During the recording of the ''Two Hearts'' album, Strykert decided to leave. Soon after the release of ''Two Hearts'', Ham left also, leaving Hay as the sole remaining member. From 1996 until 2002 Hay and Ham toured the world as Men at Work. On 19 April 2012, Ham was found dead at his home from an apparent heart attack.<ref name=\"Pena\">{{citation |title=Remembering Greg Ham: 1953\u20132012 |last=Pena |first=Shirley |work=examiner com |date=19 April 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Hay revived the Men at Work moniker and began touring with the assistance of a backing band including none of the other original members.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe nucleus of Men at Work formed in Melbourne around June 1979 with [[Colin Hay]] on lead vocals and guitar, Ron Strykert on bass guitar, and [[Jerry Speiser]] on drums. They were soon joined by [[Greg Ham]] on flute, sax and keyboards, and then John Rees on bass guitar, with Strykert switching to lead guitar.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Hay had emigrated to Australia in 1967 from Scotland with his family.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> In 1978, he had formed an acoustic duo with Strykert, which expanded by mid-1979 with the addition of Speiser. Around this time as a side project, keyboardist Greg Sneddon (ex-Alroy Band).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Best Music\"/> a former bandmate of Jerry Speiser, together with Speiser, Hay and Strykert performed and recorded the music to 'Riff Raff\", a low budget stage musical, upon which Sneddon had worked.\n\nHay asked Greg Ham to join the group, but Ham hesitated, as he was finishing his music degree.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Ultimately, he decided to join the band in October 1979. John Rees, a friend of Jerry, joined soon after. The name Men At Work was thrown into the hat by Colin Hay, and was seconded by Ron Strykert, when a name was required to put on the blackboard outside The Cricketer's Arms Hotel, [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]].<ref name=\"Contraband\"/> The band built a \"grass roots\" reputation as a [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] band.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> In 1980, the group issued their debut single, \"Keypunch Operator\" backed by \"[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]\", with both tracks co-written by Hay and Strykert.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"APRA Down\"/> It was \"self-financed\" and appeared on their own independent, M. A. W. label.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], felt the A-side was \"a fast-paced country-styled rocker with a clean sound and quirky rhythm\".<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Despite not appearing in the top&nbsp;100 on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart,<ref name=\"Kent\"/> by the end of that year the group had \"grown in stature to become the most in-demand and highly paid, unsigned band of the year\".<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\n===International success - ''Business as Usual'' and ''Cargo'' (1981\u20131983)===\nEarly in 1981 Men at Work signed with CBS Records, the Australian branch of CBS Records International, (which became Sony Music) on the recommendation of Peter Karpin, the label's [[Artists and repertoire|A&R person]].<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> The group's first single with CBS Records in Australia \"[[Who Can It Be Now?]]\", was released in June 1981 which reached No.&nbsp;2 and remained in the chart for 24&nbsp;weeks.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> It had been produced by United States-based Peter McIan, who was also working on their debut album, ''[[Business as Usual (Men at Work album)|Business as Usual]]''.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/>\n\nMcIan, together with the band worked on the arrangements for all the songs that appeared on ''Business As Usual''. Their next single was a re-arranged and \"popified\" version of \"Down Under\". It appeared in October that year and reached No.&nbsp;1 in November, where it remained for six&nbsp;weeks.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> ''Business as Usual'' was also released in October and went to No.&nbsp;1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, spending a total of nine&nbsp;weeks at the top spot.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> ''[[The Canberra Times]]''{{'}} Garry Raffaele opined that it \"generally stays at a high level, tight and jerky ... There is a delicacy about this music \u2014 and that is not a thing you can say about too many rock groups. The flute and reeds of Greg Ham do much to further that\".<ref name=\"Raffaele\"/> McFarlane noted that \"[a]side from the strength of the music, part of the album's appeal was its economy. The production sound was low-key, but clean and uncluttered. Indeed, the songs stood by themselves with little embellishment save for a bright, melodic, singalong quality\".<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nBy February the following year both \"Down Under\" and ''Business as Usual'' had reached No.&nbsp;1 on the respective [[Official New Zealand Music Chart]]s<ref name=\"NZ Charts\"/> \u2013 the latter was the first Australian album to reach that peak in New Zealand.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Despite its strong Australian and New Zealand showing, and having an American producer (McIan), ''Business as Usual'' was twice rejected by Columbia's US parent company.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Thanks to the persistence of Russell Depeller and Karpin, the album was finally released in the US and the United Kingdom in April 1982 \u2013 six months after its Australian release.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Their next single, \"[[Be Good Johnny]]\", was issued in Australia in April 1982 and reached No.&nbsp;8 in Australia,<ref name=\"Kent\"/> and No.&nbsp;3 in New Zealand.<ref name=\"NZ Charts\"/>\n\nMen at Work initially broke through to North American audiences in the western provinces of Canada with \"Who Can It Be Now?\" hitting the top&nbsp;10 on radio stations in [[Winnipeg]] by May 1982. It peaked at No.&nbsp;8 on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'' Top Singles]] Chart in July.<ref name=\"CAN Singles\"/> In August the group toured Canada and the US to promote the album and related singles, supporting [[Fleetwood Mac]].<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> The band became more popular on Canadian radio in the following months and also started receiving top&nbsp;40 US airplay by August.<ref name=\"Billboard Magazine\"/> In October \"Who Can It Be Now?\" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name=\"AMG Charts\"/> while Canada was one single ahead with \"Down Under\" topping the Canadian charts that same month.<ref name=\"CAN Singles\"/> In the following month ''Business as Usual'' began a 15-week run at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=\"AMG Charts\"/>\n\nWhile \"Who Can It Be Now?\" was still in the top&nbsp;ten in the US, \"Down Under\" was finally released in that market.

''Cargo'' appeared at No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name=\"AMG Charts\"/> and No.&nbsp;8 in the UK.
