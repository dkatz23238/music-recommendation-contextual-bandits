Since 1992, the lineup has consisted of [[Ira Kaplan]] (guitars, piano, vocals), [[Georgia Hubley]] (drums, piano, vocals), and [[James McNew]] (bass, vocals). In 2015, original guitarist [[Dave Schramm (musician)|Dave Schramm]] rejoined the band and appears on their fourteenth album, ''[[Stuff Like That There (Yo La Tengo album)|Stuff Like That There]]''.\n\nDespite achieving limited mainstream success, Yo La Tengo has been called \"the quintessential critics' band\" and maintains a strong cult following.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Though they mostly play original material, the band performs a wide repertoire of [[Cover versions|cover songs]] both in live performance and on record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/albums/yo-la-tengo-7bd6ae90.html|title=Yo La Tengo Album Statistics |website=Setlist.fm|access-date=December 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early history, 1984\u201385===\n[[Ira Kaplan]] and [[Georgia Hubley]] formed the band as a couple in 1984. They chose the name Yo La Tengo, Spanish for \"I have it\". The name came from a baseball anecdote that occurred during the 1962 season, when [[New York Mets]] [[center fielder]] [[Richie Ashburn]] and [[shortstop]] [[Elio Chac\u00f3n]] found themselves colliding in the outfield. When Ashburn went for a catch, he would scream, \"I got it! I got it!\" only to run into Chac\u00f3n, a [[Venezuela]]n who spoke only Spanish. Ashburn learned to yell, \"Yo la tengo! Yo la tengo!\" instead. In a later game, Ashburn happily saw Chac\u00f3n backing off. He relaxed, positioned himself to catch the ball, and was instead run over by left fielder [[Frank Thomas (NL baseball player)|Frank Thomas]], who understood no Spanish and had missed a team meeting that proposed using the words \"Yo la tengo!\" as a way to avoid outfield collisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yolatengo.com/kaplanskorner.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090711024319/http://www.yolatengo.com/kaplanskorner.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 11, 2009 |title=Kaplan's Korner, Episode 1 |publisher=Yolatengo.com |access-date=February 17, 2012 }}</ref> After getting up, Thomas asked Ashburn, \"What the hell is a yellow tango?\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Fran|last=Zimniuch|title=Richie Ashburn Remembered|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|date=2005|pages=41\u201342}}</ref>\n\nKaplan and Hubley placed an advertisement to recruit other musicians who shared their love for bands such as [[the Soft Boys]], [[Mission of Burma]], and [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]]'s [[Love (band)|Love]].<ref name=AllMusic /> The group's debut recording was a [[7\"]] single entitled \"The River of Water\" backed with a cover of Lee's \"A House Is Not a Motel\", released in late 1985 with [[Dave Schramm (musician)|Dave Schramm]] on lead guitar and [[Dave Rick]] on bass. After recording \"Private Doberman\" for inclusion on a Coyote Records compilation entitled ''Luxury Condos Coming to Your Neighborhood Soon'', Rick left the band and was replaced by Mike Lewis, the founding bass player of Boston garage-punk bands [[DMZ (band)|DMZ]] and [[Lyres (band)|Lyres]], who was also a member of Brooklyn [[garage rock]] band [[the A-Bones]] throughout his tenure in YLT.\n\n===Early releases, 1986\u201389===\nIn 1986, Yo La Tengo released their first LP, ''[[Ride the Tiger (album)|Ride the Tiger]]'' on Coyote Records. Produced by former [[Mission of Burma]] bassist [[Clint Conley]] who also took over bass duties on three songs, the album \"marked Yo La Tengo as a band with real potential\" according to reviewer Mark Deming.<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r22470 |label=''Ride the Tiger'' Yo La Tengo > Review |first=Mark |last=Deming |access-date=11 August 2009 }}</ref> Kaplan was credited as \"naive guitar\" on the sleeve, and in the liner notes for the 1993 reissue of the album on [[City Slang Records]], went so far as to say \"Dave's guitar playing is inarguably the best thing about the record.\"\n\nSchramm and Lewis left the band after the album's release, with Kaplan subsequently taking on the role of lead guitar and Stephan Wichnewski joining to play bass. The group's next album ''[[New Wave Hot Dogs]]'' (1987) sold poorly, but, in the words of Mark Deming, \"was a quantum leap over the sound of their debut.\"<ref name=AllMusic />\n\nThe release of ''[[President Yo La Tengo]]'' in 1989 did much to establish the band's reputation among rock critics including [[Robert Christgau]] who praised the \"mysterioso guitar hook\" in the first song titled \"Barnaby, Hardly Working\".<ref name=\"robertchristgau.com\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Robert Christgau]] |first=Robert |last=Christgau |title=Yo La Tengo > Consumer Guide Reviews |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Yo+La+Tengo |access-date=11 August 2009 }}</ref> Produced by Gene Holder of [[The dB's]], the album was the band's last release on Coyote. Despite the positive reception of the album, sales were still poor and Wichnewski left the band not long after. Hubley and Kaplan carried on as a duo and began playing two-electric-guitar shows. Kaplan, though typically a pragmatist, started carrying a bug trapped in amber in his pocket for luck.\n\n===Bar/None and Alias Records, 1990\u201392===\nYo La Tengo reunited with Dave Schramm in 1990 to record ''[[Fakebook (album)|Fakebook]]'', an album of mostly [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] tunes, including [[cover version|covers]] of [[Cat Stevens]], [[Gene Clark]], [[the Kinks]], [[Daniel Johnston]], among others, with five original songs by the band themselves, including an acoustic version of ''Barnaby Hardly Working''. Again produced by Gene Holder, the album's [[Folk music|folk]] sound was a change of pace for the band. Years later, Kaplan recalled that the album was \"just me and Georgia looking for an excuse to record with Dave Schramm and Al Greller\" who played guitar and [[double bass]] on the album, respectively.<ref name=\"drownedinsound.com\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Drowned in Sound]] |date=June 12, 2009 |first=Andrzej |last=Lukowski |title=Popular Condo Meltdown: catching up with Yo La Tengo |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137093-popular-condo-meltdown--catching-up-with-yo-la-tengo |access-date=11 August 2009 |archive-date=2015-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710164203/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137093-popular-condo-meltdown--catching-up-with-yo-la-tengo |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, with Dave Schramm in tow, Yo La Tengo collaborated with [[Daniel Johnston]] on the song \"Speeding Motorcycle\" which was released as a single. The band also released a 7\" single on [[Bar/None Records]] with the song \"Walking Away from You\" backed with a cover of [[Beat Happening]]'s \"Cast a Shadow.\" Gene Holder produced the single and played the bass. The ''That Is Yo La Tengo'' EP released later that year included some tracks that would end up on the group's next LP.\n\nAfter the release of ''That Is Yo La Tengo'', [[James McNew]] (who also records under the solo moniker [[Dump (band)|Dump]]) began playing bass with the band, forming the trio that continues to make up the band today. According to McNew,{{cquote|I originally signed on as a fill-in for a short US tour, and a 4-week summer tour of Europe with Eleventh Dream Day.

Three of the album's eleven songs (\"Swing for Life\", \"Out the Window\" and \"Five-Cornered Drone\") were carried over from the ''That Is Yo La Tengo'' EP and feature Holder on bass. The ''Upside-Down'' EP was released on CD in support of the album, rounding out the band's releases on Alias.\n\n===Early Matador period, 1993\u20132000===\nIn 1993, Yo La Tengo began their partnership with [[Matador Records]], releasing a 7\" and CD5 of the song \"Shaker\" which the band recorded with John Siket in New Jersey. The following LP, 1993's ''[[Painful (album)|Painful]]'', was also the beginning of the band's fruitful creative partnership with producer Roger Moutenot, who has produced all of their subsequent albums up until 2013's ''[[Fade (Yo La Tengo album)|Fade]]'', which was produced by [[John McEntire]]. ''Painful'' is the first Yo La Tengo album to feature James McNew on every song. Ira Kaplan explains:{{cquote|I think this group really started when we made the record ''Painful''. . . . ''Painful'' was the first record that we made as the three of us, and I think it sounds different from the things that came before it. Even though I can see connections with the earlier records and things we've done since, it really seems like mostly we've built on that record. Anything from before then is really, really different to me. Since ''Painful'', I think we've gotten more confident and more willing to trust ourselves and trust each other, and probably better at dealing with things that go wrong.<ref>{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Noel |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/ira-kaplan,32860/ |title=Ira Kaplan &#124; Music &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

Critical reaction was extremely positive; [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] awarded the album a 9.7 out of 10,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/23364-i-can-hear-the-heart-beating-as-one |title=Record Reviews: I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One |date=February 14, 2008 |access-date=February 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214070901/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/23364-i-can-hear-the-heart-beating-as-one |archive-date=February 14, 2008 }}</ref> and [[AllMusic]] reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it was \"arguably Yo La Tengo's finest and most coherent album to date.\"<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r260270 |label=''I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One'' Yo La Tengo > Review |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |access-date=11 August 2009 }}</ref> Kaplan recalled a turning point in the band's musical progression:{{cquote|I think after ''Electr\u2013O-Pura'' we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album is going to sound like.

In 1998, they collaborated with [[Jad Fair]] and released the album ''[[Strange but True (album)|Strange but True]]'' to mixed reviews. Yo La Tengo had a cameo role as a [[Salvation Army]] band in the 1998 [[Hal Hartley]] film ''[[The Book of Life (1998 film)|The Book of Life]]'', and feature on its 1999 soundtrack release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halhartley.com/shop/product/details/1947/the-book-of-life-soundtrack|title=halhartley.com|access-date=2018-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317164910/http://halhartley.com/shop/product/details/1947/the-book-of-life-soundtrack|archive-date=2018-03-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band entered the studio again in late 1999 to record their ninth LP. ''[[And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out]]'' was released in February 2000 to a warm reception.

The band also released an EP with covers of [[Sun Ra]]'s \"Nuclear War\" in late 2002.\n\nThe band's tenth LP, ''[[Summer Sun]]'', was released in 2003.
