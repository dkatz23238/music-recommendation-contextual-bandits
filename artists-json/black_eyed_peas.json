Actor [[David Faustino]] opened an all-ages club named Balistyx in 1991 inside the old [[Whisky a Go Go]], and Tribal Nation played there. Rapper [[Eazy-E]] caught their show and signed the group to [[Ruthless Records]], changing the group name to [[Atban Klann]]. Their first album project, ''Grass Roots'', was shelved at the end of 1993, never to be released. They released a promo song \"Let Me Get Down\" in 1994, billed as being produced by the Black Eyed Peas: the production team of DJ Motiv8 and Will 1X.

The album's first single, \"[[Don't Phunk with My Heart]]\", was a hit in the U.S., reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This ''Billboard'' status was the highest peak yet of their career in the U.S. (this was later broken when \"[[Boom Boom Pow]]\" peaked at the top spot of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and earned them another Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. The song reached three in the UK, and five in Canada, and stayed at number one for three weeks in Australia.

It reached number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content.
