Erroneously Collins states, \"the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it ''nirvana''.\"{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=137\u2013138}} This may have been deliberate use of words in early Buddhism, suggests Collins, since Atman and Brahman were described in Vedic texts and Upanishads with the imagery of fire, as something good, desirable and liberating.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=216\u2013217}} Collins says the word ''nirv\u0101\u1e47a'' is from the verbal root {{transl|sa|v\u0101}} \"blow\" in the form of past participle {{transl|sa|v\u0101na}} \"blown\", prefixed with the preverb {{transl|sa|nis}} meaning \"out\". Hence the original meaning of the word is \"blown out, extinguished\". ([[Sandhi]] changes the sounds: the ''v'' of {{transl|sa|v\u0101na}} causes {{transl|sa|nis}} to become {{transl|sa|nir}}, and then the ''r'' of {{transl|sa|nir}} causes [[retroflexion]] of the following ''n'': ''{{transl|sa|nis}}+{{transl|sa|v\u0101na}}'' > ''nirv\u0101\u1e47a'').{{sfn|Collins|2010|pp=63-64}} However the Buddhist meaning of nirvana also has other [[Nirvana_(Buddhism)#Etymology|interpretations]].\n\n[[L.
