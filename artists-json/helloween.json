Its first lineup consisted of singer and guitarist [[Kai Hansen]], bassist [[Markus Grosskopf]], guitarist [[Michael Weikath]] and drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]]. By the time Hansen quit Helloween in 1989 to form [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], the band had evolved into a five-piece, with [[Michael Kiske]] taking over as lead vocalist. Schwichtenberg and Kiske both parted ways with Helloween in 1993; Schwichtenberg died two years later as the result of suicide. Between then and 2016, there had been numerous line-up changes, leaving Grosskopf and Weikath as the only remaining original members. As a septet, their current lineup includes four-fifths of the ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I|Keeper of the Seven Keys: Parts I]]'' and ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II|II]]''-era (1987\u20131988) lineup, featuring three additional members, vocalist [[Andi Deris]] (who had replaced Kiske in 1994), guitarist [[Sascha Gerstner]] and drummer [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]].\n\nSince its inception, Helloween has released 16 studio albums, three live albums, three EPs and 30 singles, was honored with 14 gold and six platinum awards and has sold more than ten million records worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HELLOWEEN \u2013 Nuclear Blast|url=https://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/about/70954.helloween.html|access-date=30 June 2021|website=nuclearblast.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://helloween.org/band/history.html|title=Helloween: Band History|access-date=29 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530002931/http://helloween.org/band/history.html|archive-date=30 May 2015}}</ref> Helloween has been referred to as the \"fathers of [[power metal]]\", as well as one of the so-called \"big four\" of the genre's early German scene, along with [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]], [[Rage (German band)|Rage]] and [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bnrmetal.com/v5/band/band/Hell|title=The BNR Metal Pages \u2013 Helloween|website=bnrmetal.com|access-date=10 May 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Helloween {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/helloween-mn0000957340/biography|access-date=30 June 2021|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Helloween Family Tree|url=https://www.givememetal.com/powermetaltrees/helloween-family-tree|access-date=30 June 2021|website=The Metal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=20 July 2016|title=Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time|url=https://loudwire.com/top-metal-bands-of-all-time/|access-date=30 June 2021|website=[[Loudwire]]}}</ref> and as one of power metal \"big four\" overall, along with [[Blind Guardian]], [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]] and [[DragonForce]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blum|first=Jordan|title=The 'Big 4' Bands of 17 Metal Subgenres|url=https://loudwire.com/big-4-bands-metal-subgenres/|access-date=17 December 2021|website=[[Loudwire]]}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years and first album (1984\u20131986) ===\nHelloween was formed 1984 in [[Hamburg]], West Germany. The original line-up included [[Kai Hansen]] on vocals and rhythm guitar, [[Michael Weikath]] on lead guitar, [[Markus Grosskopf]] on bass and [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] on drums. That year, the band signed with [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise Records]] and recorded two songs for a Noise compilation record called ''[[Death Metal (Split album)|Death Metal]]''. The compilation featured the bands [[Hellhammer]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and Dark Avenger. The two tracks were \"Oernst of Life\" by Weikath and Hansen's \"Metal Invaders,\" a faster version of which would appear on the band's first full-length album.\n\nHelloween recorded and released its first record in 1985, a [[Helloween (EP)|self-titled]] EP containing five tracks. Also that year, the band released its first full-length album, ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]''. During the following concert tour, Hansen had difficulties singing and playing the guitar at the same time. Hansen's last recording as the band's lead singer was in 1986 on a vinyl EP titled ''Judas'', which contained the song \"Judas\" and live versions of \"Ride the Sky\" and \"Guardians\" recorded at Gelsenkirchen. (The CD edition has the live introduction, but the songs have been replaced with studio versions and crowd noise spliced in.) Following these releases, Helloween began the search for a new vocalist.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 April 2021|title=metal-rules.|url=https://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/GammaRay_KaiHansen.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHansen said in an interview 1999: {{cquote|''\"We wanted to go for a lot more intricate stuff on the guitar and more technical. So it was like getting harder and harder for me without having big experience on vocals. I never had lessons or anything and I was not that fixed on the guitar yet so it was getting difficult. On the other hand we thought it would be really cool to have a real front man, a real singer. We heard Queensryche, the first album that they did, and we thought wow that would be cool to have a singer like that who could be very stable on the high soaring notes and have a lot of expression.\"''}}\n\n=== ''Keeper of the Seven Keys'' (1986\u20131989) ===\nThe band found an 18-year-old vocalist, [[Michael Kiske]], from a local Hamburg band named Ill Prophecy. Kiske was initially uninterested in them, having heard the more thrashy ''Walls of Jericho'', but after Weikath insisted, he attended one of their sessions and heard some songs they had composed for his voice (songs which would later be featured in their next albums), and he changed his mind.<ref name=\"RCinter\">{{cite web |last1=Dutra |first1=Daniel |title=HELLOWEEN \u2013 O pai de todos |url=https://roadiecrew.com/helloween-o-pai-de-todos/ |website=Roadie Crew |access-date=5 July 2021 |language=Portuguese |date=10 June 2021}}</ref>\n\nWith their new lead vocalist in tow, Helloween approached record labels Noise International and RCA and proposed the release of a double-LP to introduce the line-up. This proposition was turned down.\n\nInstead, they recorded a single LP, ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I]].'' The album was released by Noise Records on 23 May 1987, months after the band spent the winter of 1986 into 1987 hard at work inside Horus Sound Studio in Hannover, Germany. It consisted of songs mostly written by Hansen. Due to guitarist Michael Weikath's illness, he was recovering from a nervous breakdown, all the rhythm guitars on the album were played by Hansen. Weikath was only able to play some guitar solos and only wrote the ballad \"A Tale That Wasn't Right\". Weikath said in an interview: \"I was pleased to still be in the band.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 April 2021|title=Dave Ling Michael Weikath Interview 14 november 2005|journal=Classic Rock/Metal Hammer Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe album received great reviews from the press and a great response from the fans. The positive reception took Helloween across the ocean, as they toured the US together with [[Grim Reaper (band)|Grim Reaper]] and [[Armored Saint]]. Their American distributor at the time, RCA, got them to record a video for the epic ''\"Halloween\"'', but cut it to four minutes so that the video can be played on [[MTV]]. However, after the European tour together with [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], the first struggles within the band started taking shape.\n\nExhausted from touring, Hansen asked the band to take a short break from live performances. However, as the band was just starting to gain momentum the time to take a break was just not right. The disputes ranged from arguing about their musical direction on the future releases to extensive touring and other, mostly insignificant topics. Hansen started contemplating leaving the band.\n\nIn August 1988, Helloween released ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II]].'' This time the record featured more Weikath-penned tracks. The idea behind this was that the first album should feature tracks written by Hansen due to their similarity to the style of their debut, while the second album would feature tracks composed by Weikath which were a lot more mainstream by comparison. The album capitalized on the success of Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 1 and picks up where it left off. Success bloomed all over Europe, Asia and even the US. The album went gold in Germany, reached #108 in the US, hit the UK top 30 albums and single \"''[[Dr. Stein|Dr Stein]]\"'' reached the lofty heights of #57.\n\nDespite the vast commercial success of the Keeper's part two, the rift between the band members kept growing. They spent more time arguing about the music rather than composing it. Hansen called for a meeting and once again asked the band if they could take a break from touring.\n\nThe band got the chance to perform, in front of 100.000 people, as a part of the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival along with [[Iron Maiden]], [[David Lee Roth]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Guns N' Roses]] at [[Donington Park]] on 20 August 1988.\n\nAround the same time, the tension between the band and their record label Noise led to an argument which would later lead to a lawsuit. The band was discontent with how much they were being paid taking into account great record and merchandise sales, as well as frequent touring. Helloween also supported Iron Maiden on their [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour]], on some dates in Europe.\n\nIn the fall of 1988, the band went on yet another European tour, now as headlining act, named \"Pumpkins Fly Free Tour\", which spawned their first ever live album, released the year after, titled \"''[[Live in the U.K.]]''\" recorded during their show in Scotland. The same record was also released as \"''Keepers Live''\" in Japan and \"''I Want Out Live''\" in the US.\n\nMTV put the single \"[[I Want Out (Helloween song)|I Want Out]]\" into heavy rotation. A video that was directed by [[Storm Thorgerson]]. In Hansen's ''I Want Out'' the guitarist very publicly laid out his disillusion with life as a member of Helloween at this time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/helloween-were-not-as-big-as-maiden-but-were-way-bigger-than-spinal-tap|title=Helloween: \"We're not as big as Maiden, but we're way bigger than Spinal Tap\"|first=Dave Everley21|last=June 2017|website=Classic Rock Magazine|date=21 June 2017|access-date=19 July 2021}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|''\"It was a statement, yeah,\" Hansen says. \"It wasn't just wanting out of the band, it was a general thing relating to everything that was going on: poor management, other people telling us where to be and what to do, never-ending internal discussions\u2026 I just wanted to rock.\"''}}\n\nIn support of its ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' show, MTV also presented the Headbangers Ball Tour in US and invited Helloween to be a part of it in 1989. However, before the start of that tour, in December 1988 Kai Hansen broke the news to the other members that he was leaving Helloween. Hansen's last show with the band was at [[O2 Academy Birmingham|The Hummingbird]], Birmingham, UK on 8 November 1988.\n\n=== Hansen and Kiske's departures (1989\u20131993) ===\nHelloween chose [[Roland Grapow]] to replace Hansen.\n\nGrapow was originally discovered in a club in Hamburg, Germany playing with his band Rampage. Helloween guitarist Michael Weikath, who kept Grapow's name in mind in the event Hansen would potentially leave.\n\nGrapow, who was a [[Auto mechanic|car mechanic]] at the time, stated in 2017 that, if Weikath had not happened to ask him to join the band, he would have kept his job and given up on his dream of becoming a professional musician.<ref>{{cite web|title=ROLAND GRAPOW Says HELLOWEEN Doesn't Want Him To Take Part In 'Pumpkins United' Tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/roland-grapow-says-helloween-doesnt-want-him-to-take-part-in-pumpkins-united-tour/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=20 August 2017|access-date=19 October 2017}}</ref> Grapow said in 2020: {{cquote|\n\"''Weikath called me in August 88 with the question if I was still playing guitar, because he saw me at a Rampage show, He asked me if I'd like to join Helloween after they will finish the European tour, because Kai wanted to leave the band\u2026so I started learning the songs and in December I was playing five songs with them at the rehearsal room. Some weeks later I was already on tour in America with them and then we went to Japan after that.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musikholics.com/masterplan-and-former-helloween-guitarist-roland-grapows-interview/|title=MusikHolics \u2013 Masterplan and former Helloween guitarist Roland Grapow's interview|website=Musikholics.com|date=30 December 2020|access-date=19 July 2021}}</ref>}}\n\nThe inaugural [[Headbangers Ball Tour]] started in April 1989 with Helloween joining [[San Francisco Bay Area]] thrash-metal band [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] in support of headlining act [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tosse2.se/helloween_tour.htm|title=Helloween|website=Tosse2.se|access-date=19 July 2021}}</ref> The band was slotted in the prestigious second spot, right before Anthrax's set. On the heels of this exposure to U.S. audiences, the band achieved worldwide success. Kiske reflected at the time: {{cquote|''\"I can see why it made sense for us to get involved with MTV but I really don't think we fit this bill at all. We're playing our hardest songs every night, but we're not thrash.\"''}}\n\nAt the height of their success Helloween decided to sign with then-major label EMI after being urged to do so by their management company Sanctuary, who also managed [[Iron Maiden]]. Their former label [[Noise Records]] sued them for breach of contract which effectively put the band on hold. Between June 1989 and April 1992 they did not play one show. All the momentum the band had built up came to a halt.\n\nTheir first album with new guitarist Grapow ''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' was released on EMI in the spring of 1991 in Europe and Japan. In the rest of the world as well as the band's home country Germany the album was delayed until April 1992 due to the ongoing legal battle between the band's current and former labels. By that time the music landscape had changed drastically. It also did not help that Helloween moved even further away from their speed metal roots and further embrace the hard rocking side of their sound. As a result, ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' failed commercially and tensions started to build amongst the band members.<ref name=\"official\">{{cite web|title=Official Helloween Website: History |url=http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |access-date=17 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415013244/http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |archive-date=15 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThey played their first show on their \"Quick Hello Tour\" in Hamburg 30 April 1992 and continued with some more dates in Europe and the band also went to Japan in the autumn of 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 July 2021|title=Helloween tour|url=http://tosse2.se/helloween_tour.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Helloween Tour Book|year=1992}}</ref>\n\nThe follow-up ''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' was released on EMI in the summer of 1993. The very experimental album was a commercial failure. The band's diversion away from the sound that had made them famous alienated a large portion of their fanbase.\n\nThe original drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg was then fired from the band due to his deteriorating mental state.<ref name=\"official\" /> {{cquote|''\"We started to notice something was wrong with him when we were on tour, with all that road pressure\"'' remembers Weikath. ''\"Ingo had a strange behavior... he did strange things and we noticed something was seriously wrong with him. We lived with him and we could see his changes\".''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kingofdrums.net/biography.php|title=Memory of Ingo Schwichtenberg|website=Kingofdrums.net|access-date=19 July 2021}}</ref> }}\n\nGrosskopf said 1996: {{cquote|''\"It was like he had two people in his mind: the good and the evil. He told me the evil was always talking to him. It was very strong in him, he was very depressed. We decided to give him professional help, 'cause we could not help him. It was too serious.\"''}}\n\nSchwichtenberg could not be part of the band anymore until he recovered from drugs and alcohol abuse and took his medications against [[schizophrenia]]. After a long telephone call with Weikath, in which he explained why they had made that hard and painful decision, Schwichtenberg was asked to leave Helloween.\n\nHe was replaced by session drummer Ritchie Abdel-Nabi on a temporary basis to finish the ''Chameleon'' Tour. Also many of the European dates were cancelled. Helloween played in half-filled venues and their decision to focus the setlist mostly on ''Chameleon'' and ''Pink Bubbles'' songs did not help either.\n\nWeikath said 1994 about Kiske and the ''Chameleon'' Tour: {{cquote|\"''During that tour we played seven concerts and cancelled the rest. Kiske said he had a throat illness, but we all thought it was panic. Your voice disappears when you are frightened or on panic. It looked like he just stayed static on stage, and when I said to him to move and give a better impression to the audience, he said that I was diminishing his authority on stage. I didn't find that fun, because he did his acts on stage, and they weren't spontaneous like before, he was just standing still to sing better, and that showed us that the songs from \"Chameleon\" weren't good for shows. I understand, the album could be interesting, but on the eyes of the fans we weren't able to play it live. It was like rice for us: Sticky, but not tasty!\"''<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.truemetal.org/kaleidoscope/abouthim/interview06.html|title=Kaleidoscope \u2013 Roland Grapow's Official Homepage \u2013 Intermission Interview|website=Truemetal.org|access-date=19 July 2021}}</ref> }}\n\nMeanwhile, the conflicts within the rest of the band worsened and the decision was made to fire Kiske. His last performance with the band was at a Charity show at [[Rockfabrik Ludwigsburg]] 22 December 1993, until he returned to the stage with Helloween 24 years later.\n\nKiske did not have any contact with Grosskopf and Weikath for many years. He would later release soloalbums with different musical directions. In 2008, Kiske released ''[[Past in Different Ways]]''; an album featuring most of his old Helloween songs, albeit rearranged and re-recorded acoustically. Commenting on Kiske's dismissal, Grosskopf later said:<ref name=\"MRmarkus\">{{cite web|last1=Syrjala|first1=Marko|title=Helloween \u2013 bassist Markus Grosskopf|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2011/01/11/helloween-bassist-markus-grosskopf/|website=[[Metal Rules]]|access-date=31 May 2015|date=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|''\"People thought we were crazy for firing a singer like Kiske, but then after all those years and listening to what he's doing now I hope people will understand why we did that decision. Otherwise he would have pushed us into the direction where he is going now and we didn't want that.\"''}}\n\n1993 would come to a close for Helloween with no singer, no drummer, and no record contract (EMI released the band from its agreement for the low sales numbers for ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' and ''Chameleon'').\n\nWeikath said 1994: {{cquote|''\"Well, EMI said we didn't sell enough records for their taste. They had to pay a lot of pre-production costs and sadly we weren't able to sell enough albums for them to have their money back. The fans were disappointed. First with \"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\", and now with \"Chameleon\". We still sold 400.000 copies of \"Chameleon\", but we made a deal with EMI and changed our label.\"''<ref name=\"auto\" />}}\nGrosskopf continued: {{cquote|''\"That was a time when nobody understood each other. There was too much arguing. Someone wanted it this way, the other wanted that way. We didn't have anything to lose. The three of us sat down and decided to begin again.\"''}}\n\n=== First years with Andi Deris and return to the roots (1994\u20132000) ===\nHelloween returned in 1994 with former [[Pink Cream 69]] frontman [[Andi Deris]] as their new lead vocalist and [[Uli Kusch]], formerly of Kai Hansen's [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], on drums. The band already knew Deris from some recording sessions in Hamburg, though both Deris and new drummer Uli Kusch played on the band's next album Master Of The Rings, which was released on 8 July 1994, they were temporary members of the band back during the recording sessions, but they eventually became permanent members of the band on 1 September 1994.<ref name=MRmarkus /> He had been approached by Weikath to join the band in 1991, but he had declined, despite being intrigued by the offer and having to deal with emerging conflicts between him and his band. In the years since, however, Kiske was fired from Helloween and the issues within Pink Cream 69 worsened. Faced with the inevitability of his firing, Deris accepted Weikath's offer during a night out with the band members.<ref name=MRmarkus /> With this new lineup and a new record contract with Castle Communications, Helloween released its comeback album, ''[[Master of the Rings]]''.\n\n8 March 1995, original drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in his native Hamburg. In the years since his departure from Helloween, Schwichtenberg had gotten worse from schizophrenia. 1996's ''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' was dedicated to his memory.\n\nFollowing another world tour, a double live album called ''[[High Live]]'' was released. In 1998, Helloween released ''[[Better Than Raw]]'', one of the band's heaviest albums since the full-length debut. The subsequent supporting tour was made up of stops in Europe, Japan and Brazil, but on 20 December 1998, the band visited New York and played a show at the venue Coney Island High in Manhattan, the first show for Helloween in the United States in nearly a decade.\n\nThe band would follow ''Better Than Raw'' with a 1999 release titled ''[[Metal Jukebox]]'', a cover-album featuring Helloween's versions of songs from such bands as [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Faith No More]], [[The Beatles]], [[ABBA]] and [[Deep Purple]].\n\n=== Line-up changes (2002\u20132004) ===\n2000 saw the release of ''[[The Dark Ride]]'', a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. It came complete with downtuned guitars and a gruffer singing style from Deris. Immediately following the tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch.<ref name=MRmarkus /> One version of events states that Weikath, Deris and Grosskopf felt that Kusch and Grapow, in particular, were spending more time on and paying more attention to their new side-project, [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] (Grapow's output on Helloween albums had dropped to barely one song per album by that point); since the others believed that Kusch and Grapow were not one hundred percent dedicated to Helloween, they were dismissed.\n\nThey were replaced by guitarist [[Sascha Gerstner]] (ex-[[Freedom Call]], Neumond) and drummer [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]] (ex-[[Metalium]], [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], [[At Vance]], [[Firewind]]), culminating with the recording of another studio album, titled ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'', in 2003. The band met Gerstner via a recommendation by producer [[Charlie Bauerfeind]]. According to Grosskopf, one day he was recording something with Freedom Call \"and later on we called him up and he went to first meet Weiki because it was very important that Weiki finds a player that he can play with and also communicate and understand. [...] So we got him on the island where we recorded and let him hang out with us a little and then he decided 'Good, let's go'.\"<ref name=MRmarkus /> Later in 2012, on an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, Grapow stated:\n\n{{cquote|I felt very secure in Helloween. In the middle of the tour I said something to Michael and Markus and I said my opinion about something. I wanted to make something the best for the band and I think they misunderstood me, like I wanted to be leader. I was telling the truth and that's how I am... It was a great time in Helloween... but I am happy when I left the band after Dark Ride because it's one of my favourite albums, it changed my life totally.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=MASTERPLAN's Roland Grapow \u2013 \"I Think HELLOWEEN Would Be Much Bigger If They Would Continue with the Style of Keepers Albums\"; New Audio Interview Online|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/193811|access-date=16 November 2012|newspaper=BW&BK|date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Interview With MASTERPLAN Mainman And Ex-HELLOWEEN Roland Grapow|url=http://metalshockfinland.com/2012/11/15/interview-with-masterplan-mainman-and-ex-helloween-roland-grapow/|last=Fayyazi|first=Mohsen|date=15 November 2012|publisher=Metal Shock Finland|access-date=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nCross could not finish the album due to [[EBV infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], completing only two tracks; the drum tracks were completed by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]'s [[Mikkey Dee]]. [[Stefan Schwarzmann]], former drummer of [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and [[Accept (band)|Accept]] would shortly thereafter take over the drumming duties. Despite a somewhat tepid response to the album, Helloween nonetheless completed a successful world tour, highlighted by the return of classic songs such as \"Starlight\", \"Murderer\", and \"Keeper of the Seven Keys\" to the setlist. Additionally, the band toured the United States for the first time since 1989, playing to sold-out crowds at nearly every venue.\n\n=== Steady line-up (2005\u20132016) ===\n[[File:Helloween - Live in N\u00fcrnberg - L\u00f6wensaal - 18.01.2006.jpg|thumb|Helloween in 2006]]\n[[File:2011-08 Woodstock 56.jpg|thumb|Helloween at [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2011]]\n2005 saw yet another line-up change, following the \"Rabbits on the Run\" tour, as it became apparent that Helloween and Stefan Schwarzmann did not share the same musical vision. As further noted by the band, he had some trouble performing fast drum parts,<ref name=MRmarkus /> so he was replaced by [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]], the former drummer of German metal band Rawhead Rexx. A change in record company also followed as they inked a deal with German label [[SPV GmbH|SPV]]. Any fears that what had now become a revolving door of band members would affect the quality of their new album were laid to rest as Helloween's new studio album, titled ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys \u2013 The Legacy]]'', was released on 28 October 2005 in Germany and 8 November in the US to commercial and critical acclaim. The album had a pre-release single, \"[[Mrs. God]]\", as well as a video for the track. The track \"[[Light the Universe]]\" was released as a single on 22 November, featuring [[Candice Night]] of [[Blackmore's Night]] on guest vocals. She also appears in the video clip for that track.\n\nIn late 2006, Helloween filmed and recorded shows in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] (Brazil), [[Sofia]] (Bulgaria) and Tokyo (Japan) for their live album ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys \u2013 The Legacy World Tour 2005/2006]]''. The DVD also featured extra footage of the band, as well as interviews and a road movie. This was the second Helloween live album to feature Andi Deris as frontman and third overall. It enjoyed chart success in several countries: Germany: 9 (DVD) & 58 (CD), Sweden: 9 (DVD), France: 10 (DVD)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |title=HELLOWEEN: 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys' Live DVD/CD Chart Positions Revealed |publisher=BlabberMouth |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310175150/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |archive-date=10 March 2007  }}</ref>\nHelloween has since completed their studio album ''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'', which was released on 23 October 2007.
