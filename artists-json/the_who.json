Their classic lineup consisted of lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]], guitarist and singer [[Pete Townshend]], bass guitarist and singer [[John Entwistle]], and drummer [[Keith Moon]]. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th&nbsp;century, and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the [[Marshall Stack]], large [[public address system|PA systems]], the use of the [[Algorithmic composition|synthesizer]], Entwistle and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's [[Guitar feedback|feedback]] and [[power chord]] guitar technique, and the development of the [[rock opera]]. They are cited as an influence by many [[hard rock]], [[punk rock]], [[power pop]] and [[mod (subculture)|mod]] bands, and their songs are still regularly played. The Who were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1990. \n\nThe Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the [[pop art]] and [[mod (subculture)|mod movements]], featuring [[auto-destructive art]] by [[Instrument destruction|destroying guitars and drums]] on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\" (1965), reached the UK top&nbsp;ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including \"[[My Generation]]\" (1965), \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\" (1966) and \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and released \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", their only US top&nbsp;ten single. The group's 1969 [[concept album]] ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'' included the single \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" and was a critical and commercial success.\n\nFurther festival appearances at [[Woodstock]] and the [[Isle of Wight Festival|Isle of Wight]], along with the concert album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to ''Tommy'', ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', was abandoned. Songs from the project made up ''[[Who's Next]]'' (1971), including the hits \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\", \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\", and \"[[Behind Blue Eyes]]\". The group released another concept album, ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film adaptation of ''Tommy'']] (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of ''[[Who Are You]]'' (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.\n\n[[Kenney Jones]] replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a [[Quadrophenia (film)|film adaptation of ''Quadrophenia'']] and the retrospective documentary ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as [[Live Aid]] in 1985, a 25th&nbsp;anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of ''Quadrophenia'' in 1996\u20131997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer [[Zak Starkey]]. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]''.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, [[Pino Palladino]] on bass, and Pete's brother [[Simon Townshend]] on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2019, the group released the album [[Who (album)|''Who'']] and toured with a symphony orchestra.\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\n[[File:TVU Campus St Marys Road.jpg|thumb|[[Pete Townshend]] attended [[Ealing Art College]] (pictured in 2010), and his experience there contributed to the Who's career.|alt=Photograph of Ealing Art College in 2010]]\n\nThe founding members of the Who, [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Pete Townshend]] and [[John Entwistle]], grew up in [[Acton, London]] and went to [[Acton High School|Acton County Grammar School]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=13, 19, 24}} Townshend's father, [[Cliff Townshend|Cliff]], played saxophone and his mother, Betty, had sung in the entertainment division of the [[Royal Air Force]] during World War II, and both supported their son's interest in [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=15\u201316}} Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County, and formed a [[trad jazz]] group;{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} Entwistle also played [[French horn]] in the Middlesex Schools' Symphony Orchestra. Both were interested in rock, and Townshend particularly admired [[Cliff Richard]]'s d\u00e9but single, \"[[Move It]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} Entwistle moved to guitar, but struggled with it due to his large fingers, and moved to bass on hearing the guitar work of [[Duane Eddy]]. He was unable to afford a bass and built one at home.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=29}}{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} After Acton County, Townshend attended [[Ealing Art College]],{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=20}} a move he later described as profoundly influential on the course of the Who.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}}\n\nDaltrey, who was in the year above, had moved to Acton from [[Shepherd's Bush]], a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in at the school, and discovered gangs and rock and roll.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=14}} He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=11}} In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to evolve into the Who. The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well as the music.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=31}}\n\nDaltrey spotted Entwistle by chance on the street carrying a bass and recruited him into the Detours.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} Daltrey on lead guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals.  The band played instrumentals by [[the Shadows]] and [[the Ventures]], and a variety of pop and trad jazz covers.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=19}} Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, \"ran things the way he wanted them\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by [[Doug Sandom]], though he was older than the rest of the band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nDawson left after frequently arguing with Daltrey{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} and after being briefly replaced by Gabby Connolly, Daltrey moved to lead vocals. Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=21}} who started booking the band as a support act. The Detours were influenced by the bands they supported, including [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], [[Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers]], [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]], and [[Johnny Kidd and the Pirates]]. The Detours were particularly interested in the Pirates as they also only had one guitarist, [[Mick Green]], who inspired Townshend to combine rhythm and lead guitar in his style.  Entwistle's bass became more of a lead instrument,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=24}} playing melodies.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=65}} In February 1964, the Detours became aware of the group Johnny Devlin and the Detours and changed their name.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=26}} Townshend and his house-mate Richard Barnes spent a night considering names, focusing on a theme of joke announcements, including \"No One\" and \"the Group\". Townshend preferred \"the Hair\", and Barnes liked \"the Who\" because it \"had a pop punch\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=65}} Daltrey chose \"the Who\" the next morning.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=66}}\n\n=== 1964\u20131978 ===\n==== Early career ====\n[[File:Quadrophenia exhibit 2.jpg|alt=Several scooters on a display|thumb|The Who's aesthetic grew out of [[Mod (subculture)|mod subculture]] with its high fashion, scooters for transport, and shaggy hairstyles.]]\nBy the time the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, including at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=68}} They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for [[Fontana Records]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=70}} Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not speak to each other again for 14 years.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nDuring a gig with a stand-in drummer in late April at the Oldfield, the band first met Keith Moon. Moon grew up in [[Wembley]], and had been drumming in bands since 1961.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=29}} He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=80}} Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=73}} Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nThe Who changed managers to [[Peter Meaden]]. He decided that the group would be ideal to represent the growing [[mod (subculture)|mod]] movement in Britain which involved fashion, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] and music genres such as [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[Bebop|Modern Jazz]].

The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=125}} and [[auto-destructive art]] became a feature of the Who's live set.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=126}}\n\n==== First singles and ''My Generation'' ====\n[[File:The Who in 1965.png|left|thumb|Promotional shot of the Who, 1965]]\nBy late&nbsp;1964, the Who were becoming popular in London's [[Marquee Club]], and a rave review of their live act appeared in ''[[Melody Maker]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=134}} Lambert and Stamp attracted the attention of the American producer [[Shel Talmy]], who had produced [[the Kinks]]. Townshend had written a song, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", that deliberately sounded like the Kinks to attract Talmy's attention. Talmy saw the group in rehearsals and was impressed. He signed them to his production company,{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} and sold the recording to the US arm of [[Decca Records]], which meant that the group's early singles were released in Britain on [[Brunswick Records]], one of UK Decca's labels for US artists.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=151\u2013152}} \"I Can't Explain\" was recorded in early November 1964 at Pye Studios in [[Marble Arch]] with [[The Ivy League (band)|the Ivy League]] on backing vocals, and [[Jimmy Page]] played [[fuzz guitar]] on the B-side, \"Bald Headed Woman\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=60}}\n\n\"I Can't Explain\" became popular with [[pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=152}} Pirate radio was important for bands as there were no commercial radio stations in the UK and [[BBC Radio]] played little pop music.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=100}} The group gained further exposure when they appeared on the television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''<ref name=\"eder\" /> Lambert and Stamp were tasked with finding \"typical teens\", and invited the group's regular audience from the Goldhawk Social Club.<ref name=\"carr\">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Kids are Alright (soundtrack)|publisher=Polydor|year=1979|first=Roy|last=Carr}}</ref> Enthusiastic reception on television and regular airplay on pirate radio helped the single slowly climb the charts in early 1965 until it reached the top 10.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=419}} In early 1965, The Who made their first appearance on the television music show, ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', at the [[BBC]]'s [[Dickenson Road Studios]] in [[Manchester]], with \"I Can't Explain\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Humphries |first1=Patrick |title=Top of the Pops 50th Anniversary |date=28 November 2013 |publisher=McNidder and Grace Limited |isbn=978-0-85716-063-8 |page=52 |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Top_of_the_Pops_50th_Anniversary/tMscAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT52&printsec=frontcover |access-date=29 May 2022 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe follow-up single, \"[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\", by Townshend and Daltrey,{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}} features guitar noises such as [[Pick slide|pick sliding]], toggle switching{{sfn|Aledort|1994|p=58}} and [[audio feedback|feedback]], which was so unconventional that it was initially rejected by the US arm of Decca. The single reached the top&nbsp;10 in the UK{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}} and was used as the theme song to ''Ready Steady Go!''{{sfn|Aledort|1994|p=57}}\n\nThe transition to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did not sit well with Daltrey, and a recording session of R&B covers went unreleased.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=121}} The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the [[West End of London]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=126}} The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's [[amphetamine]]s down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=93}} but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership.

Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it was turned into a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle. The song used gimmicks such as a vocal [[stutter]] to simulate the speech of a mod on [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]], and two [[Modulation (music)|key changes]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=182}} Townshend insisted in interviews that the lyrics \"Hope I die before I get old\" were not meant to be taken literally.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=x}} Peaking at No.&nbsp;2, \"My Generation\" is the group's highest-charting single in the UK.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=419}} The debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' was released in late 1965.

Townshend said he wrote the song about identity crisis, and as a parody of [[the Rolling Stones]]'s \"[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]\". It was the first single to feature him playing an acoustic [[twelve-string guitar]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=200\u2013201}} Talmy took legal action over the B-side, \"[[Instant Party]]\", and the single was withdrawn. A new B-side, \"Waltz for a Pig\", was recorded by the [[Graham Bond]] Organisation under the pseudonym \"the Who Orchestra\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=203}}\n\nIn 1966 the Who released \"[[I'm a Boy]]\", about a boy dressed as a girl, taken from an abortive collection of songs called ''Quads'';{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=217}} \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\";{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=109}} and an EP, ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'', that tied in with their regular appearances on ''Ready Steady Go!''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=218}} The group continued to have conflict; on 20 May, Moon and Entwistle were late to a gig having been on the ''Ready Steady Go!'' set with [[The Beach Boys]]' [[Bruce Johnston]]. During \"My Generation\", Townshend attacked Moon with his guitar; Moon suffered a black eye and bruises, and he and Entwistle left the band, but changed their minds and rejoined a week later.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=160}} Moon kept looking for other work, and [[Jeff Beck]] had him play drums on his song \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\" (with Page, [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and [[Nicky Hopkins]]) because he was \"trying to get Keith out of the Who\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=175}}\n\n==== ''A Quick One'' and ''The Who Sell Out'' ====\n[[File:Roger Daltrey -left and Keith Moon-right 1967.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roger Daltrey]] (left) and [[Keith Moon]], 1967|alt=Roger Daltrey and Keith Moon backstage in 1967]]\n\nTo alleviate financial pressure on the band, Lambert arranged a song-writing deal which required each member to write two songs for the next album. Entwistle contributed \"[[Boris the Spider]]\" and \"Whiskey Man\" and found a niche role as second songwriter.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=225}} The band found they needed to fill an extra ten minutes, and Lambert encouraged Townshend to write a longer piece, \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\". The suite of song fragments is about a girl who has an affair while her lover is away, but is ultimately forgiven. The album was titled ''[[A Quick One]]''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=227}} (''Happy Jack'' in the US),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-quick-one-happy-jack-mw0000197244|title=A Quick One (Happy Jack)|first=Ritchie|last=Unterberger|website=AllMusic|access-date=24 September 2013|archive-date=5 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905013151/http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-quick-one-happy-jack-mw0000197244|url-status=live}}</ref> and reached No.&nbsp;4 in the UK charts.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=229}} It was followed in 1967 by the UK Top 5 single \"[[Pictures of Lily]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=420}}\n\nBy 1966, ''Ready Steady Go!'' had ended, the mod movement was becoming unfashionable, and the Who found themselves in competition on the London circuit with groups including [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=239\u2013240}} Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group's future, and arranged a deal with promoter [[Frank Barsalona]] for a short package tour in New York.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=243}} The group's performances, which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums, were well received,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=247}} and led to their first major US appearance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. The group, especially Moon, were not fond of the [[hippie]] movement, and thought their violent stage act would stand in sharp contrast to the peaceful atmosphere of the festival. Hendrix was also on the bill, and was also going to smash his guitar on stage. Townshend verbally abused Hendrix and accused him of stealing his act,{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=188}} and the pair argued about who should go on stage first, with the Who winning the argument.{{sfn|McMichael|Lyons|1998|p=223}} The Who brought hired equipment to the festival; Hendrix shipped over his regular touring gear from Britain, including a full [[Marshall stack]]. According to biographer [[Tony Fletcher]], Hendrix sounded \"so much better than the Who it was embarrassing\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}} The Who's appearance at Monterey gave them recognition in the US, and \"Happy Jack\" reached the top 30.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}}\n\nThe group followed Monterey with a US tour supporting [[Herman's Hermits]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}} The Hermits were a straightforward pop band and enjoyed drugs and practical jokes. They bonded with Moon,{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=193}} who was excited to learn that [[cherry bomb]]s were legal to purchase in Alabama. Moon acquired a reputation of destroying hotel rooms while on tour,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=247}} with a particular interest in blowing up toilets. Entwistle said the first cherry bomb they tried \"blew a hole in the suitcase ''and'' the chair\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}} Moon recalled his first attempt to flush one down the toilet: \"[A]ll that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable. I never realised dynamite was so powerful.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}} After a gig in [[Flint, Michigan]] on Moon's 21st birthday on 23 August 1967, the entourage caused $24,000 of damage at the hotel, and Moon knocked out one of his front teeth.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=197}} Daltrey later said that the tour brought the band closer, and as the support act, they could turn up and perform a short show without any major responsibilities.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=266}}\n\n[[File:John Entwistle in 1967 with The Who.jpg|thumb|[[John Entwistle]] backstage in 1967|alt=John Entwistle backstage with a bass guitar]]\nAfter the Hermits tour, the Who recorded their next single, \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", which Townshend had written in 1966 but had avoided recording until he was sure it could be produced well.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=273}} Townshend called it \"the ultimate Who record\",{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} and was disappointed it reached only No.&nbsp;10 in the UK.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} It became their best selling single in the US, reaching No.&nbsp;9.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=420}} The group toured the US again with [[The Animals|Eric Burdon and the Animals]], including an appearance on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', miming to \"I Can See For Miles\" and \"My Generation\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=275}} Moon bribed a stage hand to put explosives in his drum kit, who loaded it with ten times the expected quantity. The resulting detonation threw Moon off his drum riser and his arm was cut by a flying piece of a cymbal. Townshend's hair was singed and his left ear left ringing, and a camera and studio monitor were destroyed.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=275\u2013276}}\n\nThe next album was ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''{{spaced en dash}} a [[concept album]] paying tribute to pirate radio, which had been outlawed in August 1967 by the [[Marine, &c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967]]. It included humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=148\u2013149}} a mini [[rock opera]] called \"Rael\", and \"I Can See For Miles\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} The Who declared themselves a [[pop art]] group and thus viewed advertising as an artform; they recorded a wide variety of radio advertisements, such as for canned milkshakes and the [[American Cancer Society]], in defiance of the rising anti-consumerist ethos of the hippie counterculture.{{sfn|DiPerna|1994|pp=44, 47}} Townshend stated, \"We don't change offstage. We live pop art.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=67}} Later that year, Lambert and Stamp formed a record label, [[Track Records]], with distribution by [[Polydor]]. As well as signing Hendrix, Track became the imprint for all the Who's UK output until the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=250}}\n\nThe group started 1968 by touring Australia and New Zealand with the [[Small Faces]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=196}} The groups had trouble with the local authorities and the ''New Zealand Truth'' called them \"unwashed, foul-smelling, booze-swilling no-hopers\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=293}}{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=180}} After an incident that took place on a flight to [[Sydney]], the band were briefly arrested in [[Melbourne]] and then forced to leave the country; [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Gorton]] sent a telegram to The Who telling them never to return to Australia.{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=142}} The Who would not return to Australia again until 2004. They continued to tour across the US and Canada during the first half of the year.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=190}}\n\n==== ''Tommy'', Woodstock, Isle of Wight and ''Live at Leeds'' ====\nBy 1968 the Who had started to attract attention in the [[underground press]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=191}} Townshend had stopped using drugs and became interested in the teachings of [[Meher Baba]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=294}} In August, he gave an interview to ''Rolling Stone'' editor [[Jann Wenner]] describing in detail the plot of a new album project and its relationship to Baba's teachings. The album went through several names during recording, including ''Deaf Dumb and Blind Boy'' and ''Amazing Journey''; Townshend settled on ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=317}} for the album about the life of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and his attempt to communicate with others.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=314\u2013315}}<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/petetownshend/articles/story/9306658/the_rolling_stone_interview_pete_townshend |title=The Rolling Stone Interview: Pete Townshend |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=28 September 1968 |first=Jann |last=Wenner |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401071039/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/petetownshend/articles/story/9306658/the_rolling_stone_interview_pete_townshend |archive-date=1 April 2009 |url-status=unfit }}</ref> Some songs, such as \"Welcome\" and \"Amazing Journey\", were inspired by Baba's teaching,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=320}} and others came from observations within the band. \"Sally Simpson\" is about a fan who tried to climb on stage at a gig by [[the Doors]] that they attended{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=316}} and \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" was written so that ''New York Times'' journalist [[Nik Cohn]], a pinball enthusiast, would give the album a good review.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=221}} Townshend later said, \"I wanted the story of ''Tommy'' to have several levels&nbsp;... a rock singles level and a bigger concept level\", containing the spiritual message he wanted as well as being entertaining.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} The album was projected for a Christmas 1968 release{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} but recording stalled after Townshend decided to make a [[double album]] to cover the story in sufficient depth.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}}\n\nBy the end of the year, 18 months of touring had led to a well-rehearsed and tight live band, which was evident when they performed \"A Quick One While He's Away\" at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' television special. The Stones considered their own performance lacklustre, and the project was never broadcast.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=228\u2013229}} The Who had not released an album in over a year, and had not completed the recording of ''Tommy'', which continued well into 1969, interspersed with gigs at weekends.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} Lambert was a key figure in keeping the group focused and getting the album completed, and typed up a script to help them understand the story and how the songs fitted together.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Roger-Daltrey in Hamburg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|By the time the Who were touring ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', Daltrey's stage image had changed to include long hair and open shirts.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=344}}|alt=Roger Daltrey singing on stage]]\nThe album was released in May with the accompanying single, \"Pinball Wizard\", a d\u00e9but performance at [[Ronnie Scott's]],{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=222}} and a [[Tommy Tour|tour]], playing most of the new album live.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=326}} ''Tommy'' sold 200,000 copies in the US in its first two weeks,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=223}} and was a critical smash, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' saying, \"for sheer power, invention and brilliance of performance, ''Tommy'' outstrips anything which has ever come out of a recording studio\".<ref name=\"Sanctuary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010522/http://www.sanctuarygroup.com/index.php?page=1&l1=6&l2=10&l3=0&getArticleId=466 The Who].

Daltrey was grateful that the Who had saved him from a career as a sheet-metal worker and was unhappy at Townshend not playing well; Townshend felt the commitment of the group prevented him from releasing solo material.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=458}} The next album, ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'', had introspective songs from Townshend that dealt with disillusionment such as \"However Much I Booze\" and \"How Many Friends\"; they resembled his later solo work.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=460}} Entwistle's \"Success Story\" gave a humorous look at the music industry, and \"[[Squeeze Box (The Who song)|Squeeze Box]]\" was a hit single.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=364}} The group toured from October, playing little new material and few ''Quadrophenia'' numbers, and reintroducing several from ''Tommy''.

By this point, Moon was so unhealthy that the Who conceded it would be difficult for him to cope with touring. The only gig that year was an informal show on 15 December at the [[Gaumont State Cinema]] in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], London, filmed for the documentary ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=406}} The band had not played for 14 months, and their performance was so weak that the footage was unused.

Daltrey clashed with Johns over the production of his vocals, and Moon's drumming was so poor that Daltrey and Entwistle considered firing him. Moon's playing improved, but on one track, \"Music Must Change\", he was replaced as he could not play in 6/8 time.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=496}} In May, the Who filmed another performance at Shepperton Sound Studios for ''The Kids Are Alright''. This performance was strong, and several tracks were used in the film. It was the last gig Moon performed with the Who.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=499}}\n\nThe album was released on 18 August, and became their biggest and fastest seller to date, peaking at No.&nbsp;6 in the UK and No.&nbsp;2 in the US.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=430}} Instead of touring, Daltrey, Townshend and Moon did a series of promotional television interviews, and Entwistle worked on the soundtrack for ''The Kids Are Alright''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=504\u2013505}}\n\nOn 6 September, Moon attended a party held by [[Paul McCartney]] to celebrate [[Buddy Holly]]'s birthday. Returning to his flat, Moon took 32 tablets of [[clomethiazole]] which had been prescribed to combat his [[alcohol withdrawal]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=416}} He passed out the following morning and was discovered dead later that day.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=506\u2013507}}{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=416}}\n\n=== 1978\u20131983 ===\nThe day after Moon's death, Townshend issued the statement: \"We are more determined than ever to carry on, and we want the spirit of the group to which Keith contributed so much to go on, although no human being can ever take his place.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=416\u2013417}} Drummer [[Phil Collins]], having a temporary break from [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] after his first marriage had failed, was at a loose end and asked to replace Moon, but Townshend had already asked [[Kenney Jones]], who had previously played with the Small Faces and [[Faces (band)|Faces]].

such as [[The Kinks]]' [[Mick Avory]] and [[The Shadows]]' [[Brian Bennett]] who did not consider [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]] necessary for rock music.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=109}} Moon used [[Premier]] kits starting in 1966. He avoided the [[hi-hat]], and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and [[cymbal]]s.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=152}}\n\nJones' concise, supportive drumming style was in sharp contrast to Moon's. The Who were initially enthusiastic about working with a completely different drummer.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=539}} Townshend later stated, \"we've never really been able to replace Keith\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=543}} and Daltrey ultimately believed Jones was not right for the band, while still speaking highly of him as a friend and drummer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-who-kenney-jones/|title=The History of Kenney Jones' Time With the Who|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref> Starkey knew Moon from childhood and Moon gave him his first drum kit. Starkey has been praised for his playing style which echoes Moon's without being a copy.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=543}}<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2006/11/zak-starkey/| title=Channeling Keith and More| work=Modern Drummer| date=16 November 2006| access-date=2 November 2010| archive-date=14 April 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414105046/http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2006/11/zak-starkey/| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Songwriting ===\nTownshend focused on writing meaningful lyrics{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=8}} inspired by [[Bob Dylan]], whose words dealt with subjects other than boy\u2013girl relationships that were common in rock music; in contrast to Dylan's intellectualism, Townshend believed his lyrics should be about things kids could relate to.{{sfn|DiPerna|1994|p=46}} Early material focused on the frustration and anxiety shared by mod audiences,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=8}} which Townshend said was a result of \"searching for {{interp|his|original=my}} niche\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=118}} By ''The Who Sell Out'', he began to work narrative and characters into songs,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=282}} which he fully developed by ''Tommy'', including spiritual themes influenced by Baba.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} From the mid-1970s onwards, his songs tended to be more personal,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=460}} which influenced his decision to go solo.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=518\u2013519}}\n\nEntwistle's songs, by contrast, typically feature [[black humour]] and darker themes.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=252}} His two contributions to ''Tommy'' (\"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Fiddle About\") appeared because Townshend did not believe he could write songs as \"nasty\" as Entwistle's.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}}\n\n== Personal relationships ==\n{{quote box|width=18em|align=right|quote=\"We're not mates at all.\"|source=\u2014[[Roger Daltrey]], 1965{{sfn|Ewbank|Hildred|2012|p=28}}}}\n{{quote box|width=18em|align=right|quote=\"I just couldn't get through to Pete and Roger. We have absolutely nothing in common apart from music.\"|source=\u2014[[Keith Moon]], 1965{{sfn|Ewbank|Hildred|2012|p=28}}}}\nThe Who are perceived as having had a poor working relationship. In the original band, Sandom had been the peacemaker and settled disputes. Moon, by contrast, was as volatile as Daltrey and Townshend. Entwistle was too passive to become involved in arguments.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=87}} The group established their live reputation and stage show in part out of insecurity and aggression amongst its members,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=122}} and Townshend recalled that all decisions had to be made democratically \"because we always disagreed\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=140}}\n\nThe only genuine friendship in the Who during the 1960s was between Entwistle and Moon. The pair enjoyed each other's sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing. Journalist Richard Green noted a \"chemistry of playfullness that would go beyond playfullness\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=126}} Their relationship diminished somewhat when Entwistle got married in 1967, though they still socialised on tour.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}} When Moon was destroying toilets in hotels, Entwistle confessed he \"was standing behind him with the matches\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/28/local/me-john28/2|title=John Entwistle, 57; Innovative Bass Player Co-Founded the Who|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=28 June 2002|access-date=6 December 2014|archive-date=22 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222125424/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/28/local/me-john28/2|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe group regularly argued in the press,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=140}} though Townshend said disputes were amplified in print and the group simply found it difficult to agree on things.<ref name=\"waddell\">{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgHgDgiLzqMC&q=%22the+who%22+%22concert+for+new+york+city%22&pg=RA5-PA19|title=Q & A&nbsp;\u2013 Pete Townshend|first=Ray|last=Waddell|magazine=Billboard|date=9 January 2010|access-date=6 December 2014|archive-date=15 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815195109/https://books.google.com/books?id=EgHgDgiLzqMC&q=%22the+who%22+%22concert+for+new+york+city%22&pg=RA5-PA19|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Tommy'' mutually benefitted Townshend and Daltrey's standing in the band because of the former's songwriting and the latter's stage presence, yet even this did not make them close friends.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=144}} The pair quarrelled, particularly in the mid-1970s, over the group's direction.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=426}} During his time with the band, Jones was subject to intermittent criticism from Daltrey.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=517}}\n\nEntwistle's death came as a shock to both Townshend and Daltrey, and caused them to re-evaluate their relationship. Townshend has said that he and Daltrey have since become close friends.<ref name=\"waddell\" /> In 2015, Townshend confirmed their friendship was still strong, adding their acceptance of each other's
