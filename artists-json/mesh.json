A mesh is similar to a [[spider web|web]] or a [[Net (textile)|net]] in that it has many attached or woven strands.\n\n==Types==\n* A [[plastic]] mesh may be extruded, [[oriented]], expanded, [[weaving|woven]]<ref>[http://www.wiremeshes.eu/ Synthetic woven wire mesh] Information on polyester and polypropylene wire cloth</ref> or [[Cylinder (geometry)|tubular]]. It can be made from [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene]], [[nylon]], [[PVC]] or [[PTFE]].\n* A [[metal]] mesh may be [[weaving|woven]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Woven Wire Mesh Overview {{!}} LSM|url=https://www.lawrencesinteredmetals.com/square-weave-wire-mesh/|access-date=2020-10-07|language=en-US}}</ref> [[knitting|knitted]], welded, [[Expanded metal|expanded]], [[sintering|sintered]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sintered wire mesh {{!}} Lianda Filter|url=https://www.liandafilter.com/sintered-wire-mesh-laminates/|access-date=2021-07-15|language=en-US}}</ref> photo-chemically etched or [[Electroforming|electroformed]] ([[screen filter]]) from [[steel]] or other [[metal]]s.\n* In [[clothing]], mesh is loosely [[woven]] or [[knitted]] fabric that has many closely spaced holes.  Knitted mesh is frequently used for modern sports [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]]s and other clothing like [[hosiery]] and [[lingerie]]\n* A mesh [[skin graft]] is a skin patch that has been cut systematically to create a mesh. Meshing of skin grafts provides coverage of a greater surface area at the recipient site, and also allows for the egress of serous or sanguinous fluid. However, it results in a rather pebbled appearance upon healing that may ultimately look less aesthetically pleasing.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1295109-overview emedicine >Skin, Grafts] Author: Benjamin C Wood. Coauthor(s): Christian N Kirman. Updated: Jan 29, 2010</ref>\n*Fiberglass mesh<ref>[[Fiberglass mesh]] Fiberglass mesh</ref> is a neatly woven, crisscross pattern of fiberglass thread that can be used to create new products such as door screens, filtration components, and reinforced adhesive tapes. It is commonly sprayed with a [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC coating]] to make it stronger, last longer, and to prevent [[Fibreglass #Health problems|skin irritation]].\n*Coiled wire fabric is a type of mesh that is constructed by interlocking metal wire coils via a simple corkscrew method. The resulting spirals are then woven together to create a flexible metal fabric panel. Coiled wire fabric mesh is a product that is used by architects to design commercial and residential structures. It is also used in industrial settings to protect personnel and contain debris. Additionally, coiled wire fabric mesh is used for zoo enclosures, typically aviary and small mammal exhibits. <ref>[https://www.constructionspecifier.com/the-art-of-coiled-wire-fabric-flexibility-and-form-on-a-large-scale/ >The Art of Coiled Wire Fabric: Flexibility and form on a large scale] Author: Andrew Schoenheit.

[[Window screen|Wire screens]] on [[window]]s and [[mosquito net]]ting are meshes.\n* Wire screens can be used to shield against [[radio frequency]] radiation, e.g. in [[microwave oven]]s and [[Faraday cage]]s.\n* Metal and nylon wire mesh filters are used in [[Water purification|filtration]].\n* Wire mesh is used in guarding for secure areas and as protection in the form of [[Vandalism|vandal]] screens.\n* Wire mesh can be fabricated to produce park benches, [[waste basket]]s and other baskets for material handling.\n* Woven meshes are basic to [[screen printing]].\n* [[Surgical mesh]] is used to provide a reinforcing structure in surgical procedures like inguinal hernioplasty, and umbilical hernia repair.\n* Meshes are used as drum heads in practice and electronic drum sets.\n* [[Fence]] for [[livestock]] or [[poultry]] ([[chicken wire]] or hardware cloth)\n* Humane animal trapping uses woven or welded wire mesh cages ([[chicken wire]] or hardware cloth) to trap wild animals like raccoons and skunks in populated areas.\n* Meshes can be used for eyes in masks.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Expanded metal]]\n* [[Faraday cage]]\n* [[Gauze]]\n** [[Wire gauze]]\n* [[Heating mantle]]\n* [[Latticework]]\n* [[Mesh (scale)]]\n* [[Polygon mesh]]\n* [[Sieve]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|mesh}}\n{{Wikidata property |1=P486}}\n\n{{Fabric}}\n[[Category:Woven fabrics]]\n[[Category:Net fabrics]]\n[[Category:Filters]]\n[[Category:Building materials]]\n[[Category:Steel]]", "sha1": "pt5g63j5vjne66uglb7ph6hpwt66hl7"}
