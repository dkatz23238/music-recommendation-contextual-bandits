The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist [[M. Shadows]], rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist [[Synyster Gates]], bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]].\n\nAvenged Sevenfold are known for their diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957202/avenged-sevenfold-returns-with-nightmare-after-drummers-death|title = Avenged Sevenfold Returns with 'Nightmare' After Drummer's Death|date = July 26, 2010|access-date = November 8, 2014|magazine = Billboard|last = Harding|first = Cortney}}</ref> The band emerged with a [[metalcore]] sound on their debut album ''[[Sounding the Seventh Trumpet]]'' and continued this sound through their second album ''[[Waking the Fallen]]''. However, the band's style had evolved by the group's third album and first major label release, ''[[City of Evil]]'', into a heavy metal and [[hard rock]] style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its [[Avenged Sevenfold (album)|self-titled]] release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer, [[The Rev|James \"The Rev\" Sullivan]], died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of drummer [[Mike Portnoy]] (ex-[[Dream Theater]]), and released and toured in support of their fifth album ''[[Nightmare (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Nightmare]]'' in 2010, which debuted on atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], their first number one debut.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957051/avenged-sevenfold-scores-first-no-1-album-on-billboard-200|title = Avenged Sevenfold Scores First No. 1 Album on Billboard 200|date = August 4, 2010|access-date = November 8, 2014|magazine = Billboard|last = Caulfield|first = Keith}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011 drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The band's sixth studio album ''[[Hail to the King (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Hail to the King]]'', which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. ''Hail to the King'' charted as number 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. In late 2014, Ilejay left the band, and was replaced by former [[Bad Religion]] drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]], but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album titled ''[[The Stage (album)|The Stage]]'' on October 28, 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart in the US. ''The Stage'' is their first [[Concept album|conceptual album]] and it marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards a [[progressive metal]] sound.\n\nTo date, Avenged Sevenfold have released seven studio albums, one live album/DVD, two [[Compilation album|compilation]] albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/brooks-wackerman-joins-avenged-sevenfold |title=Brooks Wackerman Joins Avenged Sevenfold.  |publisher=Avenged Sevenfold |date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> and their records have received numerous certification awards, including five platinum album awards from their home country's institution ([[RIAA]]). They have also created four original songs for the ''[[Call of Duty (series)|Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' series, all of which were compiled together in the 2018 EP ''[[Black Reign (EP)|Black Reign]]''.
