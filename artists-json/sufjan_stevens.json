Stevens had spent the second half of 2004 researching and writing material for the album. As with ''Michigan'', Stevens used the state of [[Illinois]] as a leaping-off point for his more personal explorations of faith, family, love, and location. Though slated for release on July 5, 2005, the album was briefly delayed by legal issues regarding the use of an image of [[Superman]] in the original album cover artwork.

Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) in the same way that Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking?<ref name=\"Stevens\">{{cite web |last=Stevens |first=Sufjan |title=What's in a Name? |publisher=Asthmatic Kitty Records |url=http://sidebar.asthmatickitty.com/archives/1867 |access-date=May 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525082328/http://sidebar.asthmatickitty.com/archives/1867 |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Solo studio albums (2009\u20132011)===\n[[File:Sufjan Stevens, Leipzig, May 2011.jpg|alt=|190px|thumb|upright|Stevens in 2011, following his return to recording and touring in 2010 after a hiatus]]\nIn September 2009, Stevens began performing four new songs while on his fall tour, \"All Delighted People\", \"Impossible Soul\", \"Too Much\" and \"Age of Adz\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Stosuy |first=Brandon |title=New Sufjan Stevens \u2013 \"There's Too Much Love\"/\"Age Of Adz\"/\"Impossible Souls\" (Live In Ithaca) |website=Stereogum |url=http://stereogum.com/archives/video/new_sufjan_stevens__theres_too_much_love_live_in_092181.html |access-date=October 11, 2009|date=September 25, 2009 }}</ref> That year Stevens contributed to an album with his stepfather, Lowell Brams, entitled ''Music for Insomnia''.
