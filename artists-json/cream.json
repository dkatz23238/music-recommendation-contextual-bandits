In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using [[centrifuge]]s called \"[[Separator (milk)|separator]]s\". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of [[saturated fat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/fat/saturatedfat.html|title=Nutrition for Everyone: Basics: Saturated Fat - DNPAO - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=16 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129222042/http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/fat/saturatedfat.html|archive-date=29 January 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx|title=Eat less saturated fat - Live Well - NHS Choices|first=NHS|last=Choices|website=www.nhs.uk|access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nCream skimmed from milk may be called \"sweet cream\" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from [[whey]], a [[by-product]] of [[cheese]]-making.

Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes.\n\nCream produced by [[cattle]] (particularly [[Jersey cattle]]) grazing on natural [[pasture]] often contains some [[carotenoid]] pigments derived from the [[plant]]s they eat; traces of these intensely colored pigments give milk a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: [[cream (color)|cream]]. Carotenoids are also the origin of [[butter]]'s yellow color. Cream from [[goat]]'s milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1002/0471238961.0315121513011813.a01.pub3|chapter=Colorants for Foods, Drugs, and Cosmetics |title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology |year=2012 |last1=Marmion |first1=Daniel |last2=Updated By Staff |isbn=978-0471238966 }}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n[[File:Merry christmas!.jpg|thumb|250px|Christmas cake covered with whipping cream]]\nCream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including [[ice cream]], many [[sauce]]s, [[soup]]s, stews, puddings, and some [[custard]] bases, and is also used for [[cake]]s. [[Whipped cream]] is served as a topping on ice cream [[sundae]]s, [[milkshake]]s, [[lassi]], [[eggnog]], sweet [[pie]]s, strawberries, blueberries or peaches. Cream is also used in Indian curries such as masala dishes.\n\nCream (usually light/single cream or half and half) may be added to [[coffee]].\n\nBoth single and double cream (see [[Cream#Types|Types]] for definitions) can be used in cooking. Double cream or full-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is often used when the cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent it separating or \"splitting\". Double cream can be thinned with milk to make an approximation of single cream.\n\nThe French word ''cr\u00e8me'' denotes not only dairy cream but also other thick liquids such as sweet and savory [[custard]]s, which are normally made with milk, not cream.<ref>''[[Larousse Gastronomique]], 1938, translated 1961, p. 337</ref>\n\n==Types ==\n\n[[File:Stewed nectarines.JPG|thumb|right|Stewed [[nectarine]]s and heavy cream]]\n\nDifferent grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on.

For example, cream has a tendency to produce oily globules (called \"feathering\") when added to [[coffee]]. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of [[sodium caseinate]], although this is expensive.<ref name=DairyFats/>{{rp|297}}\n\n==Other cream products==\n\n[[File:Milkproducts v2.svg|thumb|275px|Chart of 50 types of milk products and relationships, including cream (click on image to enlarge)]]\n\n{{nowrap|'''[[Butter]]''' is made}} by [[Churning (butter)|churning]] cream to separate the [[butterfat]] and [[buttermilk]]. This can be done by hand or by machine.\n\n'''[[Whipped cream]]''' is made by [[whisk]]ing or [[mixer (cooking)|mixing]] [[air]] into cream with more than 30% fat, to turn the liquid cream into a soft solid. [[Nitrous oxide]], from [[whipped-cream charger]]s may also be used to make whipped cream.\n\n'''[[Sour cream]]''', produced in many countries, is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a [[bacteria]]l culture that produces [[lactic acid]] (0.5%+), which [[souring|sours]] and thickens it.\n\n'''[[Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche]]''' (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as sour cream. Mexican '''[[Crema (dairy product)|crema]]''' (or '''cream espesa''') is similar to cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.\n\n'''[[Smetana (cream)|Smetana]]''' is a heavy cream-derived (15\u201340% milk fat) Central and Eastern European sweet or sour cream.\n\n'''Rjome''' or '''r\u00f8mme''' is Norwegian sour cream containing 35% milk fat, similar to Icelandic '''s\u00fdr\u00f0ur rj\u00f3mi'''.\n\n'''[[Clotted cream]]''' in the United Kingdom is made through a process that starts by slowly heating whole milk to produce a very high-fat (55%) product, similar to Indian '''[[malai]]'''.\n\n'''[[Reduced cream]]''' is a cream product in New Zealand, often used to make [[Kiwi dip]].\n\n==Other items called \"cream\"==\nSome non-edible substances are called creams due to their consistency: shoe cream is runny, unlike regular waxy shoe polish;  hand/body \"creme\" or \"skin cream\" is meant for moisturizing the skin.\n\nRegulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word ''cream'' for foods. Words such as ''creme'', ''kreme'', ''creame'', or ''whipped topping'' (e.g., [[Cool Whip]]) are often used for products which cannot legally be called cream, though in some jurisdictions even these spellings may be disallowed, for example under the doctrine of ''[[idem sonans]]''.<ref>1952 Idaho Op.
