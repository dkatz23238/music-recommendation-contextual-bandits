The album reached number 114 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, and received platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\nThe Postal Service remained largely inactive from 2005 until 2013, when they reunited for a tour and released a re-issue of ''Give Up'' to celebrate its tenth anniversary. Laura Burhenn joined the lineup throughout the tour to provide additional vocals and instruments, with [[Jen Wood]] and [[Jenny Lewis]] filling in for a few shows.<ref name=\"Sonic Awareness\">{{cite web |url = http://sonicawareness.net/post/53027502465/show-recap-the-postal-service-mates-of-states-nyc |title = sonicawareness.net: Show Recap: The Postal Service / Mates of States @ NYC 6/14/2013 |access-date = June 18, 2013 |author = Ambrose, Anthony}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockcandy.omaha.com/2013/08/02/column-my-picks-for-lollapalooza-including/ |title=Column: My picks for Lollapalooza including Postal Service, The Vaccines, more &#124; Rock Candy |publisher=Rockcandy.omaha.com |date=August 2, 2013 |access-date=February 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn August 3, 2013, Gibbard announced that the band would disband permanently after the last show of their reunion tour.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (2001\u20132003)===\nThe group formed after Ben Gibbard contributed vocals for a song by Jimmy Tamborello called \"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan\", from the [[Dntel]] album ''[[Life Is Full of Possibilities]]''. Ben Gibbard became familiar with Tamborello's work after a serendipitous meeting at a [[Flobots]] concert in [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane, WA]]. The song sparked an EP of remixes of other artists, such as [[Lali Puna]], [[The Flaming Lips]], Safety Scissors, [[Barbara Morgenstern]] and [[Superpitcher]], and was so well-received that the two artists decided to further collaborate. The third member of the band, [[Jenny Lewis]], recorded vocals for several tracks before eventually becoming a full-fledged member of the band, sharing vocals and instrumentation in their live shows.\n\nThe band's name was chosen due to the way in which it produced its songs. Due to conflicting schedules, Tamborello wrote and performed instrumental tracks and then sent the [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]s through the [[United States Postal Service]] to Gibbard, who then edited the song as he saw fit (adding his vocals along the way) and sent them back to Tamborello.\n\n===''Give Up'' (2003\u20132007)===\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Give Up]]'', was released on February 18, 2003, on [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]]. Several songs on the album feature guest vocals from Lewis, as well as vocals from indie rock musician [[Jen Wood]]. Additionally, Gibbard's Death Cab for Cutie bandmate [[Chris Walla]] played the [[guitar]] and [[piano]] on several tracks. Although both Gibbard and Tamborello's main projects were still active at the time, The Postal Service supported the album with a successful concert tour, and stated its intention to tour again in the future.\n\n''Give Up'' received [[Music recording certification|gold certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in March 2005, and later receiving [[Music recording certification|platinum certification]] in October 2012. The album was Sub Pop's most successful release after [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s debut album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.subpop.com/scripts/main/news.php?table=news&display_type=news_full&id=400 | title = Postal Service's Give Up Goes Gold, iTunes Exclusive, And More! | access-date = February 18, 2005 | date = February 18, 2005 | publisher = [[Sub Pop]] | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050226200351/http://www.subpop.com/scripts/main/news.php?table=news&display_type=news_full&id=400 | archive-date = February 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe album produced three [[Single (music)|singles]], the most well-known single being \"[[Such Great Heights]]\", which was released as ''Give Up'''s lead single. The song featured in advertisements for [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[Kaiser Permanente]], and [[M&M's]], as well as being the first theme song for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Grey's Anatomy]] in 2005. A cover of the song by [[Iron & Wine]] was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]''. It was also later covered by [[Amanda Palmer]], [[Ben Folds]], [[The Scene Aesthetic]], Brack Cantrell, [[Streetlight Manifesto]], [[Confide (band)|Confide]], Gareth Pearson, Joy Kills Sorrow and [[Postmodern Jukebox]]. Confide would later release a music video for their cover of \"Such Great Heights\". The second single, \"[[The District Sleeps Alone Tonight]]\", was featured in the soundtrack of the 2004 film [[D.E.B.S. (2004 film)|D.E.B.S.]] and later covered by British singer-songwriter [[Frank Turner]]. The third and final single, \"[[We Will Become Silhouettes]]\", was covered by [[The Shins]], and the original version was featured in the trailer for the movie ''[[Funny People]]''.\n\n====United States Postal Service controversy====\nIn August 2003, the [[United States Postal Service]] sent the band a [[cease and desist]] letter, citing the band's name as an infringement of its [[trademark]] on the phrase \"postal service\".  After negotiations, the USPS relented, allowing the band use of the trademark in exchange for promotional efforts on behalf of the USPS and a performance at its annual National Executive Conference.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20041106-4376.html | title = Postal Service delivers, and now rocks | access-date = June 11, 2004 | author = Locklear, Fred | date = June 11, 2004 | publisher = Ars Technica }}</ref> Additionally, at one point the USPS website sold the band's CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://shop.usps.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&storeId=10052&productId=10006172&langId=-1&parent_category_rn=10000001&top_category=10000001&categoryId=10000015&top=&currentPage=0&sort=&viewAll=Y&rn=CategoriesDisplay&WT.ac=10006172 |title = Product: Postal Service \"Such Great Heights\" EP |access-date = September 13, 2009 |publisher = [[United States Postal Service]] }}</ref> In 2007, \"Such Great Heights\" appeared in the background of the \"whiteboard\" advertising campaign for one of the federal establishment's private competitors, the [[United Parcel Service]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Postal Service's music promoting UPS' business |date=January 19, 2007 |work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]}}</ref>\n\n===Possible second album (2007\u20132012)===\nOn June 22, 2007, it was revealed that The Postal Service had begun work on a new album, though the specifics of the production and the release date were vague.  Gibbard stated, \"We're slowly starting. We're crawling right now, and whether that crawl turns into a walk remains to be seen. But we'll know more towards the end of the year. I've just been touring so much and trying to find time to make it happen and make our schedules line up.\" Tamborello added, \"We're talking about wanting to finish an album by sometime next year, because we have to work with Death Cab's schedule and stuff. I definitely want to do another one.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1534893/20060622/postal_service.jhtml | title=Postal Service Prepping Next Delivery: Second LP | access-date=January 12, 2008 | author=Montgomery, James | date = June 22, 2006 | publisher = MTV }}</ref>\n\nOn February 29, 2008, Spinner released an article stating that The Postal Service might not release a new album.

Gibbard said that both he and Tamborello do not see it as a priority in light of their main projects, Death Cab for Cutie and Dntel, respectively. He said, \"The anticipation of the second record has been a far bigger deal for everybody except the two of us... I don't know about it being the indie-rock ''Chinese Democracy'', but now that ''Chinese Democracy'' has come out, I guess it just becomes the second Postal Service record that will never come out. There never really was a plan to do a second album.
