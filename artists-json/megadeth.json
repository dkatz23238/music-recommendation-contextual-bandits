Their music features complex arrangements and fast [[rhythm section]]s, dual lead guitars, and lyrical themes of war, politics, religion, death, and personal relationship.\n\nIn 1985, Megadeth released its debut album, ''[[Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!]]'', on the independent record label [[Combat Records]], to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with [[Capitol Records]]. Their first major-label album, ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]'', was released in 1986 and was a major hit with the underground metal scene. Band members' [[substance abuse]] issues and personal disputes had brought Megadeth negative publicity during the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the band went on to release a number of [[Music recording sales certification|platinum-selling albums]], including ''[[So Far, So Good... So What!]]'' (1988), ''[[Rust in Peace]]'' (1990), and ''[[Countdown to Extinction]]'' (1992). These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition.\n\nMegadeth has had numerous guitarists, drummers and bassists throughout its {{Age|1983|1|1}}-year career, with Mustaine being the only remaining original member of the group. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without longtime bassist [[David Ellefson]], who had taken legal action against him. Ellefson settled out of court and rejoined the band in 2010, but was fired in 2021 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Megadeth's current lineup includes Mustaine, bassist [[James LoMenzo]], guitarist [[Kiko Loureiro]] and drummer [[Dirk Verbeuren]].\n\nMegadeth earned platinum certifications in the United States for six of its fifteen studio albums,<ref name=\"RIAA\"/> and [[List of awards and nominations received by Megadeth|has received twelve Grammy nominations]].
