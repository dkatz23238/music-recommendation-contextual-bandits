At the time, they claimed they discovered that a [[blues]] group named Big Blue Monkey had already existed. Later, on their podcast \"Page Avenue Crew\", they clarified that they just didn't care for the name and made up the excuse of another band having the same name.\n\nIt would not be until three years after forming that Story of the Year saw its first piece of commercial success in its major label debut, ''[[Page Avenue]]'', containing the popular singles \"[[Until the Day I Die]]\" and \"[[Anthem of Our Dying Day]]\". A second album, ''[[In the Wake of Determination]]'', followed in 2005, but did not achieve the commercial success of its predecessor. The band released their third album, ''[[The Black Swan (Story of the Year album)|The Black Swan]]'', on April 22, 2008, which was their first release on [[Epitaph Records]], followed by 2010's ''[[The Constant (Story of the Year album)|The Constant]]''.\n\nOn August 11, 2017, Story of the Year teased a 90-second clip of a new song off their crowd-funded fifth studio album. The pledge campaign began in November 2016 and was completely funded in less than 3 days. The band used high-profile producer [[Aaron Sprinkle]] and mixers [[Tom Lord-Alge|Tom Lord Alge]] & J Hall to complete their fifth studio album. They confirmed via the pledge site that the new album will be titled ''[[Wolves (Story of the Year album)|Wolves]]'', which was released on [[PledgeMusic]] on December 1, 2017. The album's wide release was on December 8, 2017. On February 2, 2019, Story of the Year held their annual hometown show at the Pageant in St. Louis, Missouri to promote ''Wolves''.\n\n==History==\n===67 North & Big Blue Monkey (1995\u20132002)===\nThe band were formed in 1995 under the name \"67 North\" by guitarist Ryan Phillips of the bands Means Well and Locash, drummer Dan Marsala, vocalist John Taylor and bassist Perry West. They changed their name to \"Big Blue Monkey\" in 1998 before releasing the first EP ''Three Days Broken'' that same year. In 1999, they released another EP called ''Truth in Separation'', their last under the line-up. In 2000, West and Taylor would both depart from the group, leading to Marsala moving to vocal duties, and the recruitment of Means Well drummer Josh Wills as well as the members' long time friend Adam Russell on bass duties, despite him never having played bass prior (previously a guitarist prior to joining the band). It was at this point that the band relocated to [[Orange County, California]], where the final Big Blue Monkey EP was released in 2002 titled ''Story of the Year'', which they would then change their name to later that year.<ref name=\"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\" />\n\n===''Page Avenue'' (2002\u20132004)===\n{{Main|Page Avenue}}\n\nAfter spending many years as a local band with different line-ups, recording three EPs and multiple demos, Story of the Year signed a deal with [[Maverick (company)|Maverick Records]] in 2002, then recorded and released their first album, ''[[Page Avenue]]'', in September 2003. The first single from that album was \"Until The Day I Die\". It first received radio airplay around July\u2013August 2003 on stations like [[KPNT]]. The second single, \"Anthem of Our Dying Day\", featured a music video directed by [[Joe Hahn]] of [[Linkin Park]]. Pushed by the success of both singles, ''Page Avenue'' was a success and was certified Gold by the RIAA in 2004,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=Gold & Platinum |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/ |access-date=2022-03-20 |website=RIAA |language=en-US}}</ref> and went on to sell 846,000 copies in the US by 2007.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''[[MTV News]]'' reported on their website that during a radio show in May 2004, the band members of Story of the Year got into a fight with the roadies of [[alternative metal|metal]] band [[Godsmack]].<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488110/20040602/story_of_the_year.jhtml?headlines=true Story of the Year Say Godsmack's Crew Kicked Their Asses.] ''MTV News'', June 2, 2004 Accessed February 6, 2007</ref> Pictures of the band members' bruised faces were posted on their homepage.
