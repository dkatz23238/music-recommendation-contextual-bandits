The line-up has fluctuated over the years, but was long-held constant with band founder, frontman, vocalist, and guitarist [[Wayne Static]] until his death in 2014.\n\nThe band was founded by Wayne Static and original drummer Ken Jay. They rose to fame with their 1999 debut album ''[[Wisconsin Death Trip (album)|Wisconsin Death Trip]]'' where their heavy industrial metal sound attracted attention within the burgeoning [[nu metal]] movement of the late 1990s, with the album eventually going [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the United States.<ref name=\"platinum\">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=&resultpage=78&id=F08994D3-FF52-7C8E-5BDE-262FADF6D771|title=British Rock Royalty Add More Awards|date=July 2, 2001|publisher=[[RIAA]]|access-date=July 22, 2007}}</ref> The band released five more albums over the course of the next decade: ''[[Machine (Static-X album)|Machine]]'' in 2001, ''[[Shadow Zone]]'' in 2003, ''[[Start a War]]'' in 2005, ''[[Cannibal (Static-X album)|Cannibal]]'' in 2007, and ''[[Cult of Static]]'' in 2009.\n\nThe band entered a hiatus while Static worked on his solo album, ''[[Pighammer]]'', in 2011.

In the following year, a promotional [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[The Death Trip Continues]]'', was also released.\n\nThe band toured heavily in support of the album, with Static recounting:\n\n<blockquote>\"It was really just a whirlwind and I barely remember it. We worked so hard and toured so hard that I don't even remember most of it. We played 300 shows in the first year and we just never went home. We would tour on one tour for six or eight weeks and that tour would end somewhere on the East Coast and we'd drive a couple days and hook up with [[Slayer]] and tour with them for four or five weeks. That tour ends and then we'd drive a few days to Boston to hook up with [[Sevendust]]. We just kept going and kept going and never went home. I mean I didn't even have a home. I lived at the rehearsal space for the last year before we started touring. I had to quit my job to make the record so I didn't have anywhere to even go home to...I look back at it now and I kinda wish I had taken the time to sit back and appreciate it more. Maybe got to know some of the other bands a little more and spend time and having a good time and partying and maybe taking some pictures of the other guys.\"<ref name=\"static2014\"/></blockquote>\n\nCommercially, the effort paid off, with the album eventually going platinum in 2001.<ref name=\"platinum\" /> The follow-up tour was documented on the DVD ''Where the Hell Are We and What Day Is It... This Is Static-X''. However, the pressure of recording a follow-up was hard on Static and the rest of the band.
