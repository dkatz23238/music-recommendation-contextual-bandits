Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] describes him as \"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.\"<ref name=\"R&RHOFB\">{{cite web|title=Biography of the Jimi Hendrix Experience|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-jimi-hendrix-experience/bio/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201174555/http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-jimi-hendrix-experience/bio/|archive-date=February 1, 2013|access-date=February 25, 2013|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref><!--quotations should always be supported with an in-line citation, see WP:Leadcite.-->\n\nBorn in [[Seattle]], Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] then [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and began playing gigs on the [[chitlin' circuit]], earning a place in [[the Isley Brothers]]' backing band and later with [[Little Richard]], with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with [[Curtis Knight|Curtis Knight and the Squires]] before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist [[Chas Chandler]] of [[the Animals]] became his manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"[[Hey Joe]]\", \"[[Purple Haze]]\", and \"[[The Wind Cries Mary]]\". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'', reached number one in the US. The [[Double album|double LP]] was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer,<ref name=\"Highest-paid\"/> he headlined the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in 1969 and the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]] in 1970 before [[Death of Jimi Hendrix|his accidental death]] in London from [[barbiturate]]-related [[asphyxia]] on September 18, 1970.\n\nHendrix was inspired by American [[rock and roll]] and [[electric blues]]. He favored [[Distortion (music)|overdriven]] amplifiers with high volume and [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier [[Audio feedback|feedback]]. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering [[effects unit]]s in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, [[Octavia (effects pedal)|Octavia]], [[wah-wah pedal|wah-wah]], and [[Uni-Vibe]]. He was the first musician to use stereophonic [[Phaser (effect)|phasing]] effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented: \"Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.\"{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=428}}\n\nHendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named him the Artist of the Year and ''Rolling Stone'' declared him the Performer of the Year. ''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc and Music Echo]]'' honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, ''[[Guitar Player]]'' named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005. ''Rolling Stone'' ranked the band's three studio albums, ''[[Are You Experienced]]'', ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'', and ''Electric Ladyland'', among the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|100 greatest albums of all time]], and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time.\n\n== Ancestry and childhood ==\n[[File:Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix and Zenora \"Nora\" Rose Hendrix.jpg|thumb|upright|Hendrix's paternal grandparents, Ross and Nora Hendrix, pre-1912|alt=A black and white image (c.1912) of two well-dressed people in their early 20s to late 30s.]]\nHendrix had [[African Americans|African American]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry.
