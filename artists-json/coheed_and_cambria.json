On July 21, 2021, they released the lead single, \"Shoulders\", from their tenth studio album. The album continues the ''Amory Wars'' \"Vaxis\" saga from the previous album, though frontman [[Claudio Sanchez]] noted that parts of the story were still in flux, as some plot points felt insensitive in the wake of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], such as a song titled \"Hallelujah Quarantine\" written before the pandemic, centered around a \"celebration called The Quarantine.
