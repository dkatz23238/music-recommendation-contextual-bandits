These releases would come to be titled ''Unreleased/Unreleasable''. One such mash-up, \"White Noise Christmas\" (for which a video later appeared on their DVD ''[[Volume 3: The Kids Have Eyes]]''), featured on the first [[Bastard Pop|Boomselection]] compilation CD. Some of these were unofficially released on ''Unreleased/Unreleasable [[Volume 1: 65's.late.nite.double-a-side.college.cut-up.trailers.for.the.looped.future.|Volume 1]]'' and ''Volume 2'' in 2003 and 2005 respectively. The band also wrote their own music, releasing their first EP, ''Stumble.Stop.Repeat'', in December 2003 on their own label, Dustpunk Records.\n\n=== ''The Fall of Math'' and ''One Time For All Time'' (2004\u20132005) ===\nRecorded at 2fly studios in Sheffield in four days their first album was released on 20 September 2004. To promote the album, the band released a single, \"[[Retreat! Retreat!]]\", in November 2004, and embarked on two tours, firstly around the time of release and then again in January and February 2005. Their second EP, ''[[Hole (EP)|Hole]]'', was released in March 2005, with the title-track taken from ''[[The Fall of Math]]'' and the band toured again in April and June of that year, with new material played in the latter tour.\n\nDuring summer 2005, the band returned to the studio, intending to write an EP as a follow-up to ''The Fall of Math''. However, the resulting tracks were ultimately released as their second album in October 2005. At the same time the band released a DVD, the third release in the ''Unreleased/Unreleasable'' series, entitled ''[[Volume 3: The Kids Have Eyes]]''. This DVD was their final release on Dustpunk Records. To promote this album, 65 embarked on another UK tour in October, their fourth of the year, with support again from YMSS.\n{{listen\n|pos=right\n | filename     = Radio Protector by 65daysofstatic.ogg\n | title        = \"Radio Protector\" (2005)\n | description  = \"[[Radio Protector]]\" from ''[[One Time for All Time]]''\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nAlthough \"Radio Protector\" was the only track released as a single, a promotional video was also made for \"Drove Through Ghosts To Get Here\". This video was made by Medlo, their long-time collaborators, and Lord Bunn, an artist responsible for many of their T-shirt designs.\n\n\"[[Radio Protector]]\" was the only track from ''One Time for All Time'' issued as a single. Released on [[7\"]] in February 2006, it was limited to 1500 numbered copies, with the first 1000 having a unique [[Instant film|polaroid]] picture as the artwork. The remaining 500 have a digital copy of the thousandth picture as their artwork. An error in the numbering meant that each record is denoted as being [[Variable (mathematics)|x]] of 3000 instead of 1500. The band auctioned off the copy numbered 1/3000 on [[eBay]], with the proceeds going to [[Friends of the Earth]]. A further UK tour, entitled the \"Radio Protector Tour\", coincided with this release. This tour was sandwiched between further dates by the band where they supported [[Hundred Reasons]].\n\n=== ''The Destruction of Small Ideas'' (2005\u20132007) ===\nIn 2005, 65daysofstatic remixed [[Alkaline Trio]]'s single \"Burn\" from the album ''Crimson''. The track appears on one 7\" vinyl out of a set of two. In the same year, the band also remixed \"...Spooks the Horse\", a track by [[Youthmovie Soundtrack Strategies]], for inclusion on the reissue of their first album, ''[[Hurrah! Another Year, Surely This One Will Be Better Than the Last; The Inexorable March of Progress Will Lead Us All to Happiness]]''.[[File:65daysofstatic live in Cork, Ireland on 4 November 2007..jpg|thumb|right| 65daysofstatic live in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 2007.]]\nAfter touring for most of 2006, 65 returned to the studio in December to record their third LP. Recording was completed shortly before Christmas, with mixing taking place in January 2007.\n\n''[[The Destruction of Small Ideas]]'', was released on 30 April 2007.
