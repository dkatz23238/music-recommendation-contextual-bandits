He was among the most influential figures in [[jazz]]. His career spanned five decades and several eras in the history of jazz.<ref name=\"RCJE\">{{Cite book|last=Cook|first=Richard|year=2005|title=Richard Cook's Jazz Encyclopedia|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-100646-8|pages= 18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nArmstrong was born and raised in [[New Orleans]]. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive [[trumpet]] and [[cornet]] player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance.<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 1.</ref> Around 1922, he followed his mentor, [[King Oliver|Joe \"King\" Oliver]], to [[Chicago]] to play in the {{ILL|Creole Jazz Band|fr}}. In Chicago, he spent time with other popular jazz musicians, reconnecting with his friend [[Bix Beiderbecke]] and spending time with [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and [[Lil Hardin Armstrong|Lil Hardin]]. He earned a reputation at \"[[cutting contest]]s\", and his fame reached band leader [[Fletcher Henderson]]. Henderson persuaded Armstrong to come to [[New York City]], where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist. Hardin became Armstrong's second wife and they returned to Chicago to play together and then he began to form his own \"Hot\" jazz bands. After years of touring, he settled in [[Queens]], and by the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, assisted in part, by his appearances on radio and in film and television, in addition to his concerts.\n\nWith his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song. He was also skilled at [[scat singing]]. Armstrong is renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice as well as his trumpet playing. By the end of Armstrong's life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular [[African-American]] entertainers to \"cross over\" to wide popularity with white (and international) audiences. He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for [[desegregation]] in the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock crisis]]. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this was difficult for black men.\n\nArmstrong appeared in films such as ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956) alongside [[Bing Crosby]], [[Grace Kelly]], and [[Frank Sinatra]], and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1969) starring [[Barbra Streisand]]. He received many accolades including three [[Grammy Award]] nominations and a win for his vocal performance of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/louis-armstrong|title= Louis Armstrong \u2013 Artist|website= Grammy.com|date= November 19, 2019|access-date= May 27, 2020}}</ref> In 2017, he was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Adi Holzer Werksverzeichnis 899 Satchmo (Louis Armstrong).jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Louis Armstrong'' (2002), hand-colored [[:en:Etching|etching]] by [[:de:Adi Holzer|Adi Holzer]]]]\nArmstrong was born in [[New Orleans]] on August 4, 1901.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/satchmogeniusofl00gidd/page/21 21]|author=Gary Giddins|title=Satchmo: The Genius of Louis Armstrong|url=https://archive.org/details/satchmogeniusofl00gidd|url-access=registration|publisher=Da Capo|year=2001|isbn=9780306810138}}</ref><ref>Teachout (2009), pp. 26{{endash}}27.</ref><ref>Bergreen (1996), pp. 14\u201315.</ref>{{efn|name=birthdate|Armstrong often stated that he was born on July 4, 1900.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teachout|first=Terry|year=2009|title=Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong| publisher=Houghton Mifflin|page=25|isbn=978-0-15-101089-9}}</ref> Although he died in 1971, it was not until the mid-1980s that his true birth date was discovered by [[Tad Jones]] by researching baptismal records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/about/faq.htm|title=When Is Louis Armstrong's Birthday? |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130116083432/http://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/about/faq.htm#LA5 |archive-date =January 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}} The Official Site of the Louis Armstrong House & Archives.</ref>}} His parents were Mary Albert and William Armstrong.

Peter Davis, who frequently appeared at the home at the request of Captain Jones,<ref>''Current Biography 1944''. p. 16.</ref> became Armstrong's first teacher and chose him as bandleader. With this band, the thirteen-year-old Armstrong attracted the attention of [[Kid Ory]].<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 78.</ref>\n\nOn June 14, 1914, Armstrong was released into the custody of his father and his new stepmother, Gertrude. He lived in this household with two stepbrothers for several months. After Gertrude gave birth to a daughter, Armstrong's father never welcomed him, so he returned to his mother, Mary Albert.

S. Sidney.jpg|thumb|Armstrong was a member of Fate Marable's New Orleans Band in 1918, here on board the S.S. ''Sidney'']]\n\nEarly in his career, Armstrong played in brass bands and [[riverboat]]s in New Orleans, first on an excursion boat in September 1918. He traveled with the band of [[Fate Marable]], which toured on the steamboat ''Sidney'' with the [[Streckfus Steamers]] line up and down the Mississippi River.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jazz on the River|author=William Howland Kenney |location=Chicago|year=2005 |publisher= University of Chicago Press|page=64}}</ref> Marable was proud of his musical knowledge, and he insisted that Armstrong and other musicians in his band learn [[sight reading]]. Armstrong described his time with Marable as \"going to the University\", since it gave him a wider experience working with written [[arrangement]]s. In 1919, Armstrong's mentor, King Oliver decided to go north and resigned his position in Kid Ory's band; Armstrong replaced him. He also became second trumpet for the [[Tuxedo Brass Band]].<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 142.</ref>\n\nThroughout his riverboat experience, Armstrong's musicianship began to mature and expand. At twenty, he could read music. He became one of the first jazz musicians to be featured on extended trumpet solos, injecting his own personality and style. He also started singing in his performances.<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 170.</ref>\n\n===Chicago and recording for Gennett===\nIn 1922, Armstrong moved to Chicago at the invitation of King Oliver,<ref name=\"Collier\" /> although Armstrong would return to New Orleans periodically for the rest of his life.<ref>Kenney (2005), pp. 57\u201359.</ref> Playing second cornet to Oliver in Oliver's Creole Jazz Band in the black-only Lincoln Gardens in Chicago's black neighborhood, he could make enough money to quit his day jobs. Although race relations were poor, Chicago was booming. The city had jobs for blacks making good wages at factories with some left over for entertainment.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|86}}\n\nOliver's band was among the most influential jazz bands in Chicago in the early 1920s. Armstrong lived luxuriously in his own apartment with his first private bath. Excited as he was to be in Chicago, he began his career-long pastime of writing letters to friends in New Orleans. Armstrong could blow two hundred [[C (musical note)#Other octaves|high Cs]] in a row. As his reputation grew, he was challenged to [[cutting contest]]s by other musicians.<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 199.</ref>\n\nHis first studio recordings were with Oliver for [[Gennett Records]] on April 5{{endash}}6, 1923. They endured several hours on the train to remote [[Richmond, Indiana]], and the band was paid little. The quality of the performances was affected by lack of rehearsal, crude recording equipment, bad acoustics, and a cramped studio. These early recordings were true [[Gramophone record#78 rpm disc developments|acoustic]], the band playing directly into a large funnel connected directly to the needle making the groove in the master recording. (Electrical recording was not invented until 1926 and Gennett installed it later.) Because Armstrong's playing was so loud, when he played next to Oliver, Oliver couldn't be heard on the recording. Armstrong had to stand fifteen feet away from Oliver, in a far corner of the room.<ref>Bergreen (1997), pp. 213{{endash}}218.</ref>\n\n[[Lil Hardin Armstrong|Lil Hardin]], who Armstrong would marry in 1924, urged Armstrong to seek more prominent billing and develop his style apart from the influence of Oliver. At her suggestion, Armstrong began to play classical music in church concerts to broaden his skills; and he began to dress more in more stylish attire to offset his girth. Her influence eventually undermined Armstrong's relationship with his mentor, especially concerning his salary and additional money that Oliver held back from Armstrong and other band members.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Stamatel |first=Janet P.|date=2003|editor-last=Henderson|editor-first=Ashyia N|title=Hardin Armstrong, Lil 1898\u20131971 |url= http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX2874100037/GVRL?u=aubu98092&sid=GVRL&xid=18dcff82|journal=Contemporary Black Biography |volume=39 |page=98|via=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}</ref> Armstrong's mother, May Ann Albert, came to visit him in Chicago during the summer of 1923 after being told that Armstrong was \"out of work, out of money, hungry, and sick\"; Hardin located and decorated an apartment for her to live in while she stayed.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brothers|first=Thomas|title=Louis Armstrong: Master of Modernism|publisher=W.W.

Shortly afterward, Armstrong received an invitation to go to New York City to play with the [[Fletcher Henderson]] Orchestra, the top African-American band of the time. He switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section. His influence on Henderson's tenor sax soloist, [[Coleman Hawkins]], can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Lyttelton, Humphrey |title=The Best of Jazz |publisher=Taplinger |year=1979 |isbn=0-8008-0727-8 |pages=113 |oclc=8050573}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Magee |first=Jeffrey |title=The Uncrowned King of Swing |date=2005-02-10 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-509022-2 |pages=112\u2013114|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195090222.001.0001 }}</ref>\n\nArmstrong adapted to the tightly controlled style of Henderson, playing trumpet and experimenting with the trombone. The other members were affected by Armstrong's emotional style. His act included singing and telling tales of New Orleans characters, especially preachers.<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 247.</ref> The Henderson Orchestra played in prominent venues for white patrons only, including the [[Roseland Ballroom]], with arrangements by [[Don Redman]]. Duke Ellington's orchestra went to Roseland to catch Armstrong's performances.\n\nDuring this time, Armstrong recorded with [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]] (a friend from New Orleans), the Williams Blue Five, [[Sidney Bechet]], and blues singers [[Alberta Hunter]], [[Ma Rainey]], and [[Bessie Smith]].<ref>Elliot Hurwitt et al., in Cary D.

For a time he was a member of the Lil Hardin Armstrong Band and working for his wife.<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 260.</ref> He formed [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five]] and recorded the hits \"[[Potato Head Blues]]\" and \"[[Muggles (recording)|Muggles]]\".

Young trumpet players across the country bought these recordings and memorized his solos.\n\nArmstrong was now free to develop his personal style as he wished, which included a heavy dose of effervescent jive, such as \"Whip That Thing, Miss Lil\" and \"Mr. Johnny Dodds, Aw, Do That Clarinet, Boy!\"<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 264.</ref>\n\nArmstrong also played with [[Erskine Tate]]'s Little Symphony, which played mostly at the Vendome Theatre. They furnished music for silent movies and live shows, including jazz versions of classical music, such as \"Madame Butterfly\", which gave Armstrong experience with longer forms of music and with hosting before a large audience. He began to scat sing (improvise vocal jazz using nonsensical words) and was among the first to record it, on the Hot Five recording \"[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]\" in 1926. The recording was so popular that the group became the most famous jazz band in the United States, even though they had not performed live to any great extent. Young musicians across the country, black or white, were turned on by Armstrong's new type of jazz.<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 267.</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Lil, Armstrong started to play at the [[Sunset Cafe|Sunset Caf\u00e9]] for [[Al Capone]]'s associate [[Joe Glaser]] in the [[Carroll Dickerson]] Orchestra, with [[Earl Hines]] on piano, which was renamed Louis Armstrong and his Stompers,<ref>{{cite book|last=Collier|first=James Lincoln |author-link=James Lincoln Collier| title=Louis Armstrong | publisher=Pan Books | year=1985|isbn=978-0-330-28607-7|pages=160\u2013162}}</ref> though Hines was the music director and Glaser managed the orchestra. Hines and Armstrong became fast friends and successful collaborators. It was at the [[Sunset Cafe|Sunset Caf\u00e9]] that Armstrong accompanied singer [[Adelaide Hall]]. It was during Hall's tenure at the venue that she experimented, developed and expanded her use and art of scat singing with Armstrong's guidance and encouragement.<ref>World Catalogue:[https://www.worldcat.org/title/underneath-a-harlem-moon-the-harlem-to-paris-years-of-adelaide-hall/oclc/51780394 Underneath A Harlem Moon] by Iain Cameron Williams {{ISBN|0-8264-5893-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the first half of 1927, Armstrong assembled his Hot Seven group, which added drummer Al \"Baby\" Dodds and tuba player, Pete Briggs, while preserving most of his original Hot Five lineup. John Thomas replaced Kid Ory on trombone. Later that year he organized a series of new Hot Five sessions which resulted in nine more records. In the last half of 1928, he started recording with a new group: Zutty Singleton (drums), Earl Hines (piano), Jimmy Strong (clarinet), Fred Robinson (trombone), and Mancy Carr (banjo).<ref>Harker (2011), p. 145.</ref>\n\n===The Harlem Renaissance===\nArmstrong made a huge impact during the 1920s [[Harlem Renaissance]] within the Jazz world.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2007/08/01/12208712/louis-armstrong-the-man-and-his-music-part-1 |title=Louis Armstrong: 'The Man and His Music,' Part 1 |date=August 1, 2007 |website=[[National Public Radio]] |access-date=May 21, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803154258/https://www.npr.org/2007/08/01/12208712/louis-armstrong-the-man-and-his-music-part-1 |archive-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref> His music touched many, including a well-known writer during that time named [[Langston Hughes]].

Armstrong also had considerable success with vocal recordings, including versions of songs composed by his old friend [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. His 1930s recordings took full advantage of the new RCA [[ribbon microphone]], introduced in 1931, which imparted a characteristic warmth to vocals and immediately became an intrinsic part of the '[[crooning]]' sound of artists like [[Bing Crosby]]. Armstrong's interpretation of Carmichael's \"[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\" became one of the most successful versions of this song ever recorded, showcasing Armstrong's unique vocal sound and style and his innovative approach to singing songs that had already become standards.\n\nArmstrong's radical re-working of [[Sidney Arodin]] and Carmichael's \"[[Lazy River]]\" (recorded in 1931) encapsulated many features of his groundbreaking approach to melody and phrasing. The song begins with a brief trumpet solo, then the main melody is introduced by sobbing horns, memorably punctuated by Armstrong's growling interjections at the end of each bar: \"Yeah! ...\"Uh-huh\"...\"Sure\"...\"Way down, way down.\" In the first verse, he ignores the notated melody entirely and sings as if playing a trumpet solo, pitching most of the first line on a single note and using strongly syncopated phrasing. In the second stanza he breaks into an almost fully improvised melody, which then evolves into a classic passage of Armstrong \"[[scat singing]]\".\n\nAs with his trumpet playing, Armstrong's vocal innovations served as a foundation stone for the art of jazz vocal interpretation. The uniquely gravelly coloration of his voice became a musical archetype that was much imitated and endlessly impersonated. His scat singing style was enriched by his matchless experience as a trumpet soloist. His resonant, velvety lower-register tone and bubbling cadences on sides such as \"Lazy River\" exerted a huge influence on younger white singers such as Bing Crosby.\n\n===Working during hard times===\n[[File:Maud_Cuney_Hare-154-Louis_Armstrong.jpg|left|thumb|Photo of Armstrong in 1936]]\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s was especially hard on the jazz scene. The Cotton Club closed in 1936 after a long downward spiral, and many musicians stopped playing altogether as club dates evaporated. Bix Beiderbecke died and Fletcher Henderson's band broke up. King Oliver made a few records but otherwise struggled. [[Sidney Bechet]] became a tailor, later moving to Paris and Kid Ory returned to New Orleans and raised chickens.<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 320.</ref>\n\nArmstrong moved to Los Angeles in 1930 to seek new opportunities. He played at the New Cotton Club in Los Angeles with [[Lionel Hampton]] on drums. The band drew the Hollywood crowd, which could still afford a lavish night life, while radio broadcasts from the club connected with younger audiences at home. Bing Crosby and many other celebrities were regulars at the club. In 1931, Armstrong appeared in his first movie, ''Ex-Flame'' and was also convicted of marijuana possession but received a suspended sentence.<ref>Collier (1985), pp. 221\u2013222</ref> He returned to Chicago in late 1931 and played in bands more in the [[Guy Lombardo]] vein and he recorded more standards. When the mob insisted that he get out of town,<ref name=\"ArmstrongInThe30s\">{{cite web |title=Louis Armstrong in the 30s|url=http://riverwalkjazz.stanford.edu/program/louis-armstrong-30s-tribute-life-and-music-armstrong-30s |website=riverwalkjazz.stanford.edu |access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref> Armstrong visited New Orleans, had a hero's welcome, and saw old friends. He sponsored a local baseball team known as Armstrong's Secret Nine and had a cigar named after him.<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 344.</ref> But soon he was on the road again. After a tour across the country shadowed by the mob, he fled to Europe.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, he undertook several exhausting tours. His agent Johnny Collins's erratic behavior and his own spending ways left Armstrong short of cash. Breach of contract violations plagued him. He hired Joe Glaser as his new manager, a tough mob-connected wheeler-dealer, who began to straighten out his legal mess, his mob troubles, and his debts. Armstrong also began to experience problems with his fingers and lips, which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style. As a result, he branched out, developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances. He appeared in movies again, including Crosby's 1936 hit ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]''. In 1937, Armstrong substituted for [[Rudy Vallee]] on the CBS radio network and became the first African American to host a sponsored, national broadcast.<ref>Bergreen (1997), p. 385.</ref>\n\n===Reviving his career with the All Stars===\n[[File:Louis Armstrong2.jpg|thumb|upright|Armstrong in 1953]]\nAfter spending many years on the road, Armstrong settled permanently in Queens, New York in 1943 in contentment with his fourth wife, Lucille. Although subject to the vicissitudes of [[Tin Pan Alley]] and the gangster-ridden music business, as well as anti-black prejudice, he continued to develop his playing.\n\nBookings for big bands tapered off during the 1940s due to changes in public tastes: ballrooms closed, and there was competition from other types of music, especially pop vocals, becoming more popular than big band music. It became impossible under such circumstances to finance a 16-piece touring band.\n\nA widespread revival of interest in the 1940s in the traditional jazz of the 1920s made it possible for Armstrong to consider a return to the small-group musical style of his youth. Armstrong was featured as a guest artist with Lionel Hampton's band at the famed second Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]] in Los Angeles which was produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.|Leon Hefflin Sr.]] on October 12, 1946.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Black music history of Los Angeles, its roots : 50 years in Black music : a classical pictorial history of Los Angeles Black music of the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s: photographic essays that define the people, the artistry and their contributions to the wonderful world of entertainment|last=Reed, Tom.|date=1992|publisher=Black Accent on L.A.

During the concert, Armstrong and Teagarden performed a duet on Hoagy Carmichael's \"[[Rockin' Chair (1929 song)|Rockin' Chair]]\" they then recorded for [[Okeh Records]].\n\nArmstrong's manager, Joe Glaser dissolved the Armstrong big band on August 13, 1947, and established a six-piece traditional jazz group featuring Armstrong with (initially) Teagarden, [[Earl Hines]] and other top swing and Dixieland musicians, most of whom were previously leaders of big bands. The new group was announced at the opening of [[Billy Berg's]] Supper Club.\n\nThis group was called Louis Armstrong and His All Stars and included at various times [[Earl Hines|Earl \"Fatha\" Hines]], [[Barney Bigard]], [[Edmond Hall]], Jack Teagarden, [[Trummy Young]], [[Arvell Shaw]], [[Billy Kyle]], [[Marty Napoleon]], [[Sid Catlett|Big Sid \"Buddy\" Catlett]], [[Cozy Cole]], [[Tyree Glenn]], [[Barrett Deems]], [[Mort Herbert]], [[Joe Darensbourg]], [[Eddie Shu]], [[Joe Muranyi]] and percussionist [[Danny Barcelona]].\n\nOn February 28, 1948, [[Suzy Delair]] sang the French song ''[[C'est si bon]]'' at the [[Hotel Negresco]] during the first [[Nice Jazz Festival]]. Louis Armstrong was present and loved the song. On June 26, 1950, he recorded the American version of the song (English lyrics by [[Jerry Seelen]]) in [[New York City]] with [[Sy Oliver]] and his Orchestra. When it was released, the disc was a worldwide success and the song was then performed by the greatest international singers.\n\nHe was the first jazz musician to appear on the cover of ''Time'' magazine, on February 21, 1949. Louis Armstrong and his All Stars were featured at the ninth Cavalcade of Jazz concert also at [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]] in Los Angeles produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.|Leon Hefflin Sr.]] held on June 7, 1953, along with [[Shorty Rogers]], [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]], Don Tosti and His Mexican Jazzmen, [[Earl Bostic]], and [[Nat King Cole|Nat \"King\" Cole]].<ref>\"Satchmo Band Spice To Open Air Show\". ''Los Angeles Sentinel'' May 28, 1953.\n</ref>\n\nDuring the next 30 years, Armstrong played more than 300 performances a year. During this period, Armstrong made many recordings and appeared in over thirty films.\n\n===A jazz ambassador===\n[[File:Louis Armstrong (1955).jpg|thumb|left|Armstrong in 1955]]\n\nBy the 1950s, Armstrong was a widely beloved American icon and cultural ambassador who commanded an international fanbase. However, a growing generation gap became apparent between him and the young jazz musicians who emerged in the postwar era such as [[Charlie Parker]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Sonny Rollins]]. The postwar generation regarded their music as abstract art and considered Armstrong's vaudevillian style, half-musician and half-stage entertainer, outmoded and [[Uncle Tom syndrome|Uncle Tomism]], \"... he seemed a link to [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]] that we were ashamed of.\"<ref name=\"Starkey2015\">{{cite book |last=Starkey|first=Brando Simeo|title=In Defense of Uncle Tom: Why Blacks Must Police Racial Loyalty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA147|access-date=13 June 2018|year=2015 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-316-21408-4|pages=147\u2013}}</ref> He called bebop \"Chinese music\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Music: the definitive visual history|publisher=DK|editor=Ziegler, Robert |year=2013|isbn=9781465414366 |location=London|pages=247|oclc=828055596}}</ref> While touring Australia in 1954, he was asked if he could play bebop. \"Bebop?\" he husked. \"I just play music.

He also toured Africa, Europe, and Asia under the [[Jazz ambassadors|sponsorship of the US State Department]] with great success, earning the nickname \"Ambassador Satch\" and inspiring Dave Brubeck to compose his jazz musical ''[[The Real Ambassadors]]''. By 1968, he was approaching 70 and his health began to give out. He suffered heart and kidney ailments that forced him to stop touring. He did not perform publicly at all in 1969 and spent most of the year recuperating at home. Meanwhile, his longtime manager [[Joe Glaser]] died. By the summer of 1970, his doctors pronounced him fit enough to resume live performances.

The same applies to his 1952 studio recording of the song \"Chloe\", where the choir in the background sings \"Louie ... Louie\", with Armstrong responding \"What was that?

His autobiography vexed some biographers and historians, as he had a habit of telling tales, particularly of his early childhood when he was less scrutinized, and his embellishments of his history often lack consistency.<ref name=\"bergreen7\">Bergreen (1997), pp. 7\u201311.</ref>\n\nIn addition to being an entertainer, Armstrong was a leading personality of the day. He was beloved by an American public that gave even the greatest [[African American]] performers little access beyond their public celebrity, and he was able to live a private life of access and privilege afforded to few other African Americans during that era.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/>\n\nHe generally remained politically neutral, which at times alienated him from members of the black community who looked to him to use his prominence with white America to become more of an outspoken figure during the [[civil rights movement]]. However, he did criticize [[President Eisenhower]] for not acting forcefully enough on civil rights.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/>\n\n===Health problems===\nThe trumpet is a notoriously hard instrument on the [[lips]], and Armstrong suffered from lip damage over much of his life due to his aggressive style of playing and preference for narrow mouthpieces that would stay in place more easily, but which tended to dig into the soft flesh of his inner lip. During his 1930s European tour, he suffered an ulceration so severe that he had to stop playing entirely for a year. Eventually he took to using salves and creams on his lips and also cutting off scar tissue with a razor blade. By the 1950s, he was an official spokesman for Ansatz-Creme Lip Salve.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/nyregion/louis-armstrongs-lip-balm.html|title=Louis Armstrong's Lip Balm|first=Bill|last=Schulz|date=August 26, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nDuring a backstage meeting with trombonist Marshall Brown in 1959, Armstrong received the suggestion that he should go to a doctor and receive proper treatment for his lips instead of relying on home remedies, but he did not get around to arranging it until the final years of his life, by which point his health was failing and doctors considered surgery too risky.<ref>\"Louis Armstrong: An American Genius\", [[James Lincoln Collier|James L. Collier]], 231 pp.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1959, Armstrong was hospitalized for [[pneumonia]] while on tour in [[Italy]]. Doctors were concerned about his lungs and heart, but by June 26 he rallied.<ref>\"Satchmo Rallies, Jokes\" [[The Ottawa Citizen]], June 26, 1959, p. 1</ref>\n\n===Nicknames===\n[[File:Armstrong-Alassio (crop).jpg|thumb|right|Autograph of Armstrong on the muretto of [[Alassio]]]]\n\nThe nicknames \"Satchmo\" and \"Satch\" are short for \"Satchelmouth\". The nickname has many possible origins.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/> The most common tale that biographers tell is the story of Armstrong as a young boy in New Orleans dancing for pennies. He scooped the coins off the street and stuck them into his mouth to prevent bigger children from stealing them. Someone dubbed him \"satchel mouth\" for his mouth acting as a satchel. Another tale is that because of his large mouth, he was nicknamed \"satchel mouth\" which was shortened to \"Satchmo\".<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/>\n\nEarly on he was also known as \"Dipper\", short for \"Dippermouth\", a reference to the piece ''Dippermouth Blues''<ref>Armstrong, 1954, pp. 27\u201328</ref> and something of a riff on his unusual [[embouchure]].\n\nThe nickname \"Pops\" came from Armstrong's own tendency to forget people's names and simply call them \"Pops\" instead. The nickname was turned on Armstrong himself. It was used as the title of a 2010 biography of Armstrong by Terry Teachout.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/>\n\nAfter a competition at the Savoy, he was crowned and nicknamed \"King Menelik\", after the Emperor of Ethiopia, for slaying \"[[ofay]] jazz demons\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brothers|first=Thomas|title=Louis Armstrong: Master of Modernism|publisher=W.W.

Eisenhower|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]], calling him \"two-faced\" and \"gutless\" because of his inaction during the [[Little Rock Nine|conflict]] over school [[desegregation]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], in 1957. As a protest, Armstrong canceled a planned tour of the [[Soviet Union]] on behalf of the [[State Department]] saying: \"The way they're treating my people in the South, the government can go to hell\" and that he could not represent his government abroad when it was in conflict with its own people.<ref name=\"Louis Armstrong, Barring Soviet Tour, Denounces Eisenhower and Gov.

On the road, he wrote constantly, sharing favorite themes of his life with correspondents around the world.

Although he is usually listed as being a member of Montgomery Lodge No. 18 (Prince Hall) in New York, no such lodge has ever existed. However, Armstrong stated in his autobiography that he was a member of the [[Knights of Pythias]], which although real is not a Masonic group.<ref>{{Cite news\n| title = Non-masons \u2013 Louis Armstrong\n| work = Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon\n| url = http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/armstrong_l/armstrong_l.html\n| access-date = September 3, 2010}}</ref>\nDuring the krewe's 1949 [[Mardi Gras in New Orleans|Mardi Gras]] parade, Armstrong presided as King of the [[Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club]], for which he was featured on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Louis the First | newspaper = Time | date = 1949-02-21 | url = http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,805063-1,00.html | access-date = 2021-02-05}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n\n===Horn playing and early jazz===\n[[File:Selmer Trumpet given by King George V to Louis Armstrong.jpg|thumb|right|Selmer trumpet, given as a gift by [[King George V]] of the United Kingdom to Louis Armstrong in 1933]]\nIn his early years, Armstrong was best known for his virtuosity with the cornet and trumpet. Along with his \"clarinet-like figurations and high notes in his cornet solos\", he was also known for his \"intense rhythmic 'swing', a complex conception involving ... accented upbeats, upbeat to downbeat slurring, and complementary relations among rhythmic patterns.\"<ref>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |last=Harker |first=Brian Cameron |date=1997 |title=The early musical development of Louis Armstrong, 1901\u20131928 |publisher=Columbia University |id={{ProQuest|304443911}} }}</ref> The most lauded recordings on which Armstrong plays trumpet include the [[Louis Armstrong Hot Five and Hot Seven Sessions|Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions]], as well as those of the [[Red Onion Jazz Babies]]. Armstrong's improvisations, while unconventionally sophisticated for that era, were also subtle and highly melodic. The solo that Armstrong plays during the song \"[[Potato Head Blues]]\" has long been considered his best solo of that series.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/><ref>Lynn Rene Bayley, \"More Jazz: 'Louis Armstrong{{snd}}The Early Years\". ''Fanfare{{snd}}The Magazine for Serious Record Collectors''. 09 2008: 408\u2013410. ProQuest. Web. 14 July 2016.</ref>\n\nPrior to Armstrong, most collective ensemble playing in jazz, along with its occasional solos, simply varied the melodies of the songs. Armstrong was virtually the first to create significant variations based on the chord harmonies of the songs instead of merely on the melodies. This opened a rich field for creation and improvisation, and significantly changed the music into a soloist's art form.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/>\n\nOften, Armstrong re-composed pop-tunes he played, simply with variations that made them more compelling to jazz listeners of the era. At the same time, however, his oeuvre includes many original melodies, creative leaps, and relaxed or driving rhythms. Armstrong's playing technique, honed by constant practice, extended the range, tone and capabilities of the trumpet. In his records, Armstrong almost single-handedly created the role of the jazz soloist, taking what had been essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form with tremendous possibilities for individual expression.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/>\n\nArmstrong was one of the first artists to use recordings of his performances to improve himself. Armstrong was an avid audiophile. He had a large collection of recordings, including reel-to-reel tapes, which he took on the road with him in a trunk during his later career. He enjoyed listening to his own recordings, and comparing his performances musically. In the den of his home, he had the latest audio equipment and would sometimes rehearse and record along with his older recordings or the radio.<ref>Michael Cogswell, ''Louis Armstrong: The Offstage Story of Satchmo'' (Collector's Press, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, 2003) {{ISBN|1-888054-81-6}} pp. 66\u201368.</ref>\n\n===Vocal popularity===\nAs his music progressed and popularity grew, his singing also became very important. Armstrong was not the first to record scat singing, but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it with the first recording on which he scatted, \"[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]\". At a recording session for [[Okeh Records]], when the sheet music supposedly fell on the floor and the music began before he could pick up the pages, Armstrong simply started singing nonsense syllables while Okeh president E.A. Fearn, who was at the session, kept telling him to continue. Armstrong did, thinking the track would be discarded, but that was the version that was pressed to disc, sold, and became an unexpected hit. Although the story was thought to be apocryphal, Armstrong himself confirmed it in at least one interview as well as in his memoirs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2007/08/22/13829155/louis-armstrong-the-singer|title=NPR's Jazz Profiles from NPR: Louis Armstrong: The Singer |newspaper=NPR |publisher=National Public Radio |access-date=June 16, 2021}}</ref> On a later recording, Armstrong also sang out \"I done forgot the words\" in the middle of recording \"I'm A Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas\".\n\nSuch records were hits and scat singing became a major part of his performances. Long before this, however, Armstrong was playing around with his vocals, shortening and lengthening phrases, interjecting improvisations, using his voice as creatively as his trumpet.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/> Armstrong once told [[Cab Calloway]] that his scat style was derived \"from the Jews ''rockin''\", an Orthodox Jewish style of chanting during prayer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://forward.com/culture/197338/louis-armstrongs-secret-lessons-from-judaism/|title=Louis Armstrong's Secret Lessons From Judaism|work=The Forward|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/louisarmstrong00laur|title=Louis Armstrong: An Extravagant Life|last=Bergreen|first=Laurence|year=1998|publisher=Broadway Books|isbn=978-0-7679-0156-7|edition=Reprint|location=New York|language=en|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===Composing===\nArmstrong was a gifted composer who wrote more than fifty songs, some of which have become [[jazz standards]] (e.g. \"Gully Low Blues\", \"Potato Head Blues\" and \"Swing That Music\").\n\n===Colleagues and followers===\n[[File:Satchmo Messuhallissa.jpg|thumb|With [[Jack Teagarden]] (left) and [[Barney Bigard]] (right), Armstrong plays the trumpet in [[Helsinki, Finland]], October 1949.]]\nDuring his long career he played and sang with some of the most important instrumentalists and vocalists of the time; among them were Bing Crosby, [[Duke Ellington]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Bessie Smith]] and perhaps most famously [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. His influence upon Crosby is particularly important with regard to the subsequent development of popular music: Crosby admired and copied Armstrong, as is evident on many of his early recordings, notably \"Just One More Chance\" (1931).<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/> The ''New Grove Dictionary of Jazz'' describes Crosby's debt to Armstrong in precise detail, although it does not acknowledge Armstrong by name:\n\n{{blockquote|Crosby ... was important in introducing into the mainstream of popular singing an Afro-American concept of song as a lyrical extension of speech ... His techniques\u2014easing the weight of the breath on the vocal cords, passing into a [[head voice]] at a low register, using forward production to aid distinct [[enunciation]], singing on consonants (a practice of black singers), and making discreet use of [[appoggiatura]]s, [[mordent]]s, and [[slur (music)|slurs]] to emphasize the text\u2014were emulated by nearly all later popular singers.}}\n\nArmstrong recorded two albums with Ella Fitzgerald: ''[[Ella and Louis]]'', and ''[[Ella and Louis Again]]'' for [[Verve Records]], with the sessions featuring the backing musicianship of the [[Oscar Peterson]] Trio and drummers [[Buddy Rich]] (on the first album), and [[Louie Bellson]] (on the second). [[Norman Granz]] then had the vision for Ella and Louis to record ''[[Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)|Porgy and Bess]]''.\n\nHis recordings for [[Columbia Records]], ''[[Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy]]'' (1954) and ''Satch Plays Fats'' (all [[Fats Waller]] tunes) (1955) were both being considered masterpieces, as well as moderately well selling. In 1961 the All Stars participated in two albums\u2014''The Great Summit'' and ''The Great Reunion'' (now together as a single disc) with [[Duke Ellington]]. The albums feature many of Ellington's most famous compositions (as well as two exclusive cuts) with Duke sitting in on piano. His participation in [[Dave Brubeck]]'s high-concept jazz musical ''[[The Real Ambassadors]]'' (1963) was critically acclaimed, and features \"Summer Song\", one of Armstrong's most popular vocal efforts.\n\n[[File:Louis Armstrong NYWTS 4.jpg|thumb|upright|Louis Armstrong in 1966]]\n[[List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 1964|In the week beginning May 9, 1964]], his recording of the song \"[[Hello Dolly (song)|Hello, Dolly]]\" went to number one. An [[Hello, Dolly! (Louis Armstrong album)|album of the same title]] was quickly created around the song, and also shot to number one (knocking [[The Beatles]] off the top of the chart). The album sold very well for the rest of the year, quickly going \"Gold\" (500,000). His performance of \"Hello Dolly\" won for best male pop vocal performance at the 1964 [[Grammy Awards]].\n\n===Hits and later career===\nArmstrong had nineteen \"Top Ten\" records<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/308288/louis-armstrong/biography|title=Louis Armstrong|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> including \"[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\", \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\", \"[[When The Saints Go Marching In]]\", \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me (song)|Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\", \"[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]\", \"[[You Rascal You]]\", and \"[[Stompin' at the Savoy]]\". \"[[We Have All the Time in the World]]\" was featured on the soundtrack of the [[James Bond]] film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', and enjoyed renewed popularity in the UK in 1994 when it featured on a [[Guinness]] advertisement. It reached number 3 in the charts on being re-released.\n\nIn 1964, Armstrong knocked [[The Beatles]] off the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart with \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\", which gave the 63-year-old performer a U.S. record as the oldest artist to have a number one song. His 1964 song \"Bout Time\" was later featured in the film ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]''.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/>\n\nIn February 1968, he appeared with Lara Saint Paul on the Italian [[RAI]] television channel where he performed \"Grassa e Bella\", a track he sang in Italian for the Italian market and C.D.I. label.<ref>Louis Armstrong: \"''Grassa e bella''\" [http://michaelminn.net/armstrong/index.php?section8 Louis Armstrong Discography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230507/http://michaelminn.net/armstrong/index.php?section8 |date=January 11, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Armstrong scored one last popular hit in the United Kingdom with \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\", which topped the British charts for a month. Armstrong appeared on the October 28, 1970, ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash Show]]'', where he sang [[Nat King Cole]]'s hit \"[[Ramblin' Rose]]\" and joined Cash to re-create his performance backing Jimmie Rodgers on \"Blue Yodel No. 9\".\n\n===Stylistic range===\nArmstrong enjoyed many types of music, from blues to the arrangements of [[Guy Lombardo]], to Latin American folksongs, to classical symphonies and [[opera]]. He incorporated influences from all these sources into his performances, sometimes to the bewilderment of fans who wanted him to stay in convenient narrow categories. Armstrong was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as an ''early influence''. Some of his solos from the 1950s, such as the [[rock and roll|hard rocking]] version of \"[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]\" from the ''WC Handy'' album, show that the influence went in both directions.<ref name=\"bergreen7\"/>\n\n==Film, television, and radio==\n{{See also|Louis Armstrong filmography}}\n[[File:Louis Armstrong and Grace Kelly on the set of \"High Society\", 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Armstrong entertains [[Grace Kelly]] on the set of ''High Society'' in 1956.]]\n\nArmstrong appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, usually playing a bandleader or musician. His most familiar role was as the bandleader ''cum'' narrator in the 1956 musical ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' starring Bing Crosby, [[Grace Kelly]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Celeste Holm]].

In the 1959 film ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' he played himself, sang, and played several classic numbers.

His irrepressible personality both as a performer and as a public figure was so strong that to some it sometimes overshadowed his contributions as a musician and singer.\n\nAs a virtuoso trumpet player, Armstrong had a unique tone and an extraordinary talent for melodic [[improvisation]]. Through his playing, the trumpet emerged as a solo instrument in jazz and is used widely today. Additionally, jazz itself was transformed from a collectively improvised folk music to a soloist's serious art form largely through his influence. He was a masterful accompanist and ensemble player in addition to his extraordinary skills as a soloist. With his innovations, he raised the bar musically for all who came after him.\n\nThough Armstrong is widely recognized as a pioneer of scat singing, [[Ethel Waters]] precedes his scatting on record in the 1930s according to [[Gary Giddins]] and others.<ref>See ''Ken Burns' Jazz'' CD Set liner notes.</ref> Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra are just two singers who were greatly indebted to him. Holiday said that she always wanted [[Bessie Smith]]'s 'big' sound and Armstrong's feeling in her singing. Even special musicians like Duke Ellington have praised Armstrong through strong testimonials. Duke Ellington, [[DownBeat]] magazine in 1971, said, \"If anybody was a master, it was Louis Armstrong. He was and will continue to be the embodiment of jazz.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40FU7dEiB78C&q=%22%22If%20anybody%20was%20a%20master,%20it%20was%20Louis%20Armstrong.%22%22&pg=PA168|title=Jazz Meets the World-the World Meets Jazz|last=Storb|first=Ilse|date=2000|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=978-3-8258-3748-8|language=en}}</ref> In 1950, [[Bing Crosby]], the most successful vocalist of the first half of the 20th century, said, \"He is the beginning and the end of music in America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/reviews/010211.11gottlit.html|title=A Long Way From Tacoma|website=movies2.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-09-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2001, in commemoration of the centennial of Armstrong's birth, New Orleans's main airport was renamed [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]].
