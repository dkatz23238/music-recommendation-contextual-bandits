Scoring 23 [[UK top 40]] singles and 19 UK top 40 albums to date in a career spanning five decades, the Stranglers are one of the longest-surviving bands to have originated in the UK punk scene.\n\nFormed as the Guildford Stranglers in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], in early 1974,{{sfn|Buckley|1997|page=23}} they originally built a following within the mid-1970s [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] scene. While their aggressive, no-compromise attitude had them identified by the media with the emerging UK [[punk rock]] scene that followed, their idiosyncratic approach rarely followed any single [[musical genre]], and the group went on to explore a variety of musical styles, from [[new wave music|new wave]], [[art rock]] and [[gothic rock]] through the [[sophisti-pop]] of some of their 1980s output. They had major mainstream success with their 1982 single \"[[Golden Brown]]\". Their other hits include \"[[No More Heroes (The Stranglers song)|No More Heroes]]\", \"[[Peaches (The Stranglers song)|Peaches]]\", \"[[Always the Sun]]\", \"[[Skin Deep (The Stranglers song)|Skin Deep]]\" and \"[[Big Thing Coming]]\".\n\nThe Stranglers' early sound was driven by [[Jean-Jacques Burnel]]'s melodic bass, but also gave prominence to [[Dave Greenfield]]'s keyboards. \nTheir early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] lyrics of both Burnel and [[Hugh Cornwell]].<ref>{{Citation\n| last  = Hasted\n| first = Nick\n| date  = 6 November 2007\n| title = The Stranglers, Roundhouse, London\n| work = [[The Independent]]\n| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/the-stranglers-roundhouse-london-399216.html\n}}</ref> Over time, their output gradually grew more refined and sophisticated. Summing up their contribution to popular music, critic Dave Thompson later wrote: \"From bad-mannered [[yobbo|yobs]] to purveyors of supreme pop delicacies, the group was responsible for music that may have been ugly and might have been crude \u2013 but it was never, ever boring.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5542/biography|pure_url=yes}}\n| title = Biography\n| access-date = 25 May 2008\n| last = Thompson\n| first = Dave\n| format = DLL\n| work=The Stranglers\n| publisher=allmusic\n}}</ref>\n\nKeyboard player Dave Greenfield died on 3 May 2020 after contracting [[COVID-19]] while receiving treatment for a heart ailment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestranglers.co.uk/?p=16131|title=Stranglers Official Site \u203a David Paul Greenfield (29/3/49-3/5/20)|website=www.thestranglers.co.uk}}</ref> The remaining band members completed a new album recorded with Greenfield, ''[[Dark Matters (The Stranglers album)|Dark Matters]]'' following his death and confirmed that they would proceed with their \"Final Full UK Tour\", initially announced in January 2020, in his honour.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stranglers Official Site \u203a UK tour autumn/winter 2020|url=http://www.thestranglers.co.uk/?p=16044|access-date=2020-09-15|website=www.thestranglers.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestranglers.co.uk/?p=16169/|title=Stranglers Official Site \u203a Full Final UK Tour And Album Update|website=www.thestranglers.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and mainstream success (1974\u20131979)===\nBefore forming the band, \"[[Jet Black]]\" (real name Brian Duffy) was in his mid-30s.

The Stranglers came to be an influential band in the British punk and new wave scene of the mid-70s.

Meanwhile, the band received a mixed reception from some critics because of their apparent sexist and racist innuendo. However, critic Dave Thompson argued that such criticism was oblivious to the satire and irony in the band's music, writing: \"the Stranglers themselves revelled in an almost [[Monty Python]]-esque grasp of [[surreal humour|absurd]]ity (and, in particular, the absurdities of modern 'men's talk').\"<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5542/biography|pure_url=yes}}\n| title = The Stranglers' biography at ''allmusic.com''\n| author=Thompson, Dave\n| access-date = 10 September 2006\n}}</ref>\nThese albums went on to build a strong fan-following, but the group's confrontational attitude towards the press was increasingly problematic and triggered a severe backlash when Burnel, a martial arts enthusiast, punched music journalist [[Jon Savage]] during a promotional event.{{sfn|Buckley|1997|page=99}}\n\nIn February 1978 the Stranglers began a mini-tour, playing three secret pub gigs as a thank-you to those venues and their landlords for their support during the band's rise to success.

Later that year the Stranglers released ''[[The Raven (The Stranglers album)|The Raven]]'', which heralded a transition towards a more melodic and complex sound which appealed more to the album than the singles market. The songs on ''The Raven'' are multi-layered and musically complicated, and deal with such subjects as a [[Viking]]'s lonely voyage, heroin addiction, genetic engineering, contemporary political events in Iran and Australia and extraterrestrial visitors, [[Men in black|\"Meninblack\"]]. ''The Raven'' saw a definite transition in the band's sound. The [[Hohner]] [[Cembalet]] \u2013 so prominent on the previous three albums \u2013 was dropped and [[Oberheim]] synthesizers used instead whilst acoustic piano was used on \"Don't Bring Harry\". A harmonizer was used to treat Burnel's vocal on the track \"Meninblack\", the recording of which led to [[Martin Rushent]], who had produced their earlier albums, walking out leaving the band to co-produce the album themselves with [[Alan Winstanley]].{{sfn|Cornwell|Drury|2001|page=131}}   \n{{Quotation|We're never going to use a producer again.

''The Raven'' sold well, reaching No.4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] - it spawned one top 20 single, \"[[Duchess (The Stranglers song)|Duchess]]\", with \"Nuclear Device\" reaching No.36 and the [[Extended play|EP]] \"Don't Bring Harry\" reaching No.41. This was followed by a non-album single, \"Bear Cage\", backed with \"Shah Shah a Go Go\" from ''The Raven''. A 12-inch single, the band's first, containing extended mixes of both tracks was also released, but \"Bear Cage\" also only managed No.36 in the charts.\n\nFollowing the success of the Stranglers' previous four albums they were given complete freedom for their next, ''[[The Gospel According to the Meninblack]]'', a [[concept album]] exploring religion and the supposed connection between religious phenomena and extraterrestrial visitors. It was preceded by a single \"Who Wants the World\", which didn't appear on the album, and only just made the top 40. The album also included \"Waltzinblack\" which became adopted as a theme by TV chef [[Keith Floyd]]. ''The Gospel According to The Meninblack'' was very different from their earlier work and alienated many fans.{{sfn|Buckley|1997|page=174}} It peaked on the UK albums chart at No.8, their lowest placing to date, and in 1981 was widely considered an artistic and commercial failure.{{sfn|Buckley|1997|page=174}} The track \"Two Sunspots\" had been recorded during the ''Black And White'' sessions in 1978, but was shelved until 1980 when it was rediscovered and placed on ''The Gospel According to the Meninblack''. The \"Meninblack\" track from ''The Raven'' is the \"Two Sunspots\" soundtrack slowed down.{{sfn|Cornwell|Drury|2001|page=131}}\n\nAfter a slow start, the Stranglers recovered their commercial and critical status with ''[[La folie (album)|La Folie]]'' (1981) which was another concept album, this time exploring the subject of love. At first ''La Folie'' charted lower than any other Stranglers studio album, and the first single taken from it, \"Let Me Introduce You to the Family\", only charted at No.42. However, the next single was \"[[Golden Brown]]\". The song is an evocative waltz-time ballad, with an extra beat in the fourth bar. Cornwell said the lyrics were \"about heroin and also about a girl. She was of [[Mediterranean]] origin and her skin was golden brown.\"{{sfn|Cornwell|Drury|2001|page=215}} It became their biggest hit, charting at No.2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It was also named as \"record of the week\" on [[BBC Radio 2]], despite the station not previously playing music associated with the punk genre. It remains a radio staple to this day. Following this success, ''La Folie'' recharted at No.11 in the UK albums chart.  \"[[Tramp (Stranglers song)|Tramp]]\" was originally thought to be the ideal follow-up single to \"Golden Brown\"; however \"La Folie\" was chosen after Burnel convinced his bandmates of its potential.{{sfn|Cornwell|Drury|2001|page=223}} Sung in French, it received negligible airplay and charted at No.47. Shortly afterwards the Stranglers left EMI. As part of their severance deal, the Stranglers were forced to release a greatest hits collection, ''[[The Collection 1977\u20131982]]''.{{sfn|Cornwell|Drury|2001|page=217}} The track listing for ''The Collection 1977\u20131982'' included the new single \"[[Strange Little Girl]]\", which had originally been recorded on a demo in '74 and rejected by EMI. It became a hit, charting at No.7 in July 1982.\n\n===New label and sound (1983\u20131990)===\nFollowing the Stranglers' return to commercial success, many record companies lined up to sign them. [[Virgin Records]] was the most likely choice but [[Epic Records]] made a last minute offer and secured the Stranglers' services. The Stranglers once again had complete artistic freedom and in 1983 released their first album for Epic, ''[[Feline (The Stranglers album)|Feline]]'', which included the UK No.&nbsp;9 hit \"[[European Female]]\". The album was another change in musical direction, this time influenced by European music. It was the first Stranglers album to feature acoustic guitars, and it was on this album that Jet Black began to use electronic drum kits.{{sfn|Cornwell|Drury|2001|page=227}} Hugh Cornwell stated, \"On ''La Folie'' there were three tracks \u2013 'Golden Brown' ... 'La Folie' and 'How to Find True Love and Happiness in the Present Day' \u2013 that sort of pointed us away from what we had been doing. It was strange doing those tracks, because we'd never really attempted that quite minimalistic recording technique. And when we started writing for ''Feline'', things were coming out the same way.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burton|first=Nick |title=Lean and Hungry Stranglers Protest the High-Tech Age|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2 |issue=8|page=8}}</ref> The album gained much critical success but fell well short of ''La Folie'' in terms of sales and failed to produce another hit after \"European Female\". Nonetheless ''Feline'' broke the Stranglers in Europe and reached No.4 in the UK chart in January 1983.\n\n1984 saw the release of ''[[Aural Sculpture]]'' which consolidated the band's success in Europe and established them in [[Oceania]]. It included the UK No.15 hit \"[[Aural Sculpture|Skin Deep]]\" (which also reached No. 11 in Australia and No.&nbsp;19 in New Zealand, and Top 30 in the Netherlands). This was their first album to feature the three-piece horn-section which was retained in all their subsequent albums and live performances until Hugh Cornwell's departure in 1990. ''Aural Sculpture'' was only a moderate success in the UK album charts, peaking at No.14 in November 1984.\n\nTheir 1986 album, ''[[Dreamtime (The Stranglers album)|Dreamtime]]'', dealt with environmental concerns among other issues. Its signature track, and another radio staple for many years to come, was \"[[Always the Sun]]\" (a No.15 hit in France and No.16 hit in Ireland, No.21 in Australia, No.30 in the UK, and No.42 in the Netherlands). The only Stranglers album to chart in the US, ''Dreamtime'' was again only a moderate hit in the UK, reaching No.&nbsp;16 in November 1986.\n\nThe Stranglers' final album with Cornwell, ''[[10 (The Stranglers album)|10]]'', was released in 1990. This was recorded with the intention of building on their \"cult\" status in America. Following the success of their cover of [[The Kinks]]' \"[[All Day and All of the Night]]\", a UK No.&nbsp;7 hit in 1988, the Stranglers released another '60s cover, \"[[96 Tears]]\" as their first single from ''10''; it reached No.&nbsp;17 in the UK. Despite this success, the follow-up single \"Sweet Smell of Success\" only reached No.65. \"Man of the Earth\", which the band had high hopes for, was due to be the third single from the album, however Epic Records decided against it. In August 1990, Hugh Cornwell abruptly left Stranglers to pursue a solo career, following the band's failure to attain a tour in the US.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cornwell |first1=Hugh |title=A Multitude of Sins |date=2005 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-0-00733356-1 |page=17}}</ref> In his autobiography, Cornwell stated that he felt that the Stranglers were a spent force creatively, and cited various examples of his increasingly acrimonious relationship with his fellow band-members, particularly Burnel.\n\n===Post-Cornwell era (1990s)===\nFollowing the departure of Cornwell, CBS-Sony dropped Stranglers from their roster. The remaining members recruited [[John Ellis (guitarist)|John Ellis]], who had had a long-standing association with the band. He had opened for them in the 1970s as a member of [[The Vibrators]], filled in for Cornwell during his time in prison for drug possession in 1980, worked with Burnel and Greenfield in their side-project Purple Helmets, and been added to the Stranglers' line-up as a touring guitarist a short time before Cornwell's departure. Burnel and Ellis briefly took over vocal duties (for one television appearance on ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]'') before enlisting [[Paul Roberts (musician)|Paul Roberts]], who sang on most songs live, even those originally sung by Burnel.\n\nThis line-up recorded four albums: ''[[Stranglers in the Night]]'' (1992), ''[[About Time (The Stranglers album)|About Time]]'' (1995), ''[[Written in Red]]'' (1997) and ''[[Coup de Grace (The Stranglers album)|Coup de Grace]]'' (1998).\n\n===2000s resurgence and reversion to a four-piece===\nIn 2000, Ellis left the band and a new guitarist, [[Baz Warne]], was recruited.\n\nThe Stranglers achieved something of a critical and popular renaissance in 2004<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peacock |first1=Tim |title=The Old Testament: The UA Studio Recordings 1977-1982|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/album/the-old-testament-the-ua-studio-recordings-1977-1982 |website=Record Collector |publisher=Diamond Publishing |access-date=8 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Ian |title=The Stranglers, Salisbury City Hall |url=https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/leisure/music/10319941.the-stranglers-salisbury-city-hall/ |website=The Daily Echo |publisher=Newsquest Media |access-date=8 October 2021}}</ref> with the album ''[[Norfolk Coast (album)|Norfolk Coast]]'' and a subsequent sell-out tour, together with their first Top-40 hit (No.&nbsp;31 UK) in fourteen years, \"[[Big Thing Coming]]\". The album also included ''Tuckers Grave'' about a Somerset cider house named after the victim of a suicide in a nearby farm which members of the band now occupied. In 2005, ''Coast to Coast: Live on Tour'' was released, the live album contained songs recorded during their tour the previous year. On their sellout UK tour they were supported by [[Goldblade]].\n\nIn May 2006, Roberts left the band, and the Stranglers were now back to a four-piece line-up: Burnel, Black, Greenfield and Warne, with the lead vocals shared between Warne and Burnel. In concert, Burnel returned to singing the songs he originally recorded as lead vocalist, and Warne sang the numbers originally led by Hugh Cornwell.\n\n''[[Suite XVI]]'', the follow-up album to ''Norfolk Coast'', was released in September 2006 (the title is a pun on \"Sweet 16\" and also a reference to the fact that it was the band's sixteenth studio album) and continued the band's resurgence. Although partly a return to the band's heavier punk roots, the album featured a typically idiosyncratic mixture of musical styles which included a country and western style Johnny Cash pastiche/homage \"I Hate You\".\n\nIn 2007 it was reported that drummer Black was suffering from [[atrial fibrillation]], an ailment which subsequently forced him to miss a number of shows, particularly where extended travel was required.
