Debut album ''Exit Planet Dust'' (1995) has sold a million copies worldwide. After attracting [[Virgin Records]], the duo achieved further success with second album ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]'' (1997), which topped the [[UK Albums Chart|UK charts]]. In the UK, they have had six No. 1 albums and 13 top-20 singles, including two chart-toppers. \n\nTheir name came about in 1995 after they dropped their original moniker The Dust Brothers due to the [[Dust Brothers|existence of a different band with the same name]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=137}}</ref> In the United States, they have won six [[Grammy Award]]s including [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]], [[Best Dance Recording]] and [[Best Dance/Electronic Album]] of the year as recently as 2020.<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/grammy-winners-2020-the-full-list.html Grammy Winners List 2020] by Zoe Haylock, Vulture.com, January 27, 2020.</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== 1984\u20131995: Formation and early incarnations ===\n'''Ed Simons''' was born the son of a [[barrister]] mother and a father he has described as \"absent\".<ref name=\"The Face\">{{cite magazine|url=https://theface.com/music/the-chemical-brothers-archive-1997-techno-dig-your-own-hole |first= Sylvia |last= Patterson |title= The Chemical World |magazine=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]] |date= April 1997 |access-date= 5 September 2021 }}</ref> After finishing an \"expensive\" [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] with 11 [[General Certificate of Education|O]] levels and three [[A level]]s, he continued on to study history, especially late medieval history, at the [[University of Manchester]].<ref name=\"The Face\"></ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/Ed+Simons-33297.html|title=Ed Simons' history lessons|last=June 2010|first=26|website=Femalefirst.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\n'''Tom Rowlands''' was raised in [[Henley-on-Thames]].

Their first single was \"Sea of Beats\", which was essentially a [[white label]]. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was \"Bokadilo\". Other songs, released on [[Gramophone record|12-inch]], included \"Mustn't Grumble\" and their best-known, \"Rollercoaster\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the [[record label]] [[Deconstruction Records|deConstruction]]. They insisted on a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman [[Sally Ann Marsh]], and after some disappointing songs such as \"Let It Slide\" (Rowlands would later describe it as \"a stinker\"), the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song \"T Baby\", which was remixed by the pair. \n\nRowlands and Simons started to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at a club called Naked Under Leather in the back of a pub in 1992,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> under the alias, the 237 Turbo Nutters<ref name=\":0\" /> (named after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn [[Rave culture|raving]] days). The pair would play hip hop, [[Techno music|techno]], and [[House music|house]].<ref>''Brothers Gonna Work It Out'' (XDUSTCD 101) booklet, page 2.</ref> The two called themselves '''the Dust Brothers'''<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> after [[Dust Brothers|the US production duo]], famous for their work with the [[Beastie Boys]]. After a while, Rowlands and Simons began to run out of suitable [[instrumental hip hop]] tracks to use, so they started to make their own. Using a [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] [[hi-fi]] system, an [[Atari ST]], a [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], and a keyboard, they recorded \"Song to the Siren\", which sampled [[This Mortal Coil]].<ref name=\"wb-guardian-beat-generation\">{{cite web|date=1999-06-12|title=Beat Generation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jun/12/weekend7.weekend6}}</ref> \"Song to the Siren\" was released on their own record label, which they called Diamond Records (after Ed's nickname). At this point the Dust Brothers were the first-ever backroom DJs in the Sumptuous Locarno Lounge at The Job Club in Gossips night club in [[Dean Street, Soho]] from April 1992 till April 1993. \n\nIn October 1992, they pressed 500 white-label copies and took them to dance-record shops around London, but all refused to play it, saying it was too slow (the track played at 111 [[beats per minute|BPM]]). They sent a copy to London DJ [[Andrew Weatherall]], who made it a permanent fixture in his DJ sets. In May 1993, Junior Boy's Own released \"Song to the Siren\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nAround June 1993, the Dust Brothers recorded their first [[remix]]es. The first was \"Packet of Peace\" for [[Justin Robertson]]'s [[Lionrock]] group, followed by songs from [[Leftfield]], [[Republica]], and [[the Sandals]]. Later in 1993, Rowlands and Simons completed work on their ''[[Fourteenth Century Sky]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], released in January 1994.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It contained the groundbreaking \"Chemical Beats\", which epitomised the duo's genre-defining [[big beat]] sound.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The [[EP (music CD)|EP]] also contained \"One Too Many Mornings\", which for the first time showed their less intense, more chilled-out side. Both \"One Too Many Mornings\" and \"Chemical Beats\" would later appear on their debut album. ''Fourteenth Century Sky'' was followed later in 1994 by the ''[[My Mercury Mouth EP]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Chemical Beats\" was also part of the soundtrack for the first edition of the ''[[Wipeout (game)|Wipeout]]'' video game series, having been featured in ''Wipeout'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1995.\n\nIn October 1994, the Dust Brothers became resident DJs at the small but influential [[Heavenly Recordings#The Social|Heavenly Sunday Social Club]] at the Albany pub in London's [[Great Portland Street]].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[James Dean Bradfield]], and [[Tim Burgess (musician)|Tim Burgess]] were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers were subsequently asked to remix tracks by [[Manic Street Preachers]] and [[The Charlatans (British band)|the Charlatans]], plus [[Primal Scream]]'s \"Jailbird\" and [[the Prodigy]]'s \"[[Voodoo People]]\". These two remixes received television exposure, being playlisted by [[MTV]] Europe's \"The Party Zone\" in 1995. \n\nEarly in 1994, the Dust Brothers were approached in the club one Sunday by Gallagher from [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who were becoming one of the most prominent guitar bands in Britain. Gallagher told the duo that he had a [[Balearic beat|Balearic]]-inspired track he had written that he would like them to remix. However, over time, Gallagher changed his mind, and in the end the Brothers did not remix it.\n\nIn March 1995, the Dust Brothers began their first international tour, which included the United States \u2013 where they played with [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] and [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] \u2013 then a series of European festivals. Also around this time, objections were filed by [[Dust Brothers|the original Dust Brothers]] over the use of their name, and so Rowlands and Simons had to decide on a new name.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> They decided to call themselves the Chemical Brothers after \"Chemical Beats\".\n\nIn June 1995, they released their fourth single, the first under their new identity. \"Leave Home\" was released on Junior Boy's Own, as a preview of the imminent debut album and became the band's first chart hit, peaking at No. 17.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u20131998: ''Exit Planet Dust'' and ''Dig Your Own Hole'' ===\nIn July 1995, the Chemical Brothers released their debut album ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]'' (the title inspired by their name change) on Freestyle Dust/Junior Boy's Own. It entered the UK charts at No. 9<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and featured guest vocalist [[Beth Orton]] on the song \"Alive Alone\". It eventually went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, and was used on the soundtrack of the [[science fiction]] TV series pilot ''[[Virtuality (TV series)|Virtuality]]''. Shortly after its release, the Chemical Brothers signed to [[Virgin Records]], to which they took their own offshoot label, Freestyle Dust. For their next single, \"[[Life Is Sweet (song)|Life Is Sweet]]\", released in September 1995, they again used a guest vocalist, featuring their friend Tim Burgess, singer of the Charlatans. It reached No. 25 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The single was also ''Select'' magazine's \"Single of the Month\" for October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsgallery.com/prodtype.asp?strParents=&CAT_ID=399&numRecordPosition=1|title=The Chemical Brothers Soundwaves Art|website=Stpaulsgallery.com|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> The release included a [[Daft Punk]] remix of \"Life Is Sweet\".\n\nIn October 1995, the duo returned to the Heavenly Sunday Social for a second and final run of DJ dates. They then became residents of Heavenly Social on Saturdays at Turnmills and also in Liquid Rooms in Tokyo. In November, the Chemical Brothers played the [[Astoria Theatre]] in London. The duo also supported [[The Prodigy]] in December on dates at [[Brixton Academy]] and in Blackpool. \n\nIn January 1996, ''Exit Planet Dust'' was certified gold. The Chemical Brothers released their first new material in six months on Virgin, the ''Loops of Fury'' EP. The four-track release was limited to 20,000 copies, but is now available for digital download. It entered the UK charts at No. 13. ''[[NME]]'' described the lead track as \"splashing waves of synths across hard-hitting beats\". The EP also contained a Dave Clarke remix of \"Chemical Beats\", and two other new tracks, \"Get Up on It Like This\" and \"(The Best Part Of) Breaking Up\".\n\nIn February 1996, ''Select'' magazine published a list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s thus far. ''Exit Planet Dust'' was listed at Number 39. In August 1996, the Chemical Brothers supported Oasis at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], where 125,000 people attended each of the two shows.\n\nDuring the 1995 [[Glastonbury Festival]], Rowlands and Simons had another conversation with [[Noel Gallagher]]. Gallagher told them how much he liked ''Exit Planet Dust'', and asked if he could sing on a future track, similar to the way [[Tim Burgess (musician)|Tim Burgess]] had worked on \"Life Is Sweet\". They did not think much of the offer at the time, given how busy Gallagher would be with the release of Oasis' ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', plus the complexities of dealing with each other's record companies. However, the duo later worked on a track they thought would benefit from a vocal. They sent Gallagher a tape of what they had done so far. He worked on it overnight, and left a message early next morning that he was ready to record it. The track was called \"[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]\" and was finally released in October 1996. It entered the UK charts at the top, giving the duo their first ever Number One single.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Setting Sun\" was backed by a longer instrumental version, and also a new track \"Buzz Tracks\", which was not much more than a DJ tool. The three remaining members of the Beatles' lawyers later wrote to the Chemical Brothers, mistakenly claiming they had sampled \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\". Virgin Records hired a [[Musicology|musicologist]] to prove they did not sample the song.\n\nIn 1996, ''[[Live at the Social Volume 1]]'' was released by [[Heavenly Records]], which became the Chemical Brothers' first mix CD (excluding ''Xmas Dust Up'', a free album that came in a 1994 issue of ''NME''). It was also the duo's first live album (excluding the EP ''[[Live 05]]'').\n\nIn March 1997, the Chemical Brothers released the second track from their forthcoming album. \"[[Block-Rockin' Beats]]\" went straight to No. 1 in the UK, possibly thanks, this time, to its [[Schoolly D]] vocal sample and re-working of the bass-line from [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s single \"Coup\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsng.net/samplesources.htm |title=Sample Sources |work=dsng.net |access-date=24 September 2011}}</ref> The ''NME'' named it \"Single of the Week\" and said: \"It throbs like your head might if you had just done a length underwater in a swimming pool full of [[Alkyl nitrites|amyl]].\" It later won them a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1997&genre=31 |title=Grammy Awards : Past Winners Search |website=Grammy.com|access-date=2014-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the US at this time, \"Setting Sun\" was sitting at Number 80 in the Billboard Top 100, after selling around 80,000 copies, an uncommon achievement for a European \"dance\" act. Sales from ''Exit Planet Dust'' were also around 150,000.\n\nOn 7 April 1997, the Chemical Brothers released their second album, ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]''. It was recorded at the band's own south London studio, with the title taken from graffiti on the wall outside. The album was well received,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |title=Dig Your Own Hole: The Chemical Brothers: Review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=3 April 1997 |access-date=12 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116081718/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |archive-date=16 January 2009 }}</ref> with ''Mixmag'' rating it 10/10 and calling it \"mad enough to be thrilling, slick enough for not even remotely trendy coffee tables\".\n\nDuring the summer of 1997, the Chemical Brothers toured extensively, particularly in the United States. In August, the Chemical Brothers achieved a rapprochement with the US Dust Brothers, and asked them to remix the forthcoming single \"[[Elektrobank]]\". They themselves also became highly sought-after for remixes for other artists. In September, the next single from ''Dig Your Own Hole'', \"Elektrobank\" was released. In November, the pair played at Dublin's Point Theatre, with support from [[Carl Cox]]. They also began a US tour in Detroit.\n\nAt the end of the year, ''Dig Your Own Hole''{{'}}s final track, the nine-minute-long \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\", gave rise to a limited-edition mini-EP of the same name. The [[B-side]] consisted of a live version of \"Setting Sun\", recorded at the [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands Festival]], Netherlands on 24 August 1997. Also in December, following four sold-out US shows, the Chemical Brothers toured the UK, concluding in a sold-out show at Brixton Academy, London.\n\nIn 1998, they concentrated more on DJing, although some remixes did see the light of day, including \"I Think I'm in Love\" from [[Spiritualized]]. Both a vocal remix and an instrumental remix were included in the single release. Each clocked in at over seven-and-a-half minutes. Another remix completed by the Chemical Brothers was \"Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp\" by [[Mercury Rev]]. This was another extension in the association between the two bands, since Mercury Rev's Jonathon Donahue contributed to \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\" on ''Dig Your Own Hole''.\n\nIn September 1998, a second mix album, ''[[Brothers Gonna Work It Out]]'', was released. It contains some of their own tracks and remixes, as well as songs from artists who have influenced their sound, such as [[Renegade Soundwave]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], Carlos \"After Dark\" Berrios, and [[Kenny 'Dope' Gonzales]].\n\n=== 1999\u20132002: ''Surrender'' and ''Come with Us'' ===\nIn May 1999, the Chemical Brothers played three UK dates, their first since December 1997. Also that month, they released their first new original material in two years, a track called \"[[Hey Boy Hey Girl]]\". This was more [[house music|house]]-influenced than big beat. In interviews at the time, Rowlands and Simons indicated that the track was inspired by nights out at Sheffield club Gatecrasher. The track was also one of their more commercially accessible tracks and went to number 3 in the UK charts.\n\nTheir third album, ''[[Surrender (The Chemical Brothers album)|Surrender]]'', was released in June 1999. It featured vocals from Noel Gallagher, Mercury Rev's [[Jonathan Donahue]], and [[Mazzy Star]]'s [[Hope Sandoval]]. As \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\" had suggested, the album was more house-oriented than the previous two. On one of the album's stand out tracks, \"Out of Control\", [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] supported by [[Primal Scream]]'s [[Bobby Gillespie]] provided vocals. It reached No. 1 in the UK album charts. The [[Michel Gondry]]-directed [[music video]] for \"[[Let Forever Be]]\", which utilised ground-breaking video and film effects in its depiction of a young woman's nightmares, also received a lot of attention.\n\nLater that summer, the Chemical Brothers performed at the [[Woodstock '99]] concert on 24 July, with positive reception. They later headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] dance tent on the Friday night, followed by a UK tour which ended in December and included [[Homelands (festival)|Homelands]] Scotland on 4 September. In November, \"Out of Control\", featuring Sumner and Gillespie on vocals, was released as a single. The release also contained the [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] remix. The final single from ''Surrender'', in February 2000, was the five track \"Music: Response\" EP, containing the title track and two remixes, plus [[Electronic Battle Weapon]] 4, named \"Freak of the Week\", and a track called \"Enjoyed\", which was essentially a remix of \"Out of Control\" by the Chemical Brothers themselves. A CD copy of ''Surrender'' was placed in the third ''[[Blue Peter]]'' [[time capsule]], buried in January 2000. That same month, they appeared on Primal Scream's album ''[[Xtrmntr]]'' at track 11 with a remix.\n\nIn June 2000, they played the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival. In August 2000 they played to a large crowd at the main stage at [[Creamfields]] festival, Ireland. In December 2000, the Chemical Brothers aired one of their new tracks, \"It Began in Afrika\" at their New York DJ gigs, supporting [[U2]].\n\nIn 2001, they were active with releases and live performances. Early in the year, they began working on a fourth album, provisionally titled ''Chemical Four''. The first track which fans got a taste of was \"It Began in Afrika\", as previously played in their DJ set in New York. The track would make its live debut in California in April 2001, at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. Another new track, \"Galaxy Bounce\", also got its public debut at Coachella. As had become customary for their releases and experiments, \"It Began in Afrika\" was first pressed as a promo, as part of the \"[[Electronic Battle Weapon]]\" series. It received much airplay on dance music radio shows in the UK, and became more and more popular in clubs over the course of the summer. It also became one of the \"anthems\" in Ibiza as the summer progressed. It was given a full commercial single release in September, reaching No. 8 in the UK singles chart, even though no promotional video was made for the track.\n\nRowlands and Simons also remixed a track from [[Fatboy Slim]]'s ''[[Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars]]'', entitled \"Song for Shelter\". This remix was released as a single on 3 September 2001 (one week before \"It Began in Afrika\") as the CD2 single for \"[[Song for Shelter / Ya Mama]]\". It reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Charts (sales were combined with the CD1 single).\n\nThe Chemical Brothers finished work on another album, ''[[Come with Us]]'', in October 2001. It featured collaborations with [[Richard Ashcroft]] of [[the Verve]] (\"The Test\"), and long-time collaborator [[Beth Orton]] (\"The State We're In\"). The album was released in January 2002, preceded by a single, \"Star Guitar\", a melodic [[Balearic beat]] number, with a promotional video by [[Michel Gondry]] that featured passing scenery synchronised to the beat viewed through a train window. What would be the second track on the album, \"It Began in Afrika\", was released 10 September 2001 to be circulated around the clubbing scene where it was a popular hit. \"Star Guitar\" was also released as a [[DVD]] single, the pair's first. ''Come with Us'', was less well received than their previous albums, but nonetheless went straight to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart in the first week of its release, selling 100,000 copies. In April, the title track from the album was released as a single with remixes by [[Fatboy Slim]] as part of a double A-sided release with \"The Test\".\n\nDuring the summer of 2002, the Chemical Brothers travelled the festival circuit to promote the album. Later in 2002, they released two EPs, one specifically aimed at Japan and the other the US (entitled ''[[AmericanEP]]''). Both contained remixes, live versions and B-sides. Additionally, the band produced [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s \"[[Here to Stay (New Order song)|Here to Stay]]\", written for the film ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'' and released as a single to promote the soundtrack, and remixed the song as well. One of their other major songs from this album was \"Galaxy Bounce\", which was popular and featured as the main title music for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Project Gotham Racing (video game)|Project Gotham Racing]]''. It was also included on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. \"Star Guitar\" was featured as a song on the [[PlayStation Portable]]'s ''[[Lumines II]]''.\n\nTwo other songs, \"Come with Us (Introduction)\" and \"[[Star Guitar]] (Title Screen)\", were featured on a [[PlayStation 2]] racing game titled ''WRC II: Extreme''. Both songs are instrumental. The song \"My Elastic Eye\" from the album ''Come with Us'' was played in the 2004 film ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/soundtrack |title=The Butterfly Effect (2004) \u2013 Soundtracks |work=Imdb.com |access-date=24 September 2011}}</ref> starring [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Amy Smart]].\n\n=== 2003\u20132006: ''Push the Button'' ===\nEarly 2003 saw Rowlands and Simons back in the studio working on new material, including \"The Golden Path\", a collaboration with [[Wayne Coyne]] of [[the Flaming Lips]]. This was released in September 2003, at the same time as a \"best of\" album, entitled ''[[Singles 93\u201303]]'', marking ten years of the Chemical Brothers' releases. ''Singles 93\u201303'' included most, but not all, of their singles. A second new track, in addition to \"The Golden Path\", was included on the album, called \"Get Yourself High\". ''Singles 93\u201303'' was also released on DVD, with extra features including selected live performances and interviews with Rowlands, Simons, and many of their collaborators from throughout the period. \"Get Yourself High\", which featured Canadian rapper [[k-os]] on vocals, was released as a single in November 2003.\n\nIn late 2003 and 2004, the Chemical Brothers continued to work in the studio on new material and a remix of \"[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]\" by [[Kylie Minogue]]. After being released on rare white label vinyl, it was subsequently given a commercial release in March on CD (on her next single \"Red Blooded Woman\") and on 12-inch vinyl picture disc (containing two other Minogue remixes). In Summer 2004 they returned to the festival circuit, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], Tokyo, Scotland, and Ireland. They also visited South America for the second time (the first time being in 1999), arriving at Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. It was during these sets that they played new material, including \"Acid Children\", which proved to be one of the most popular new tracks.\n\nIn September 2004, the Chemical Brothers released the seventh \"Electronic Battle Weapon\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 7\" was being released as a one-sided promo-only 12-inch, containing \"Acid Children\". A marked departure from the Chemical Brothers' previous musical endeavours, it featured a screeching 303 bassline and a distinctive vocal sample; a pitch-altered vocal sample proclaiming \"You Are All My Children Now!\", which is lifted from the horror film ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]''. It was coupled with the projection of a sinister clown mouthing these same words at their live gigs.\n\nThe \"Electronic Battle Weapon\" series of promo releases have typically been newly recorded Chemical Brothers tracks, released on promo to allow DJs to test them in a club environment, and to gauge their popularity.\n\nIn 2004, the Chemical Brothers began work on ''[[Push the Button (The Chemical Brothers album)|Push the Button]]'', their fifth studio album, which features collaborations with [[Tim Burgess (musician)|Tim Burgess]], [[Kele Okereke]], and [[Anwar Superstar]], amongst others. The album was released on 24 January 2005.\n\n\"[[Galvanize (song)|Galvanize]]\", which features rapper [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] on vocals, was the first single to be taken from ''Push the Button'', and premiered on [[iTunes]]. The single was released on 17 January 2005, and entered the UK chart at No. 3. The second single, \"[[Believe (Chemical Brothers song)|Believe]]\" (featuring [[Kele Okereke]] from [[Bloc Party]]), failed to crack the top 10, but still made it into the top 20, peaking at No. 18. \"The Boxer\", featuring Tim Burgess, became the duo's first single to fail to crack the top 40.\n\nThe album and single \"Galvanize\" won a Grammy at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006]]. The track \"Surface to Air\" features a pulsing chord progression and bassline reminiscent of the intro to [[the Strokes]] song \"The Modern Age\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Chemical action, crowd reaction|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/Chemical-action-crowd-reaction/2005/01/27/1106415717077.html|work=[[The Age]]|date=28 January 2005|access-date=13 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAn unofficial, remixed version of the album entitled ''Flip the Switch'' was released as a free download, along with the ''Believe'' EP, featuring six further remixes of \"Believe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |title=Flip The Switch \u2013 The Chemical Brothers remixed |access-date=13 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126182108/http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |archive-date=26 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, the Chemical Brothers were revealed as the first musicians to be involved in Tate Tracks.<ref name=\"Moss\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art39863|title=Tate Modern Makes Music With Chemical Brothers For Tate Tracks Project|last=Moss|first=Richard|date=31 August 2006|work=[[Culture24]]|access-date=9 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"TateTracks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tatetracks.org.uk|title=Tate Tracks|year=2006|publisher=[[Tate]]|access-date=9 May 2013}}</ref> [[Tate Modern]] invited various groups and songwriters to choose a work that inspired them from the gallery's collection of modern art and then write a track about it.

The double-sided vinyl was finally released just before the Chemical Brothers' much anticipated New Year's Eve gig at the famous [[Turnmills]] in London. The vinyl had a limited edition release worldwide and was received well by fans, DJs, and critics alike. \"Electronic Battle Weapon 8\", at about six and a half minutes, was very distinct from the \"big acid\" style that the earlier \"Electronic Battle Weapons\" adhered to. It was characterised by 'thundering' drums with a rising synth line. A version of this track featured on the ''We Are the Night'' album and was entitled \"Saturate\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 9\" was a typical Chemicals dancefloor track with their trademark [[vocoder]] vocals coupled with sirens and a basic 'tribal' melody.\n\nAt the same [[Turnmills]] gig, the Brothers also played a previously unreleased song at midnight to welcome 2007, which went down well with the crowd. This track eventually emerged as \"Burst Generator\", found on the forthcoming album ''We Are the Night''. Many were left wondering if the latest in the Electronic Battle Weapon series were simply one-off experiments or signalled a new direction they could take with the new album, perhaps swaying from their genre defining big beat albums of the past. The song was also the band's 100th released song.\n\nOn 21 March 2007, the Chemical Brothers officially announced their forthcoming album on [[MySpace]]. The new album, entitled ''[[We Are the Night (album)|We Are the Night]]'', was released on 2 July 2007 in the United Kingdom and 17 July 2007 in the United States.
