At the beginning of his career as a producer for the [[World Class Wreckin Cru]] with DJ Alonzo Williams in the mid-1980s, his music was in the [[electro-hop]] style pioneered by [[the Unknown DJ]], and that of early hip-hop groups like the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Whodini]].\n\nFrom ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' on, Dre uses live musicians to replay old melodies rather than sampling them. With [[Ruthless Records]], collaborators included guitarist Mike \"Crazy Neck\" Sims, multi-instrumentalist Colin Wolfe, [[DJ Yella]] and sound engineer Donovan \"The Dirt Biker\" Sound. Dre is receptive of new ideas from other producers, one example being his fruitful collaboration with [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]]'s producer [[Cold 187um]] while at Ruthless. Cold 187&nbsp;um was at the time experimenting with 1970s [[P-Funk]] samples ([[Parliament (band)|Parliament]], [[Funkadelic]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] etc.), that Dre also used. Dre has since been accused of \"stealing\" the concept of [[G-funk]] from Cold 187&nbsp;um.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/2012/12/01/on-the-record-and-above-the-law-with-cold187um/|title=AllHipHop \" On the Record and Above the Law With Cold187um|work=AllHipHop|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nUpon leaving Ruthless and forming [[Death Row Records]] in 1991, Dre called on veteran West Coast DJ [[Chris \"The Glove\" Taylor|Chris \"the Glove\" Taylor]] and sound engineer Greg \"Gregski\" Royal, along with Colin Wolfe, to help him on future projects.

In songs such as \"Murder was the Case\" and \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", the synthesizer pitch is higher and the drum tempo is slowed down to 91 BPM<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.audiokeychain.com/track/PUM/snoop-dogg-murder-was-the-case|title=Key and BPM of Snoop Dogg \u2013 Murder Was The Case \u2013 AudioKeychain|work=AudioKeychain}}</ref> (87 BPM in the remix) to create a dark and gritty atmosphere. [[Percussion]] instruments, particularly [[sleigh bell]]s, are also present. Dre's frequent collaborators from this period included [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] natives Stuart \"Stu-B-Doo\" Bullard, a multi-instrumentalist from the Ozanam Strings Orchestra,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://harlemworld.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/the-men-behind-the-man-ii-part-2-stu-b-doo/|title=The Men Behind The Man (ii): Part 2: Stu-B-Doo|work=H World|date=January 29, 2010}}</ref> [[Sam Sneed]], Stephen \"[[Bud'da]]\" Anderson,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://harlemworld.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/the-men-behind-the-man-part-1-budda-no-homo/|title=The men behind the man.

The beat for the [[Houston]]-based group [[Geto Boys]] 1996 song \"Still\" follows the same drum pattern as \"Natural Born Killaz\" and Eazy E's \"Wut Would U Do\" (a diss to Dre) is similar to the original \"Murder was the Case\" instrumental. This style of production is usually accompanied by [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[occult]]-themed lyrics and imagery, being crucial to the creation of [[horrorcore]].\n\nBy 1996, Dre was again looking to innovate his sound. He recruited keyboardist Camara Kambon to play the keys on \"[[Been There, Done That (Dr. Dre song)|Been There, Done That]]\", and through Bud'da and Sam Sneed he was introduced to fellow Pittsburgh native [[Melvin \"Mel-Man\" Bradford]]. At this time, he also switched from using the E-mu SP-1200 to the Akai MPC3000 drum kit and sampler, which he still uses today. Beginning with his 1996 compilation [[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]], Dre's production has taken a less sample-based approach, with loud, layered [[snare drum]]s dominating the mix, while synthesizers are still omnipresent. In his critically acclaimed second album, [[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]], live instrumentation takes the place of sampling, a famous example being \"[[The Next Episode]]\", in which keyboardist Camara Kambon re-played live the main melody from [[David McCallum]]'s 1967 jazz-funk work \"The Edge\". For every song on ''2001'', Dre had a [[keyboardist]], [[guitarist]] and [[bassist]] create the basic parts of the beat, while he himself programmed the [[drums]], did the [[music sequencer|sequencing]] and [[overdubbing]] and added sound effects, and later mixed the songs. During this period, Dre's signature \"west coast whistle\" riffs are still present albeit in a lower pitch, as in \"Light Speed\", \"Housewife\", \"Some L.A. Niggaz\" and Eminem's \"[[Guilty Conscience (song)|Guilty Conscience]]\" hook. The sound of \"2001\" had tremendous influence on hip-hop production, redefining the West Coast's sound and expanding the G-funk of the early 1990s. To produce the album, Dre and Mel-Man relied on the talents of [[Scott Storch]] and Camara Kambon on the keys, [[Mike Elizondo]] and Colin Wolfe on bass guitar, Sean Cruse on lead guitar and sound engineers Richard \"Segal\" Huredia and Mauricio \"Veto\" Iragorri.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Dr-Dre-2001-/release/6149535|title=Dr. Dre - 2001: Credits|work=Discogs.com}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-2000s, Dr. Dre has taken on a more soulful production style, using more of a classical piano instead of a keyboard, and having [[clapping|claps]] replace snares, as evidenced in songs such as Snoop Dogg's \"Imagine\" and \"[[Boss' Life]]\", [[Busta Rhymes]]' \"Get You Some\" and \"Been Through the Storm\", [[Stat Quo]]'s \"Get Low\" and \"The Way It Be\", Jay-Z's \"[[Lost One]]\", Nas' \"Hustlers\", and several beats on Eminem's Relapse album. Soul and R&B pianist [[Mark Batson]], having previously worked with [[The Dave Matthews Band]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] and [[Maroon 5]] has been credited as the architect of this sound. Besides Batson, Aftermath producer and understudy of Dre's, [[Dawaun Parker]], who has named [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] and [[J Dilla]] as his primary influences, is thought to be responsible for giving Dre's newest beats an East Coast feel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2kmusic.com/fr/topic/interview-de-dawaun-parker/31490|title=Interview de Dawaun Parker|work=2KMUSIC.COM}}</ref>\n\nDespite an occasional hint of trap about the beats and an intriguingly warped use of autotune in his Compton album song, \"Darkside/Gone\", his production seems to stand slightly apart from current trends in hip-hop like Eminem's song \"Little Engine\" with an ominous horrorcore beat \u2014 reminiscent of some of his works on Eminem's album Relapse - or the West Coast joint Lock It Up.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/10/dr-dre-compton-review-alexis-petridis | title=Dr Dre: Compton review \u2013 potent beats by the Dre you forgot about | work=The Guardian | date=August 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://themusic.com.au/news/eminem-music-to-be-murdered-by-review-track-by-track/ILA4MjU0NzY/18-01-20 |title=Is Eminem's New Album Worth The Surprise?

He cites 1970s [[funk]] musicians such as [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]] as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo.<ref name=\"scratch 2004\">{{cite web|title=Dr. Dre Interview|url=http://www.dr-dre.com/info/interview_scratch_dr_dre.php|work=[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]|date=May 2004|access-date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> In 2001 he told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, \"I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it.

In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie ''The Wash'', featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.&nbsp;Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include [[King Tee]], ''2001'' vocalist Hittman, [[Joell Ortiz]], [[Raekwon]] and [[Rakim]].<ref name=\"source 2003\">{{Cite news|title=Before & Aftermath|newspaper=[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]|pages=100\u2013102|issue=168|date=September 2003|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=dresource|access-date=February 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401101228/http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=dresource|archive-date=April 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Collaborators and co-producers===\n[[File:Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.jpg|thumb|Dr. Dre performing with Snoop Dogg, 2012]]\nOver the years, word of other collaborators who have contributed to Dr.&nbsp;Dre's work has surfaced. During his tenure at Death Row Records, it was alleged that Dr.&nbsp;Dre's stepbrother Warren G and [[Tha Dogg Pound]] member [[Daz Dillinger|Daz]] made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album ''The Chronic'' and Snoop Doggy Dogg's album ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (Daz received production credits on Snoop's similar-sounding, albeit less successful album ''Tha Doggfather'' after Young left Death Row Records).<ref name=\"DPG-Eulogy\">Tha Dogg Pound.

In 2006 he told ''Rolling Stone'':\n\n{{blockquote|\"At the time, I saw Dr.&nbsp;Dre desperately needed something,\" Storch says. \"He needed a fuel injection, and Dr.&nbsp;Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide.

In 2004 he claimed to ''Songwriter Universe'' magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song \"[[The Real Slim Shady]]\", stating, \"I initially played a bass line on the song, and Dr.&nbsp;Dre, Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there. [[Eminem]] then heard the track, and he wrote the rap to it.\"<ref name=\"songwriter universe\"/> This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book ''Angry Blonde'', stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr.&nbsp;Dre was out of the studio but Young later programmed the song's beat after returning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eminem|author-link=Eminem|title=Angry Blonde|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmIJ1crh9DwC|year=2000|place=New York City|publisher=[[Regan Books]]|isbn=0-06-620922-6 |page=107}}</ref>\n\nA group of disgruntled former associates of Dr.&nbsp;Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label in the September 2003 issue of ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''.
