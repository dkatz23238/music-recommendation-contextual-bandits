The first, \"Shit on You\", was recorded over the instrumental of [[Shit on You|D12's track of the same name]] and mainly attacked group member [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]]. Following Royce's second track, \"Malcolm X\", D12 responded with \"Smack Down\", over the instrumental of [[50 Cent]]'s \"Back Down\". Proof himself released the tracks \"Many Men\", over the instrumental of 50 Cent's \"Many Men (Wish Death)\"; and \"Beef Is Ova\", with rap group The Purple Gang. Royce responded with his third track, \"Death Day\", recorded over 50 Cent's \"[[In Da Club]]\".\n\nProof confronted Royce outside a Detroit nightclub in 2003, which led to a fight between both rappers' entourages. Proof and Royce were arrested and jailed overnight in adjacent cells, where they talked out their differences and ended the feud.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgPznfn-rek&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL|Royce Royce Da 5'9\" Youtube Interview].

The in-game radio station, [[Game Radio FM]], prominently featured Royce's \"[[I'm the King]]\" and [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]]-produced solo track, which (along with the publicized beef) helped elevate Royce's name beyond his association with Eminem. In 2001, Royce was featured on pop singer [[Willa Ford]]'s song \"[[I Wanna Be Bad]]\". In 2004, he released his second and most critically successful album to date, ''[[Death Is Certain]]'', charting with another Premier-produced single, \"[[Hip-Hop]]\".\n\nAfter the relative success of his second effort, Royce put out a third solo project, ''[[Independent's Day]]'', in 2005. This was met with less acclaim than either of his previous releases. During this time, the rivalry between Royce and former friend Proof reached a boiling point in the streets of Detroit, on an occasion where the two rappers drew guns; they were subsequently arrested and left to work out their differences while spending the night in neighboring cells in jail. The time spent in jail led to the artists ending their feud and subsequently embarking on two overseas tours together.<ref>[http://www.michiganhiphop.com/2008/07/14/the-detroit-reunion-concert-pics-video/ \"The Detroit Reunion Concert (Pics & Video)\", ''MichiganHipHop.com''].
