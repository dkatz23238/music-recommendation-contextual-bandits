This name was inspired by the [[fantasy novel]] ''[[Imajica]]'' (1991) by [[Clive Barker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with The Birthday Massacre By DeathWish|url=http://www.vampirefreaks.com/content/comment.php?entry=315&t=Interview+with+the+Birthday+Massacre|publisher=Vampirefreaks.com|access-date=August 11, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, they changed the name to The Birthday Massacre after one of their earlier songs in order to avoid confusion with another group. The song ''The Birthday Massacre'' was then renamed ''Happy Birthday''. According to their vocalist Chibi: \"it kind of works well for the music that we're making. Sort of contrasty, you know?
