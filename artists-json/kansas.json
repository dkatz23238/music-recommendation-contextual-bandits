Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of [[bison]].\n\nThe first Euro-American settlement in Kansas occurred in 1827 at [[Fort Leavenworth]]. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate. When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], abolitionist [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] from [[New England]] and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a [[Slave states and free states|free state or a slave state]]. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as [[Bleeding Kansas]].

The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]], who explored the area in 1541.\n\nBetween 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into [[Spanish Louisiana]]. The governor [[Luis de Unzaga]] 'le Conciliateur', during that period, promoted expeditions and good relations with the [[Amerindians]], among the explorers were [[Antoine de Marigny]] and others who continued trading across the [[Kansas River]], especially at its confluence with the [[Missouri River]], tributaries of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Cazorla, Frank, G.

Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico, and the [[Republic of Texas]] until the conclusion of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1848, when these lands were [[Mexican Cession|ceded to the United States]]. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from [[Missouri]] and silver and furs from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today.\n\nIn 1827, [[Fort Leavenworth]] became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a211662.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412030430/https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a211662.pdf|url-status=live|archive-date=April 12, 2019|title=A Brief History of Fort Leavenworth|author=Partin, John W.

[[Kansas Territory]] stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day [[Denver]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].\n[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|[[Lawrence Massacre|Quantrill's Raid]] on [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]]]\n\nThe first non-military settlement of Euro-Americans in Kansas Territory consisted of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] from [[Massachusetts]] and other [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] who founded the town of Lawrence and attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri.\n\nMissouri and [[Arkansas]] continually sent settlers into Kansas Territory along its eastern border to sway votes in favor of slavery prior to Kansas statehood elections. Directly presaging the [[American Civil War]] these forces collided, entering into skirmishes and guerrilla conflicts that earned the territory the nickname [[Bleeding Kansas]]. These included [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s [[Pottawatomie massacre]] of 1856.\n\nKansas was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. By that time, the violence in Kansas had largely subsided, but during the Civil War, on August 21, 1863, [[William Quantrill]] led several hundred men on a raid into [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people. He was roundly condemned by both the conventional [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] and the partisan rangers commissioned by the [[Missouri legislature]]. His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre-war criminal record.<ref>Jones, ''Gray Ghosts and Rebel Riders'' Holt & Co. 1956, p. 76</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many [[African Americans]] also looked to Kansas as the land of \"[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]\" and, led by [[freedmen]] like [[Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton]], began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as [[Exodusters]].\n\nAt the same time, the [[Chisholm Trail]] was opened and the [[American Old West|Wild West]]-era commenced in Kansas. [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was a deputy marshal at [[Fort Riley]] and a marshal at [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]] and [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]. [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] was another wild cowboy town, and both [[Bat Masterson]] and [[Wyatt Earp]] worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, eight million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname \"Queen of the Cowtowns\".\n\nIn response to demands of [[Methodists]] and other [[evangelical Protestants]], in 1881 Kansas became the first U.S. state to adopt a constitutional amendment [[Prohibition|prohibiting]] all [[Alcohol laws of Kansas|alcoholic beverages]], which was repealed in 1948.\n\nIn 1922, suffragist [[Ella Uphay Mowry]] became the first female gubernatorial candidate in the state when she ran as \"Mrs. W.D.

A sequence of [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] rocks outcrop in the eastern and southern part of the state. The state's western half has exposures of [[Cretaceous]] through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the [[erosion]] of the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east.

The eastern two-thirds of the state (especially the northeastern portion) has a [[humid continental climate]], with cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation falls during both the summer and the spring.\n\nThe western third of the state\u2014from roughly the [[U.S. Route 83]] corridor westward\u2014has a [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[steppe]] climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold. The western region receives an average of about {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year. [[Chinook wind]]s in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=off}} range.\n\nThe south-central and southeastern portions of the state, including the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] area, have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot and humid summers, milder winters, and more precipitation than elsewhere in Kansas. Some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter.\n\nTemperatures in areas between U.S. Routes 83 and [[U.S. Route 81|81]], as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of [[U.S. Route 50|U.S. 50]], reach {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=}} or above on most days of June, July, and August. High humidity added to the high temperatures sends the [[heat index]] into life-threatening territory, especially in Wichita, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Russell, Kansas|Russell]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], and [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]]. Temperatures are often higher in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature.\n\nAlthough temperatures of {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} or higher are not as common in areas east of U.S. 81, higher humidity and the [[urban heat island]] effect lead most summer days to heat indices between {{convert|107|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and {{convert|114|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], and the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]]. Also, combined with humidity between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat indices can be experienced at every hour of the day.\n\nPrecipitation ranges from about {{convert|47|in|mm}} annually in the state's southeast corner to about {{convert|16|in|mm}} in the southwest. Snowfall ranges from around {{convert|5|in|mm}} in the fringes of the south, to {{convert|35|in|mm}} in the far northwest. Frost-free days range from more than 200 days in the south, to 130 days in the northwest. Thus, Kansas is the country's ninth or tenth sunniest state, depending on the source. Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].\n\nKansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer. Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Some of these storms become [[supercell]] thunderstorms; these can produce some [[tornado]]es, occasionally those of [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF3]] strength or higher. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually.<ref name=\"Annual Average Number of Tornadoes\">{{cite web |title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953\u20132004 |url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] |access-date = October 25, 2006 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date = October 16, 2011}}</ref> Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop some very large [[hail]] over Kansas as well. Furthermore, these storms can even bring in flash flooding and damaging straight line winds.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the all-time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is ({{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}) on July 24, 1936, near [[Alton, Kansas|Alton]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]], and the all-time low is {{convert|-40|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on February 13, 1905, near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]] in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]].

Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including [[Spirit AeroSystems]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[LearJet]]), and [[Textron Aviation]] (a merger of the former [[Cessna]], [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]], and [[Beechcraft]] brands). [[Boeing]] ended a decades-long history of manufacturing in Kansas between 2012 and 2013.\n\nMajor companies headquartered in Kansas include the [[Garmin]] ([[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]]), [[YRC Worldwide]] (Overland Park), [[Payless Shoes]] (national headquarters and major distribution facilities in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]), and [[Koch Industries]] (with national headquarters in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]), and [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] (headquarters in Wichita).\n\nKansas is also home to three major military installations: [[Fort Leavenworth]] (Army), [[Fort Riley]] (Army), and [[McConnell Air Force Base]] (Air Force). Approximately 25,000 active duty soldiers and airmen are stationed at these bases which also employ approximately 8,000 civilian DoD employees. The US Army Reserve also has the 451st Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Wichita that serves reservists and their units from around the region. The Kansas Air National Guard has units at [[Forbes Field]] in Topeka and the 184th Intelligence Wing in Wichita. The Smoky Hill Weapons Range, a detachment of the Intelligence Wing, is one of the largest and busiest bombing ranges in the nation. During World War II, Kansas was home to numerous Army Air Corps training fields for training new pilots and aircrew. Many of those airfields live on today as municipal airports.\n\n===Energy===\nKansas has vast renewable resources and is a top producer of [[Wind power in Kansas|wind energy]] in the US, with an installed capacity of about 6,100&nbsp;[[Megawatts]]&nbsp;(MW) from nearly 3,200 wind turbines in 2019. Wind generated the [[List of power stations in Kansas|largest share of electricity]] from the state at 41%. An additional 700&nbsp;MW of capacity was scheduled to come online during 2020. Kansas is also a leading national producer of renewable [[ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] fuels at nearly 600&nbsp;million gallons per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=KS |title=Kansas State Energy Profile Analysis |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=April 1, 2021}}</ref>\n\nKansas is ranked eighth in [[Petroleum in the United States|US petroleum extraction]]. Production has experienced a steady decline as the state's limited economical reserves especially from the [[Anadarko Basin]] are depleted. Since [[Price of oil|oil prices]] bottomed in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant, with an average monthly rate of about {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 2004. The [[Oil price increases since 2003|recent higher prices]] have made [[carbon sequestration|carbon dioxide sequestration]] and other oil recovery techniques more economical.\n\nKansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. Production has steadily declined since the mid-1990s with the gradual depletion of the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton Natural Gas Field]]\u2014the state's largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased [[coalbed methane]] production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over {{convert|32|e9cuft|km3|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\n===Taxes===\n{{Main|Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117}}\n\nTax is collected by the [[Kansas Department of Revenue]].\n\nRevenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction have contributed to the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16&nbsp;billion in 1998 to $3.83&nbsp;billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Kansas had three income brackets for income tax calculation, ranging from 3.5% to 6.45%.\n\nThe state sales tax in Kansas is 6.15%. Various cities and counties in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 [[recession]] (March\u2013November 2001), when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. If there had been no change in sales tax rates or in the economy, the total sales tax collections for 2003 would have been $1,797&nbsp;million, compared to $805.3&nbsp;million in 1990. However, they instead amounted to $1,630&nbsp;million an inflation-adjusted reduction of 10%. The state sales tax is a combined destination-based tax, meaning a single tax is applied that includes state, county, and local taxes, and the rate is based on where the consumer takes possession of the goods or services. Thanks to the destination structure and the numerous local special taxing districts, Kansas has 920 separate sales tax rates ranging from 6.5% to 11.5%.<ref>{{cite web |title = Publication 1700 |url = https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |website = Kansas Department of Revenue |access-date = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405025326/https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |archive-date = April 5, 2018}}</ref> This taxing scheme, known as \"[[Streamlined Sales Tax]]\" was adopted on October 1, 2005, under the governorship of [[Kathleen Sebelius]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Streamlined Sales Tax\u2014Kansas |url = http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |website = Streamlined Sales Tax |access-date = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405090353/http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |archive-date = April 5, 2018}}</ref> Groceries are subject to sales tax in the state. All sales tax collected is remitted to the state department of revenue, and local taxes are then distributed to the various taxing agencies.\n\nAs of June 2004, [[Moody's Investors Service]] ranked the state 14th for net tax-supported debt per capita. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%\u2014above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. The state has a statutory requirement to maintain cash reserves of at least 7.5% of expenses at the end of each fiscal year; however, lawmakers can vote to override the rule, and did so during the most recent budget agreement.\n\nDuring his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor [[Sam Brownback]] called for a complete \"phase out of Kansas's income tax\".<ref name=\"theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017\"/> In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the '''Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117'''.<ref name=\"HB2117\">{{cite web |title = Senate Substitute for HB 2117 by Committee on Taxation\u2014Reduction of income tax rates for individuals and determination of income tax credits; severance tax exemptions; homestead property tax refunds; food sales tax refunds |url = http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |access-date = October 29, 2014 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141030002120/http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |archive-date = October 30, 2014}}</ref> Starting in 2013, the \"ambitious tax overhaul\" trimmed income tax, eliminated some corporate taxes, and created [[Flow-through entity|pass-through income]] tax exemptions, he raised the sales tax by one percent to offset the loss to state revenues but that was inadequate.

However, Topeka was unable to support the team, and it disbanded after one year.\n\nThe first night game in the history of professional baseball was played in Independence on April 28, 1930, when the Muscogee (Oklahoma) Indians beat the Independence Producers 13\u20133 in a minor league game sanctioned by the Western League of the Western Baseball Association with 1,500 fans attending the game. The permanent lighting system was first used for an exhibition game on April 17, 1930, between the Independence Producers and House of David semi-professional baseball team of Benton Harbor, Michigan with the Independence team winning 9\u20131 before a crowd of 1,700 spectators.<ref>Bowman, Larry G. \"I Think It Is Pretty Ritzy Myself: Kansas Minor League Teams and Night Baseball\".

The teams are rivals in the [[Big 12 Conference]].\n\nBoth KU and K-State have tradition-rich programs in men's basketball. The Jayhawks are a perennial national power, ranking first in all-time victories among NCAA programs. The Jayhawks have won six national titles, including NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, 2008, and 2022. They also were retroactively awarded national championships by the [[Helms Foundation]] for 1922 and 1923. K-State also had a long stretch of success on the hardwood, lasting from the 1940s to the 1980s, making four [[Final Four]]s during that stretch. In 1988, KU and K-State met in the [[Elite Eight]], KU taking the game 71\u201358. After a 12-year absence, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008, and advanced to the Elite Eight in 2010 and 2018. KU is fifth all-time with 15 Final Four appearances, while K-State's four appearances are tied for 17th.\n\nConversely, success on the [[American football|gridiron]] has been less frequent for both KSU and KU. However, there have been recent breakthroughs for both schools' football teams. The Jayhawks won the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for the first time in three tries in 2008, capping a 12\u20131 season, the best in school history. And when [[Bill Snyder]] arrived to coach at K-State in 1989, he turned the Wildcats from one of the worst college football programs in America,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Looney |first=Douglas |title=Futility U |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=September 4, 1989 |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/09/04/120464/futility-u-kansas-state-winless-since-1986-has-one-claim-to-fame-it-is-americas-most-hapless-team}}</ref> into a national force for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. The team won the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in 1997, achieved an undefeated (11\u20130) regular season and No.{{nbsp}}1 ranking in 1998, and took the [[Big 12 Conference]] championship in 2003. After three seasons in which K-State football languished, Snyder came out of retirement in 2009 and guided them to the top of the college football ranks again, finishing second in the Big 12 in 2011 and earning a berth in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], and winning the Big 12 again in 2012.\n\n[[Wichita State University]], which also fields teams (called the [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]]) in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], is best known for its baseball and basketball programs. In baseball, the Shockers won the [[College World Series]] in 1989. In men's basketball, they appeared in the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, and entered the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The school also fielded a [[American football|football]] team from 1897 to 1986. The Shocker football team is tragically known for a [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|plane crash]] in 1970 that killed 31 people, including 14 players.\n\n=====NCAA Division II schools=====\n\nNotable success has also been achieved by the state's smaller schools in football. [[Pittsburg State University]], an NCAA Division II participant, has claimed four national titles in football, two in the NAIA and most recently the 2011 NCAA Division II national title. Pittsburg State became the winningest NCAA Division II football program in 1995. PSU passed Hillsdale College at the top of the all-time victories list in the 1995 season on its march to the national runner-up finish. The Gorillas, in 96 seasons of intercollegiate competition, have accumulated 579 victories, posting a 579\u2013301\u201348 overall mark.\n\n[[Washburn University]], in Topeka, won the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Men's Basketball Championship in 1987. The [[Fort Hays State University]] men won the 1996 NCAA Division II title with a 34\u20130 record, and the Washburn women won the 2005 NCAA Division II crown. St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, won the 1954 and 1967 Men's NAIA Basketball Championships.\n\nThe [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] has its roots as one of the oldest college sport conferences in existence and participates in the NAIA and all ten member schools are in the state of Kansas. Other smaller school conferences that have some members in Kansas are the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association]] the [[Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference]], the [[Midwest Christian College Conference]], and the [[Heart of America Athletic Conference]]. Many [[junior college]]s also have active athletic programs.\n\n[[Emporia State]]'s women's basketball team, under head coach [[Brandon Schneider]], who is now serving as the women's basketball coach at the University of Kansas, has seen success as well. In 2010 the team won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Emporia State and Washburn in Topeka share a heated rivalry in all sports, mostly due to the close proximity of both cities.\n\n=====Junior colleges=====\n\nThe [[Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference]] has been heralded as one of the best conferences in all of [[NJCAA]] football, with [[Garden City Community College]], [[Independence Community College]], and [[Butler County Community College]] all consistently in contention for national championships.\n\n====High school====\n\nThe [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] (KSHSAA) is the organization which oversees interscholastic competition in the state of Kansas at the high school level. It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities. The association is perhaps best known for devising the overtime system now used for almost all football games below the professional level (which has also been adopted at all levels of [[Canadian football]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Kansas|United States}}\n* [[Index of Kansas-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Kansas]]\n* [[List of Kansas landmarks]]\n* [[List of people from Kansas]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Kansas]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n<!--Note: the section name \"Bibliography\" is linked from other articles, posted in April 2018 by User:Sbmeirow-->\n{{See also|History of Kansas#Bibliography|l1=Longer list of books about the history of Kansas}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1911 to 1925 |date=1956 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212250/ }}; 559 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1886 to 1910 |date=1954 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212249/ }}; 535 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Wilder |first1=Daniel W. |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1541 to 1885 |date=1886 |publisher=Kansas Publishing House |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223666}}; 1204 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Connelley |editor-first=William E. |title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans |publisher=Lewis Publishing Company |year=1918 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1918ks/toc.html }}; 5 volumes; 2731 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo00conn/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo02conn/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo03conn/ Vol3]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo04conn/ Vol4]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo05conn/ Vol5]); the 1919 edition contains additional biographies.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Connelley |first1=William E. |title=History of Kansas Newspapers: A History of the Newspapers and Magazines Published in Kansas from 1854 to 1916 |date=1916 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/211020/ }}; 369 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Blackmar |editor-first=Frank W. |title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc |publisher = Standard Publishing Co |year=1912 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1912/ }}; 3 volumes; 2723 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyc01blac/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascycloped02blac/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyclopedia03blac/ Vol3])\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Everts |editor-first=Louis H. |title=Official State Atlas of Kansas |publisher=L.H.
