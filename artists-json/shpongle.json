The group includes [[Hallucinogen (musician)|Hallucinogen]] and [[Raja Ram (musician)|Raja Ram]] (one of three in [[The Infinity Project]]). The duo are considered to be one of the [[progenitor]]s of the [[psybient]] genre - a genre combining [[world music]] with [[psychedelic trance]] and [[ambient music|ambient]]. Their musical style combines [[traditional music]] from all over the world and vocals with contemporary western [[synthesizer]]-based psychedelic music. When asked to describe Shpongle's music, Posford has responded that it is \"like nothing you've ever heard before.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/therealshpongle |title=SHPONGLE &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2014-07-25}}</ref>\n\nShpongle's first track, \"Vapour Rumours\", was released on TIP Records' ''Infinite Excursions'' compilation in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/48877 |title=Various - Infinite Excursions - Softer Psychedelic Sounds (CD) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2014-07-25}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Are You Shpongled?]]'', was released in 1998 on [[Twisted Records (UK)|Twisted Records]]. On 9 September 2014, Posford confirmed beginning work on a sixth album, which was released as ''Codex VI'' on October 23rd 2017. On 3 October, even before the release of ''Codex VI'', the duo announced via a Facebook video that they have begun working on their seventh studio album. \nSince June 30th, the duo have also been releasing remasters of their previous albums, focussing on releasing special edition vinyl records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shponglemusic.bandcamp.com/album/are-you-shpongled-remastered|title=Are You Shpongled?

For example, the track \"A New Way to Say 'Hooray'\", contains a vocal sample of [[Terence McKenna]] describing the effects of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].\n\n==Shpongle live==\nShpongle has played several live concerts, and Simon Posford tours frequently, performing live DJ sets.
