He is known for his atmospheric instrumental production which incorporates sound elements from nature and extensive use of jazz and soul samples.\n\n==Early life==\nIshi was born in [[Tokyo]] in 1962. He dropped out of school at an early age and joined a local gang and, a few years later, the [[yakuza]]. Early in his career as a yakuza underling, Ishi discovered [[Yubitsume|a severed finger]] wrapped in paper on his desk. Later, after discovering that it had belonged to a friend, he decided to leave the yakuza and cut ties with the criminal underworld.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fuller |first=Thomas |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/01/18/kruser_ed3_.php |title=DJ Krush Gives the Turntable an Asian Spin - NYTimes.com |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=2002-01-18 |access-date=2012-05-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225205731/http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/01/18/kruser_ed3_.php |archive-date=February 25, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=kronick>{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Jeff|title=DJ Krush: Kracking the Code|url=http://www.kronick.com/2.0/issue27/djkrush.shtml|access-date=15 August 2014}}</ref> Ishi was inspired to start DJing after seeing the film ''[[Wild Style]]'' in 1983.<ref name=kronick/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Song |first1=Berwin |title=DJ Krush interview |url=http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/features/Bars__Clubs-Nightlife_features/5019/DJ-Krush-interview.html |website=Time Out Shanghai |access-date=15 August 2014 |date=21 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082656/http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/features/Bars__Clubs-Nightlife_features/5019/DJ-Krush-interview.html |archive-date=19 August 2014 }}</ref> \"When I discovered the film Wild Style in 1983 I found what I really wanted to do, to express myself,\" he said in a 2015 interview. \"Breaking, grafitti, rap, DJ\u2026 I always liked music so I chose DJ.

Upon entering the industry, Ishi, with his experimental beats and instrumental sounds, changed the face of hip-hop at a time when it was dominated by the American rap scene. He is reluctant to identify his music with any particular genre, for it would place limits on his listeners and on his talents.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Manabe, Noriko|title=\"Representing Japan: \u2018national\u2019 style among Japanese hip-hop DJs\"|journal=Popular Music|volume=32|pages=35-50|doi=10.1017/S0261143012000530|url=https://www.academia.edu/2527373/Representing_Japan_national_style_among_Japanese_hip-hop_DJs}}</ref> He has been regarded as [[ambient music|ambient]], [[trip hop]], some combination of the two, and hip hop.
