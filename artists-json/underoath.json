Originally, the band identified as a [[Christian music|Christian]] group; they have since distanced themselves from Christianity.<sup>([[Underoath#Christianity|see below]])</sup>\n\nThe band's lineup shifted frequently during its early years. Taylor recorded ''[[Act of Depression]]'', ''[[Cries of the Past]]'', and ''[[The Changing of Times]]'' with the band and remained with the group until his departure in 2003; Chamberlain replaced him as lead vocalist, and the lineup has remained mostly stable since. The band then released ''[[They're Only Chasing Safety]]'' and ''[[Define the Great Line]]'', and both earned gold certifications by the [[RIAA]].
