After being embraced by local [[college radio]] and punk scenes (including such venues as [[CBGB]]), the Goo Goo Dolls incorporated elements of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[pop rock]], and [[punk rock]] into the album.

The single \"We Are the Normal\" received a major push toward play on college and independent radio, and its video was displayed on MTV's [[120 Minutes]] program. \"Fallin' Down\" made it onto the 1993 soundtrack of [[Pauly Shore]]'s hit film ''[[Son in Law]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\n== Mainstream success (1993\u20132010) ==\n=== ''A Boy Named Goo'', legal issues, and Tutuska's departure (1993\u20131997) ===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2020}} \nJust before ''A Boy Named Goo'''s release, Tutuska was fired from the band and replaced by [[Mike Malinin]].<ref name=\"iwarp1\"/> Prior to Tutuska's departure, there was a payment dispute between him and Rzeznik over Tutuska's contribution to the writing of the ''[[Superstar Car Wash]]'' single \"Fallin' Down\".

''A Boy Named Goo'' became the first album in [[Metal Blade Records|Metal Blade]] history to achieve double-platinum status. This success, however, proved bittersweet, as the band found themselves in a legal battle with Metal Blade records.
