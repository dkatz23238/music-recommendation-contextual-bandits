A Perfect Circle has released four studio albums, the first three during the early 2000s:  ''[[Mer de Noms]]'', their debut album in 2000, and followed up by ''[[Thirteenth Step]]'' in 2003; then in 2004, ''[[Emotive (album)|Emotive]]''\u2014an album of radically re-worked [[cover songs]]. Shortly after ''Emotive''{{'}}s release, the band went on hiatus; Keenan returned to Tool and started up solo work under the band name [[Puscifer]], while Howerdel released a solo album, ''[[Keep Telling Myself It's Alright]]'', under the moniker [[Ashes Divide]]. Band activity was sporadic in the following years; the band reformed in 2010, and played live shows on and off between 2010 and 2013, but fell into inactivity after the release of their [[greatest hits]] album, ''[[Three Sixty]]'', and a [[live album]] [[box set]], ''[[A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo]]'' in late 2013. The band reformed in 2017 to record a fourth album, ''[[Eat the Elephant]]'', which was released on April 20, 2018.\n\nProne to downtime due to Keenan's other musical commitments, the band has featured a variety of musicians throughout alternating periods of activity and inactivity, and has changed line-ups on each album, leaving Keenan and Howerdel the only constant members. The original incarnation of the band included [[Paz Lenchantin]] on bass, [[Troy Van Leeuwen]] on guitar, and [[Josh Freese]] on drums. [[Primus (band)|Primus]] drummer [[Tim Alexander]] had briefly stood in as a drummer prior to Freese in the band's initial live shows; however, this was prior to releasing any material. Band collaborator and producer [[Danny Lohner]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] bassist [[Jeordie White]] were also members for a short period in the early 2000s. The band's current lineup features [[Smashing Pumpkins]] guitarist [[James Iha]], bassist [[Matt McJunkins]], and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer and Ashes Divide projects. Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, the stylistic content of [[List of songs recorded by A Perfect Circle|A Perfect Circle's songs]] has remained consistent with Howerdel as music composer, and Keenan writing lyrics and vocal melodies. The band's studio albums have been generally well received critically and commercially, with their first three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005.<ref name=\"altpress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/a_perfect_circle_return_from_hiatus_announce_fall_tour|title=A Perfect Circle return from hiatus, announce fall tour \u2013 News \u2013 Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|access-date=October 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013225046/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/a_perfect_circle_return_from_hiatus_announce_fall_tour|archive-date=October 13, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''Mer de Noms'' (1999\u20132000)===\n[[File:A Perfect Circle Logo 2011 - Michael John Stinsman InvisibleStudio Productions.png|thumb|200px|A Perfect Circle logo]]\n\nA Perfect Circle was originally conceived by [[Billy Howerdel]], a former [[guitar technician]] for [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Fishbone]] and [[Tool (band)|Tool]].<ref name=\"MTVorigins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1433137/tools-maynard-prepares-a-perfect-circle-debut/|title=Tool's Maynard Prepares A Perfect Circle Debut|website=Mtv.com|access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref> Howerdel met singer [[Maynard James Keenan]] in 1992, when Tool was opening for Fishbone, and the two became friends.<ref name=\"AllMBio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/a-perfect-circle-mn0000479149/biography|title=A Perfect Circle \u2013 Biography & History \u2013 AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref> Three years later, Keenan offered Howerdel, who was looking for lodging, a room in his [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|North Hollywood]] home.
