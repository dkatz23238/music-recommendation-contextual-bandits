The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, [[blues]]y sound and deep-voiced frontman [[Eric Burdon]], as exemplified by their [[signature song]] and transatlantic number-one hit single \"[[The House of the Rising Sun#The Animals' version|The House of the Rising Sun]]\" as well as by hits such as  \"[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]\", \"[[It's My Life (The Animals song)|It's My Life]]\", \"[[Don't Bring Me Down (The Animals song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\", \"[[I'm Crying]]\", \"[[See See Rider]]\" and \"[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood#The Animals version|Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]].\" The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm-and-blues-oriented album material and were part of the [[British Invasion]] of the US.\n\nThe Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s, and suffered from poor business management, leading the original incarnation to split up in 1966. Burdon assembled a mostly new lineup of musicians under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals; the much-changed act moved to California and achieved commercial success as a [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[hard rock]] band with hits such as \"[[San Franciscan Nights]]\", \"[[When I Was Young (song)|When I Was Young]]\" and \"[[Sky Pilot (song)|Sky Pilot]]\" before disbanding at the end of the decade.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-animals/biography |title=The Animals Biography|magazine=Rolling Stone|year=2001 |access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Altogether, the group had 10 top-20 hits in both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nThe original lineup of Burdon, [[Alan Price]], [[Chas Chandler]], [[Hilton Valentine]] and [[John Steel (drummer)|John Steel]] reunited for a one-off benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968. They later launched brief comebacks in 1975 and 1983. Several partial regroupings of the original-era members have occurred since then under various names.

They were transported from the airport into Manhattan in a motorcade, chased by shrieking young female fans, consisting of [[Sunbeam Alpine]] Series IV top-down convertibles with fashion models riding along. The Animals sang \"[[I'm Crying]]\" and \"The House of the Rising Sun\" to a packed audience of hysterical girls screaming throughout both performances on Sullivan's show. In December, the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] film ''[[Get Yourself a College Girl]]'' was released, featuring the Animals and [[the Dave Clark Five]].

The Animals Big Band made their one public appearance on 5 August 1965.

As 1965 ended, the group signed a new deal with their American label [[MGM Records]] for the US and Canada and switched to [[Decca Records]] for the rest of the world. They also ended their association with Most and began to work with MGM Records producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], who allowed them more artistic freedom.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=%22animals+to+switch+to+MGM%22&hl=en&ei=_rpGTsu-CY3HsQKykO32BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22animals%20to%20switch%20to%20MGM%22&f=false Animals to Switch to MGM] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' (25 Sep 1965).

''Eric Is Here'' was Burdon's final release for Decca Records.\n\nBy this time, the Animals' business affairs \"were in a total shambles\" according to Chandler (who went on to manage [[Jimi Hendrix]] and produce [[Slade]]) and the group disbanded.

Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time that were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed with Price and a complete lineup, foreshadowing future events.\n\nAll five original band members reunited in 1983 for the album ''[[Ark (Animals album)|Ark]]'' and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, [[Nippy Noya]] on percussion, [[Steve Gregory]] on saxophone and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single, \"[[The Night (Animals song)|The Night]],\" reached number 48 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The band released a second single called \"Love Is for All Time,\" which did not chart.\n\nSongs performed on the ''Ark'' tour included some from the 1960s, but most were from the band's contemporary repertoire, such as \"Heart Attack\", \"No More Elmore\" (both released a year earlier by Burdon), \"Oh Lucky Man\" (from the 1973 soundtrack album to ''O Lucky Man!'' by Price), \"It's Too Late\", \"Tango\" and \"Young Girls\" (later released on Burdon's compilation album ''The Night''). Their [[Wembley Arena]] concert on 31 December 1983 (supporting the Police) was released on the ''[[Greatest Hits Live (Rip It to Shreds)|Rip it To Shreds]]'' live album in 1984 after the Animals had disbanded again. Their 29 November 1983 concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]] was released on 27 February 2008 as ''Last Live Show''.

Other members of this version of the band include Steve Hutchinson, [[Steve Dawson]] and Martin Bland. From 1999 until Valentine's departure in 2001, the band toured as the Animals. This version featured Tony Liddle on lead vocals backed by Valentine, Steel, Rowberry and [[Jim Rodford]]. Chris Allen substituted for Rodford, who was busy with [[Argent (band)|Argent]], on bass and backing vocals. Steve Farrell contributed backing vocals and hand percussion.\n*After Valentine left these Animals in 2001, Steel and Rowberry continued as Animals and Friends with Peter Barton, Rodford, and John E. Williamson. When Rowberry died in 2003, he was replaced by Mick Gallagher (who had briefly replaced Price in 1965). Danny Handley joined the band in 2009, initially as lead guitarist, but replaced Barton on lead vocals when Barton retired in 2012. Scott Whitley had a brief tenure in the band before Roberto \"Bobby\" Ruiz took over on bass. This successful lineup continues to tour the world with guests such as [[Steve Cropper]] and [[Spencer Davis]].\n*Burdon formed a new backing band in 1998 that was billed as Eric Burdon and the New Animals. This was actually just a renaming of an existing band with whom he had been touring in various forms since 1990. Members of this new group included Dean Restum, [[Dave Meros]], [[Neal Morse]] and [[Aynsley Dunbar]]. [[Martin Gerschwitz]] replaced Morse in 1999 after [[Ryo Okumoto]]'s brief three-week stint, and Dunbar was replaced by [[Bernie Pershey]] in 2001. In 2003, the band started touring as Eric Burdon and the Animals. After the lineup changed in 2006, original guitarist Valentine joined the group for its 2007 and 2008 tours. The group also included [[Red Young]], Paula O'Rourke and Tony Braunagle. After Burdon lost the rights to the name, he formed a new band with different musicians.\n*In 2016, Burdon formed the current lineup of the Animals, including Johnzo West (guitar/vocals), Davey Allen (keys/vocals), Dustin Koester (drums/vocals), Justin Andres (bass guitar/vocals), Ruben Salinas (sax/flute) and Evan Mackey (trombone).<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Burdon|url=http://www.ericburdon.com/#!band-1/n26of|website=Ericburdon.com|access-date=19 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Dispute over ownership of band name===\nIn 2008, an adjudicator determined that original Animals drummer John Steel owned \"the Animals\" name in the UK because of a trademark registration that Steel had filed. Eric Burdon had objected to the trademark registration, arguing that he personally embodied any goodwill associated with \"the Animals\" name. Burdon's argument was rejected, in part because he had billed himself as \"Eric Burdon and the Animals\" as early as 1967, thus separating the goodwill associated with his own name from that of the band.
