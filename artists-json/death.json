Additionally, the advent of life-sustaining therapy and the numerous criteria for defining death from both a medical and legal standpoint, have made it difficult to create a single unifying definition.\n\nOne of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |author-link=Robin Marantz Henig |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=April 2016 |access-date=23 October 2017 |archive-date=1 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071129/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Such determination, therefore, requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life.\n\nIt is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, an organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms that are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers. Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness. In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.<ref>{{cite book|year=1991 |last1=Metcalf |first1=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\nOther definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of organismic functioning and a human death which refers to irreversible loss of personhood. More specifically, death occurs when a living entity experiences irreversible cessation of all functioning.<ref name=\":0\" /> As it pertains to human life, death is an irreversible process where someone loses their existence as a person.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=DeGrazia|first=David|title=The Definition of Death|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/death-definition/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-02-19|archive-date=18 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318071254/https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/death-definition/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. This type of death where circulatory and respiratory arrest happens is known as the circulatory definition of death (DCDD). Proponents of the DCDD believe that this definition is reasonable because a person with permanent loss of circulatory and respiratory function should be considered dead.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal|last=Bernat|first=James L.|date=2018|title=Conceptual Issues in DCDD Donor Death Determination|journal=Hastings Center Report|volume=48|issue=S4|pages=S26\u2013S28|doi=10.1002/hast.948|pmid=30584853|issn=1552-146X|doi-access=free}}</ref> Critics of this definition state that while cessation of these functions may be permanent, it does not mean the situation is irreversible, because if CPR was applied, the person could be revived.<ref name=\":4\"/> Thus, the arguments for and against the DCDD boil down to a matter of defining the actual words \"permanent\" and \"irreversible,\" which further complicates the challenge of defining death. Furthermore, events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.\n\nToday, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to \"brain death\" or \"biological death\" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.\n\nThe category of \"brain death\" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: \"By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant \"brain-dead\" women).\"<ref name=Miller>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=F.G.|title=Death and organ donation: back to the future|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616\u2013620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nWhile \"brain death\" is viewed as problematic by some scholars, there are certainly proponents of it that believe this definition of death is the most reasonable for distinguishing life from death. The reasoning behind the support for this definition is that brain death has a set of criteria that is reliable and reproducible.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Magnus|first1=David C.|last2=Wilfond|first2=Benjamin S.|last3=Caplan|first3=Arthur L.|date=2014-03-06|title=Accepting Brain Death|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=10|pages=891\u2013894|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1400930|issn=0028-4793|pmid=24499177}}</ref> Also, the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings. The distinction should be made that \"brain death\" cannot be equated with one who is in a vegetative state or coma, in that the former situation describes a state that is beyond recovery.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThose people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&nbsp;\u2013 irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&nbsp;\u2013 has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].\n\nEven by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.\n\nIn the past, adoption of this whole-brain definition was a conclusion of the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1980.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Ariane|last2=Cahn-Fuller|first2=Katherine|last3=Caplan|first3=Arthur|date=March 2017|title=Shouldn't Dead Be Dead?: The Search for a Uniform Definition of Death|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=45|issue=1|pages=112\u2013128|doi=10.1177/1073110517703105|pmid=28661278|s2cid=4388540|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> They concluded that this approach to defining death sufficed in reaching a uniform definition nationwide. A multitude of reasons were presented to support this definition including: uniformity of standards in law for establishing death; consumption of a family's fiscal resources for artificial life support; and legal establishment for equating brain death with death in order to proceed with organ donation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sarbey|first=Ben|date=2016-12-01|title=Definitions of death: brain death and what matters in a person|journal=Journal of Law and the Biosciences|volume=3|issue=3|pages=743\u2013752|doi=10.1093/jlb/lsw054|pmid=28852554|pmc=5570697}}</ref>\n\nAside from the issue of support of or dispute against brain death, there is another inherent problem in this categorical definition: the variability of its application in medical practice. In 1995, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), established a set of criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death. At that time, three clinical features had to be satisfied in order to determine \"irreversible cessation\" of the total brain including: coma with clear etiology, cessation of breathing, and lack of brainstem reflexes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Bernat|first=James L.|date=March 2013|title=Controversies in defining and determining death in critical care|journal=Nature Reviews Neurology|volume=9|issue=3|pages=164\u2013173|doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2013.12|pmid=23419370|s2cid=12296259|issn=1759-4766}}</ref> This set of criteria was then updated again most recently in 2010, but substantial discrepancies still remain across hospitals and medical specialties.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe problem of defining death is especially imperative as it pertains to the [[dead donor rule]], which could be understood as one of the following interpretations of the rule: there must be an official declaration of death in a person before starting organ procurement or that organ procurement cannot result in death of the donor.<ref name=\":4\"/> A great deal of controversy has surrounded the definition of death and the dead donor rule. Advocates of the rule believe the rule is legitimate in protecting organ donors while also countering against any moral or legal objection to organ procurement. Critics, on the other hand, believe that the rule does not uphold the best interests of the donors and that the rule does not effectively promote organ donation.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Signs===\n{{main|Stages of death}}\nSigns of death or strong indications that a [[endotherm|warm-blooded animal]] is no longer alive are:\n* [[Respiratory arrest]] (no [[breathing]])\n* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])\n* [[Brain death]] (no neuronal activity)\n[[File:Postmortem interval changes (stages of death).png|thumb|500px|Timeline of postmortem changes (stages of death).]]\nThe stages that follow after death are:\n* {{lang|la|[[Pallor mortis]]}}, paleness which happens in 15\u2013120 minutes after death\n* {{lang|la|[[Algor mortis]]}}, the reduction in body temperature following death.

It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].\n\nAutopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.\n\nA necropsy, which is not always a medical procedure, was a term previously used to describe an unregulated postmortem examination. In modern times, this term is more commonly associated with the corpses of animals.\n\n== Senescence ==\n{{main|Senescence}}\n[[File:Kameldornbaum Sossusvlei.jpg|thumb|Dead [[Vachellia erioloba|Camelthorn tree]] within [[Sossusvlei]]]]\nSenescence refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily.<ref>Hayflick & Moody, 2003</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nAlmost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as \"senescence\".

Despite the fact that aging is by far the most common cause of death worldwide, it is socially mostly ignored as such and seen as \"necessary\" and \"inevitable\" anyway, which is why little money is spent on research into anti-aging therapies, a phenomenon known as the [[pro-aging trance]].<ref name=\"doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011\" />\n\nAverage lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.\n\nA United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918232422/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archive-date=18 September 2016 |access-date=19 September 2016 }}</ref> 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.\n\nResearchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as \"biomedical [[gerontologist]]s\".

Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called \"life extensionists\" or \"longevists\".

The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'' (originally the [[Latin]] ''requiescat in pace''), or its [[initialism]] RIP.\n\nDeath is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mullin|1998|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref> [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].\n\nLegal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.\n\n[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]\n[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/|title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I|publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004030535/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/|archive-date=4 October 2006|access-date=20 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nDeath in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of ''[[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]]'', [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.\n\n[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|''All is Vanity'' by [[Charles Allan Gilbert]] is an example of a ''[[memento mori]]'', intended to represent how life and death are intertwined]]\n\nSuicide in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In Japan, for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] god [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].\n\n[[File:Muerte-Blanca 6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Santa Muerte]], the personification of death in Mexican tradition<ref>{{cite book|last=Chesnut|first=R.

Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cart\u00f3rio. Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nations|first1=Marilyn K.|last2=Amaral|first2=Mara Lucia|title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|date=September 1999|volume=5|issue=3|pages=204\u2013220|doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}</ref>\n\nTalking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open-air burning-to-ashes of the same.\n\n== Consciousness ==\n{{Main|Consciousness after death}}\nMuch interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''. Neither are likely to ever be confirmed without the ponderer having to actually die.\n\n== In biology ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2021}}\n[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are soil-dwelling detritivores]]\nAfter death, the remains of a former organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]], during which animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Falkowski |first=Paul G. |title=Biogeochemical Cycles |date=2001-01-01 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268652000328 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Biodiversity |pages=437\u2013453 |editor-last=Levin |editor-first=Simon Asher |place=New York |publisher=Elsevier |language=en |doi=10.1016/b0-12-226865-2/00032-8 |isbn=978-0-12-226865-6 |access-date=2022-08-23}}</ref> [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of an organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.\n\n[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be fully decomposed. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.\n\n=== Natural selection ===\n{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}\nContemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gregory |first=T.

Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.\n\n=== Extinction ===\n{{Main|Extinction}}\n[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |author-link=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W.

The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly \"reappear\" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] \u2013 and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.\n\n=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===\n{{Main|Evolution of ageing}}\nInquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.\n\nOrganisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are \"immortal\" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident.

Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|\"deathless\"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment. Therefore, death helps remind oneself that one should not take life for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.<ref name=\"Blum 2004\">{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-date=29 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629160542/http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDeath is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|dependent origination]].<ref name=\"Blum 2004\" />\n\n=== Christianity ===\n{{See also|Soul in the Bible|Second death|Resurrection of the dead#Christianity}}While there are different sects of Christianity with different branches of belief; the overarching ideology on death grows from the knowledge of afterlife.

The soul exits this body when the body can no longer sustain the conscious self (life), which may be due to mental or physical reasons, or more accurately, the inability to act on one's ''[[Kama#In Hinduism|kama]]'' (material desires). During conception, the soul enters a compatible new body based on the remaining merits and demerits of one's ''[[Karma#In Hinduism|karma]]'' (good/bad material activities based on ''[[Dharma#Hinduism|dharma]]'') and the state of one's mind (impressions or last thoughts) at the time of death.\n\nUsually the process of [[Reincarnation#Hinduism|reincarnation]] (soul's transmigration) makes one forget all memories of one's previous life. Because nothing really dies and the temporary material body is always changing, both in this life and the next, death simply means forgetfulness of one's previous experiences (previous material identity).\n\nMaterial existence is described as being full of miseries arising from birth, disease, old age, death, mind, weather, etc. To conquer ''[[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra|samsara]]'' (the cycle of death and rebirth) and become eligible for one of the different types of ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation), one has to first conquer ''[[Kama#In Hinduism|kama]]'' (material desires) and become [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|self-realized]]. The human form of life is most suitable for this spiritual journey, especially with the help of ''[[sadhu]]'' (self-realized saintly persons), ''[[sastra]]'' (revealed spiritual scriptures), and ''[[guru]]'' (self-realized spiritual masters), given all three are in agreement.\n\n===Islam===\n{{See also|Islamic view of death}}\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|left|A [[yahrzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]\n{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}\nThere are a [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|variety of beliefs about the afterlife]] within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death.
