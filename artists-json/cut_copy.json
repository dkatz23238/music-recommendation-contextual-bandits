Whitford was educated at [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] and studied graphic design at [[Monash University Faculty of Art Design & Architecture|Monash University]]. During his studies he became interested in dance music and began DJing while hosting a radio show. Around this time he bought a sampler and keyboards to experiment with.
