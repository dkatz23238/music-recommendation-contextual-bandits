It went on to receive a nomination for [[Best Metal Performance]] at the [[39th Annual Grammy Awards]]. In 1997, he began working on his debut solo studio album, ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe]]'', which was released in August 1998. A month later, Zombie officially disbanded White Zombie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/502053/singer-says-white-zombie-breakup-was-inevitable/|title=Singer Says White Zombie Breakup Was Inevitable|website=MTV}}</ref> ''Hellbilly Deluxe'' went on to sell over three million copies worldwide and spawned three singles. Zombie directed the horror film ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' in 2000, though the controversial project was not released until 2003. His second studio album, ''[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]'' (2001), became his second platinum album in the U.S.\n\nZombie directed ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005), a direct sequel to his prior film ''House of 1000 Corpses''. The project received a more positive reception than its predecessor. His third studio album, ''[[Educated Horses]]'' (2006), was a departure from his earlier recordings. The album became his third to enter the top ten of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], but saw a decrease in sales compared to his previous releases. Deciding to focus on his directing career, Zombie directed the horror film ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' (2007), a remake of the [[Halloween (1978 film)|1978 horror classic of the same name]]. The film became Zombie's highest-grossing film to date, though was generally received negatively by critics. He later directed ''[[Halloween II (2009 film)|Halloween II]]'' (2009), which failed to match the success of its predecessor. He released the animated film ''[[The Haunted World of El Superbeasto]]'' that same year. Zombie returned to music with the release of his fourth studio album, ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe 2]]'' (2010). The album peaked at number eight in the U.S., where it sold over 200,000 copies.\n\nIn 2012, Zombie released a [[Mondo Sex Head|second remix album]] and directed the horror film ''[[The Lords of Salem (film)|The Lords of Salem]]'', which was released in 2013; that year he also released his fifth studio album ''[[Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor]]''. Later he directed the horror film ''[[31 (film)|31]]''. Zombie released his next solo album, ''[[The Electric Warlock Acid Witch Satanic Orgy Celebration Dispenser]]'', in 2016, followed nearly five years later by his seventh studio album, ''[[The Lunar Injection Kool Aid Eclipse Conspiracy]]'' (2021).\n\nSince the beginning of his music career, Zombie's music and lyrics have featured notable horror and sci-fi themes.
