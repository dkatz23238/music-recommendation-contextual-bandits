While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanization|Germanized]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (\"bear\"), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Altglienicke]], [[Alt-Treptow]], [[Britz]], [[Buch (Berlin)|Buch]], [[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]], [[Gatow]], [[Karow (Berlin)|Karow]], [[Kladow]], [[K\u00f6penick]], [[Lankwitz]], [[L\u00fcbars]], [[Malchow (Berlin)|Malchow]], [[Marzahn]], [[Pankow (locality)|Pankow]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Rudow]], [[Schm\u00f6ckwitz]], [[Spandau (locality)|Spandau]], [[Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow]], [[Steglitz]], [[Tegel]] and [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]].

The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history during the 20th century. All of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, as well as the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|air raids]], fires, and street battles during the Second World War, and many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new business or residential districts and the main arteries. Much [[Ornament (art)|ornamentation]] on prewar buildings was destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], and in both postwar systems, as well as in the reunified Berlin, many important heritage structures have been [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' along with, the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the monumental buildings on [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and also the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. Many new buildings have been inspired by their historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|towers]] rise at various locations: [[Potsdamer Platz]], the [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two delineating the former centers of East and West Berlin, with the first representing a new Berlin of the 21st century, risen from the wastes of no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has five of the top 50 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.\n\nOver one-third of the city area consists of green space, woodlands, and water.<ref name=\"gruen\"/> Berlin's second-largest and most popular park, the [[Gro\u00dfer Tiergarten]], is located right in the center of the city. It covers an area of 210 hectares and stretches from [[Bahnhof Zoo]] in the City West to the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in the east.\n\nAmong famous streets, [[Unter den Linden]] and [[Friedrichstra\u00dfe]] are found in the city's old city centre (and were included in the former East Berlin). Some of the major streets in City West are [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] (or just Ku\u00b4damm) and [[Kantstra\u00dfe]].\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Berlin}}\n{{Further|List of sights in Berlin|List of tallest buildings in Berlin}}\n[[File:Gendarmenmarkt Panorama.jpg|thumb|Panorama of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]], showing the [[Konzerthaus Berlin]], flanked by the [[Neue Kirche, Berlin|German Church]] (left) and [[French Cathedral, Berlin|French Church]] (right)]]\n[[File:Berliner Dom seen from James Simon Park.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Cathedral]] at [[Museum Island]]]]\nThe [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{cvt|368|m}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|adj=mid|sp=us|-high}} observation floor. Starting here, the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers, and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n[[File:MJK 46430 Schloss Charlottenburg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charlottenburg Palace]]]]\n[[File:Berlin Hackesche H\u00f6fe1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]]]]\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[Spree (river)|River Spree]] houses [[#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|World Heritage]] site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17.

Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store.

It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{cvt|55|m}} and an observation deck {{cvt|126|m}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s, it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{cvt|891.1|km2}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

Each borough has several subdistricts or neighborhoods (''Ortsteile''), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighborhoods, colloquially called ''[[Kiez]]''. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin.<!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (''Rat der B\u00fcrgermeister''), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate.

East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.\n\nThere are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], Belgrade, S\u00e3o Paulo, [[Copenhagen]], Helsinki, [[Amsterdam]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], Oslo, [[Hanoi]], Shanghai, [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], New York City and [[Vienna]].
