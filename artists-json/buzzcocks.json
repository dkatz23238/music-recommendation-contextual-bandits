Trafford had previously been involved in electronic music,<ref name=\"urbis\" /> while McNeish had played rock.\n\nBy late 1975, Trafford and McNeish had recruited a drummer and formed an embryonic version of what would become Buzzcocks. The band formed, officially, in February 1976; McNeish assumed the stage name Pete Shelley and Trafford named himself Howard Devoto.<ref>Some sources claim that the surname came from a \"bus driver in Cambridge\" mentioned by a philosophy tutor at Bolton (e.g. Dave Wilson, 2004, ''Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to how Band Names Were Formed'', San Jose:, Cidermill Books, pp. 38\u20139).

Shelley and Devoto were impressed by what they saw and arranged for the Sex Pistols to come and perform at the [[Free Trade Hall|Lesser Free Trade Hall]] in Manchester, in June 1976. Buzzcocks intended to play at this concert, but the other musicians dropped out, and Shelley and Devoto were unable to recruit replacements in time for the gig. Once they had recruited bass guitarist [[Steve Diggle]] and drummer [[John Maher (Buzzcocks drummer)|John Maher]], they made their debut opening for the Sex Pistols' second Manchester concert in July 1976. A brief clip of Devoto-era Buzzcocks performing [[The Troggs]]' \"[[I Can't Control Myself]]\" appears in the ''Punk: Attitude'' documentary directed by [[Don Letts]]. In September 1976 the band travelled to London to perform at the two-day [[100 Club Punk Festival]], organised by [[Malcolm McLaren]]. Other performers included: the Sex Pistols, [[Subway Sect]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[The Clash]], [[The Vibrators]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] and the French band [[Stinky Toys]].\n\nBy the end of the year, Buzzcocks had recorded and released a four-track [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Spiral Scratch]]'', on their own ''New Hormones'' label, making them one of the first punk groups to establish an [[independent record label]], trailing only Fatal Records, created by [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] to release \"[[(I'm) Stranded (song)|(I'm) Stranded]]\". Produced by [[Martin Hannett]], the music was roughly recorded, insistently repetitive, and energetic. \"Boredom\" announced punk's rebellion against the status quo while templating a strident musical minimalism (the guitar solo consisting of two repeated notes). The demos recorded while Devoto was in the band were later issued officially as ''[[Time's Up (Buzzcocks album)|Time's Up]]''. Long available as a bootleg, this album includes the alternative takes of all the tracks from the ''Spiral Scratch'' EP as well as early version of tracks that later appeared on the official debut ''Another Music in a Different Kitchen''.\n\nAfter a few months, Devoto left the group, expressing his dissatisfaction at the direction that punk was taking in his statement: \"I don\u2019t like movements. What was once unhealthily fresh is now a clean old hat\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-12-12 |title=Howard Devoto on why it's the right time for a Magazine reunion |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/12/magazine-howard-devoto |access-date=2022-06-23 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref> He returned to college for a year, then formed [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]. Pete Shelley took on the vocal duties; his high-pitched, melodic singing stood in stark contrast to the gruff [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] vocal stylings of many punk contemporaries. Steve Diggle switched from bass to guitar, and Garth Davies (a.k.a. Garth Smith) rejoined on bass. While Davies appeared on the band's first Radio 1 Peel Session, in September 1977, his alleged unreliability led to his expulsion from the band. (He later joined New York band [[Dirty Looks (New York band)|Dirty Looks]].) Davies was replaced by [[Steve Garvey (musician)|Steve Garvey]]. This new line-up signed with [[United Artists Records]] \u2013 the signing itself was undertaken at Manchester's Electric Circus on 16 August 1977, the day Elvis Presley died.\n\n=== Signing to United Artists ===\nTheir first UA Buzzcocks single, \"[[Orgasm Addict]]\", was a playful examination of compulsive sexuality that was, and remains, uncommonly bold. The BBC refused to play the song, and the single did not sell well. Later, more ambiguous songs staked out a territory defined by Shelley's bisexuality and punk's aversion to serious examination of [[human sexuality]]. The next single, \"[[What Do I Get?]]\" reached the UK top 50 chart.<ref name=\"officialcharts\">{{cite web\n |url         = https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/\n |title       = The Official Charts Company \u2013 Buzzcocks\n |publisher   = [[Official Charts Company]]\n |access-date  = 31 July 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> \"Lipstick\", the B-side to \"Promises,\" shared the same ascending progression of notes in its chorus as [[Magazine (band)|Magazine's]] first single, \"Shot By Both Sides,\" also released in 1978.\n\nA string of successful singles followed with their signature song, \"[[Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)]]\" reaching number 12 in the UK charts in October 1978. Regular TV appearances and record releases kept their profile high and ensured their influence would remain.\n\nTheir original career produced three LPs: ''[[Another Music in a Different Kitchen]]'', ''[[Love Bites (Buzzcocks album)|Love Bites]]'', and ''[[A Different Kind of Tension]]'', all of which made the UK Top Thirty. Their distinctive sound was a marriage of catchy pop melodies with punk guitar energy, backed by an unusually tight and skilled [[rhythm section]]. They advanced drastically in musical and lyrical sophistication: by the end they were quoting USA writer [[William S. Burroughs]] (\"A Different Kind of Tension\"), declaiming their catechism in the anthem \"I Believe\", and tuning in to a fantasy radio station on which their songs could be heard (\"Radio Nine\"). In September 1980, the double 'A' side \"Why She's A Girl From The Chainstore/Are Everything\" made the Top 75, their last charting single.\n\nIn parallel with Buzzcocks, Pete Shelley formed a more experimental and [[post-punk]] band, The Tiller Boys, along with Eric Random and Francis Cookson, while Steve Garvey joined [[The Teardrops (band)|The Teardrops]] in 1978, along with [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]'s Tony Friel and [[Karl Burns]]; both bands were releasing material in late 1970s and broke up at the same time as Buzzcocks.\n\n=== Break-up and reunions ===\n\nAfter recording demos for a fourth album the group disbanded in 1981; Shelley took up a solo career. Diggle and Maher formed [[Flag of Convenience (band)|Flag of Convenience]], and released several singles between 1982 and 1989. Garvey formed [[Motivation (band)|Motivation]] and joined [[Blue Orchids]], moving to New York shortly afterwards to continue with the first band. Maher had joined [[Wah!]] by the time Buzzcocks broke up. Shelley and Devoto teamed up in 2002 for the first time since 1976, producing the album ''[[Buzzkunst]]'', 'Kunst' being the German word for 'Art'. The album was a mix of electronic music and punk.\n\nJohn Maher owns and runs John Maher Racing, a vintage Volkswagen performance tuning workshop on the [[Isle of Harris]], Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmaherracing.co.uk/|title=John Maher Racing|website=Johnmaherracing.co.uk|access-date=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430102003/http://www.johnmaherracing.co.uk/|archive-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>  He has built and raced several [[Volkswagen Beetle]]s.

Bollocks]]'' to create the title of the long-running UK comedy TV panel game show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''. Diggle claimed in his autobiography that he and Shelley had only granted the BBC use of their name under the impression that it would be a one-off, probably unsuccessful pilot, and that they are now mildly disgruntled that the name is more readily associated in Britain with the TV series than with their band.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Diggle |first1=S. |last2=Rawlings |first2=T. |title=Harmony in My Head |publisher=Helter Skelter |year=2003 |isbn=1-900924-37-4}}</ref> Shelley himself appeared on the programme in 2000, where host [[Mark Lamarr]] introduced Shelley by saying that without Buzzcocks 'there'd be no [[The Smiths|Smiths]] or [[Radiohead]], and this show would be called ''Never Mind [[Joan Armatrading]]!'\"''{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n== Discography ==\n{{Main|Buzzcocks discography}}\n\n; Studio albums\n\n* ''[[Another Music in a Different Kitchen]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Love Bites (album)|Love Bites]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[A Different Kind of Tension]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Trade Test Transmissions]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[All Set]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[Modern (Buzzcocks album)|Modern]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Buzzcocks (album)|Buzzcocks]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Flat-Pack Philosophy]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Way (Buzzcocks album)|The Way]]'' (2014)\n* ''Sonics in the Soul'' (2022)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Buzzcocks}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{AllMusic|id=p3809|label=Buzzcocks}}\n\n{{Buzzcocks}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Buzzcocks| ]]\n[[Category:1976 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:English punk rock groups]]\n[[Category:English new wave musical groups]]\n[[Category:United Artists Records artists]]\n[[Category:I.R.S.
