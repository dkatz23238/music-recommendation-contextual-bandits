After briefly using the name Polarbear, releasing the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Starfighter Pilot]]'' (1997) and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its lineup. Their first two studio albums, ''[[Songs for Polarbears]]'' (1998) and ''[[When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up]]'' (2001), released by the independent record label [[Jeepster Records]], were commercially unsuccessful. The band then signed to the major record label [[Polydor Records]] in 2002.\n\nConnolly joined Snow Patrol in 2002, and after their major-label debut album, ''[[Final Straw]]'', the following year, with \"[[Run (Snow Patrol song)|Run]]\", the album's biggest hit, the band rose to national fame. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|5\u00d7 platinum]] in the UK. Their next studio album, ''[[Eyes Open]]'' (2006), and its hit single, \"[[Chasing Cars]]\"\u2014reported in 2019 to be the most-played song of the 21st century on UK radio\u2014propelled the band to greater international fame. The album topped the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was the best-selling British album of the year. In 2008, Snow Patrol released their fifth studio album, ''[[A Hundred Million Suns]]''; then, in 2009, they released their first compilation album, ''[[Up to Now]]''; and, in 2011, their sixth studio album, ''[[Fallen Empires (album)|Fallen Empires]]'', was published. The band released their seventh album, ''[[Wildness (album)|Wildness]]'', on 25 May 2018.\n\nDuring the course of their career, Snow Patrol have won seven [[Meteor Music Awards#Winners|Meteor Ireland Music Awards]] and been nominated for six [[Brit Awards]] and one [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]. ''Final Straw'', ''Eyes Open'', and ''A Hundred Million Suns'' have sold ten million copies worldwide, combined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a176894/snow-patrol-to-release-greatest-hits.html|title=Snow Patrol to release greatest hits|last=Balls|first=David|date=11 September 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|access-date=11 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1994\u20131997)===\n[[File:Shrug - December 1994.jpg|thumb|Snow Patrol originated from a band called [[Shrug (band)|Shrug]], which formed in 1994 and consisted of [[Gary Lightbody]], Michael Morrison, and [[Mark McClelland]].]]\n\nSnow Patrol were originally formed in early 1994 by [[University of Dundee]] students [[Gary Lightbody]], [[Mark McClelland]], and Michael Morrison under the name [[Shrug (band)|Shrug]].<ref name=\"brianbebo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/music/interviews/snow-patrol-video-interview-quiz-biography-pictures.html |title=Snow Patrol |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |access-date=14 October 2008 }}</ref> The band started by performing gigs at the university and surrounding pubs such as Lucifer's Mill. Their first [[Extended play|EP]] was entitled ''The Yogurt vs. Yoghurt Debate''. In 1996, they changed their name to Polarbear to avoid issues with any American bands that were also named Shrug. Shortly afterwards, drummer Michael Morrison left the group after suffering a breakdown and returned to Northern Ireland.
