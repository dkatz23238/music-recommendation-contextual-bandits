Born into a musical family and raised in the Irish-speaking area of [[Gweedore]], [[County Donegal]], Enya began her music career when she joined her family's Celtic folk band [[Clannad]] in 1980 on keyboards and backing vocals. She left the group in 1982 with their manager and producer [[Nicky Ryan]] to pursue a solo career, with Ryan's wife [[Roma Ryan]] as her lyricist. Enya developed her sound over the following four years with multitracked vocals and keyboards with elements of [[Celtic music|Celtic]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[Gregorian chant|church]], [[New-age music|new age]], [[World music|world]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[Irish traditional music|Irish folk music]].\n\nEnya's first projects as a solo artist included soundtrack work for ''[[The Frog Prince (1984 film)|The Frog Prince]]'' (1984) and the 1987 [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[The Celts (BBC documentary)|The Celts]]'', which was released as her debut album, ''[[Enya (album)|Enya]]'' (1987). She signed with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music UK]], which granted her considerable artistic freedom and minimal interference from the label. The commercial and critical success of ''[[Watermark (Enya album)|Watermark]]'' (1988) propelled her to worldwide fame, helped by the UK number one and the international hit single \"[[Orinoco Flow]]\". This was followed by the multi-million-selling albums ''[[Shepherd Moons]]'' (1991), ''[[The Memory of Trees]]'' (1995), and ''[[A Day Without Rain]]'' (2000). Sales of the latter and its lead single, \"[[Only Time]]\", surged in the United States following its use in the media coverage of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Following ''[[Amarantine (album)|Amarantine]]'' (2005) and ''[[And Winter Came...]]'' (2008), Enya took a four-year break from music. She returned in 2012 and released her eighth album, ''[[Dark Sky Island]]'' (2015).\n\n[[Enya discography|Enya's discography]] has sold 26.5 million [[Recording Industry Association of America|certified albums]] in the United States<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists |title=RIAA: Top Selling Artists |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |access-date=13 June 2012}}</ref> and an estimated 80 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34614590 |title=Enya says tour would be 'very possible' |work=[[BBC News]] |date=23 October 2015 |first=Mark |last=Savage |access-date=27 October 2016}}</ref> ''A Day Without Rain'' (2000) remains the best-selling new-age album, with an estimated 16 million copies sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts-decade-end/new-age-albums?year=2009 |title=New Age Albums |magazine=Billboard |access-date=17 January 2012}}</ref> Enya has won numerous awards, including seven [[World Music Award]]s, four [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best New Age Album|Best New Age Album]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1858520.stm |title=Enrique triumphs at Monaco awards |work=BBC News |date=7 March 2002 |access-date=6 December 2014}}</ref> and an [[Ivor Novello Award]].
