Originally called '''Kaspir''', the band was formed in 1996 and currently consists of  [[Deryck Whibley]] (lead vocals, guitars, keyboards), [[Dave Baksh]] (lead guitar, backing vocals), [[Jason McCaslin|Jason \"Cone\" McCaslin]] (bass, backing vocals), [[Tom Thacker (musician)|Tom Thacker]] (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals), and [[Frank Zummo]] (drums, percussion, occasional backing vocals).\n\nIn 1999, Sum 41 signed an international record deal with [[Island Records]] and released its first EP, ''[[Half Hour of Power]]'', in 2000. The band released its debut album, ''[[All Killer No Filler]]'', in 2001. The album achieved mainstream success with its first single, \"[[Fat Lip]]\", which reached number one on the [[Alternative Songs|''Billboard'' Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and remains the band's most successful single to date. The album's next singles \"[[In Too Deep (Sum 41 song)|In Too Deep]]\" and \"[[Motivation (Sum 41 song)|Motivation]]\" also achieved commercial success. ''All Killer No Filler'' was certified platinum in both the United States and the United Kingdom and triple platinum in Canada. In 2002, the band released ''[[Does This Look Infected?]]'', which was also a commercial and critical success. The singles \"[[The Hell Song]]\" and \"[[Still Waiting (Sum 41 song)|Still Waiting]]\" both charted highly on the modern rock charts.\n\nThe band released its next album, ''[[Chuck (Sum 41 album)|Chuck]]'', in 2004, led by singles \"[[We're All to Blame]]\" and \"[[Pieces (Sum 41 song)|Pieces]]\". The album proved successful, peaking at number 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In 2007, the band released ''[[Underclass Hero]]'', which was met with a mixed reception, but became the band's highest charting album to date. It was also the band's last album on [[Aquarius Records (Canada)|Aquarius Records]]. The band released the album ''[[Screaming Bloody Murder]]'', on [[Island Records]] in 2011 to a generally positive reception, though it fell short of its predecessors' commercial success. The band's sixth studio album, ''[[13 Voices]]'' was released in 2016. [[Independent Music Companies Association|IMPALA]] awarded the album with a double gold award for 150,000 sold copies across Europe. The band's seventh studio album ''[[Order in Decline]]'' was released on July 19, 2019. The band is in production of their eighth studio album titled ''Heaven and Hell''. A release date has yet to be announced.\n\nThe band often performs more than 300 times each year and holds long global [[Concert tour|tours]], most of which last more than a year. The group have been nominated for seven [[Juno Awards]] and won twice \u2013 [[Juno Award for Group of the Year|Group of the Year]] in 2003, and [[Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year|Rock Album of the Year]] for ''Chuck'' in 2005.
