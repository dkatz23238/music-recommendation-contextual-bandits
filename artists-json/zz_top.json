For 51 years, they comprised vocalist-guitarist [[Billy Gibbons]], drummer [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] and vocalist-bassist [[Dusty Hill]], until Hill's death in 2021. ZZ Top developed a signature sound based on Gibbons' [[blues]] guitar style and Hill and Beard's [[rhythm section]]. They are popular for their live performances, sly and humorous lyrics, and the matching appearances of Gibbons and Hill, who wore sunglasses, hats and long beards.\n\nZZ Top formed after the demise of [[Moving Sidewalks]], Gibbons' previous band, in 1969. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and ''[[Fandango!]]'' (1975), and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, ZZ Top had become renowned in North America for its live act, including the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] (1976\u2014 1977), which was a critical and commercial success.\n\nAfter a hiatus, ZZ Top returned in 1979 with a new musical direction and image, with Gibbons and Hill wearing sunglasses and matching chest-length beards. With the album ''[[El Loco]]'' (1981), they began to experiment with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. They established a more mainstream sound and gained international success with ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]]. The popularity of these albums' music videos, including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", gave them mass exposure on television channel [[MTV]] and made them prominent artists in 1980s pop culture. The ''Afterburner'' tour set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. \n\nAfter gaining additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990), and its [[Recycler Tour|accompanying tour]], the group's experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003). They most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin' 50'' (2019), a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary. By the time of Hill's death in 2021, ZZ Top had become the longest-running band with an unchanged lineup in the history of popular music.<ref>{{cite web|first= Brett |last= Milano |title= Oldest Bands in Music: Acts That Defy the Laws of Age and Time |website= uDiscover Music |date= August 10, 2021 |access-date= August 20, 2021 |url= https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/oldest-bands-in-music-history/ |language= en-US}}</ref> Per Hill's wishes, he was replaced by their longtime [[guitar tech]] Elwood Francis on bass.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |work= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |access-date= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |access-date= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, the members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a small apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is at the top\" which gave him the idea of naming the band \"ZZ Top\".<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |access-date= September 13, 2015 |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |archive-date= October 7, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151007205644/https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick\", in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm\". Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick\", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement in late 1969. At this moment, all three members of the band were 20 years old. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at a Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970. The show was booked by [[KLVI]] radio personality Al Caldwell, who was also instrumental in broadcasting the band's first recordings.<ref>{{cite web|first=Craig |last=Hlavaty |title=ZZ Top played its first show together 50 years ago |website=houstonchronicle.com |date=February 10, 2020 |access-date=May 25, 2022 |url=https://preview.houstonchronicle.com/music/zz-top-first-concert-1970-6073072}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single, \"[[Francine (song)|Francine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |access-date= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973, which reached the No. 8 position on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' albums chart by early 1974. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process\". The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. During this tour, ZZ Top recorded the live tracks that would fill one side of their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]''. ''Fandango!'', which also contained one side of new studio songs, was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nZZ Top began the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] in May 1976 to support ''Fandango!'', and the tour continued through 1977 with 98 shows over 18 months.<ref>{{cite web|title=Live Rattlesnakes and Rock n' Roll: The Story of ZZ Top's \"Worldwide Texas Tour\" |last=Moreno |first=Ricky |website=stmuscholars.com |date=October 22, 2020 |access-date=May 25, 2022 |url=https://stmuscholars.org/live-rattlesnakes-and-rock-n-roll-the-story-of-zz-tops-worldwide-texas-tour/}}</ref> ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', recorded during a break in the tour and released in November 1976, was the final ZZ Top album under their contract with London Records.
