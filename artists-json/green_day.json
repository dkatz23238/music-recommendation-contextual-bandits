Touring guitarist [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his touring role in 2016. Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called '''Sweet Children''', and they were part of the [[Punk rock in California|late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene]] that emerged from the [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]]. In 1994, their major-label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands [[Bad Religion]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], and [[Social Distortion]], Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\n\nThough the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful, with the former two reaching double platinum status, while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[\u00a1Uno!]]'', ''[[\u00a1Dos!]]'', and ''[[\u00a1Tr\u00e9!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, ''[[Revolution Radio]]'', was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|'' Billboard'' 200]]. The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'', was released on February 7, 2020.\n\nGreen Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling artists]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/09/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-green-day-nine-inch-nails-lou-reed/16852249/|title=Green Day, Nine Inch Nails among Rock Hall nominees|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 9, 2014|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref> The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''[[Dookie]]'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.\n\nIn 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway.
