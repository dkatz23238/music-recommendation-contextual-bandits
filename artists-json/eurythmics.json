They were both previously in [[The Tourists]], a band which broke up in 1980. The duo released their first studio album, ''[[In the Garden (Eurythmics album)|In the Garden]]'', in 1981 to little success, but went on to achieve global acclaim when their second album ''[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (album)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]'', was released in 1983. The [[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)|title track]] became a worldwide hit, reaching #2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and #6 in Australia, before hitting #1 in Canada and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The duo went on to release a string of hit singles and albums, including \"[[Love Is a Stranger]]\", \"[[There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)]]\" and \"[[Here Comes the Rain Again]]\", before they split up in 1990. \n\nStewart became a sought-after record producer, while Lennox began a solo recording career in 1992 with her debut album ''[[Diva (Annie Lennox album)|Diva]]''. After almost a decade apart, Eurythmics reunited to record their ninth album, ''[[Peace (Eurythmics album)|Peace]]'', released in late 1999. They reunited again in 2005 to release the single \"[[I've Got a Life]]\", as part of a new compilation album, ''[[Ultimate Collection (Eurythmics album)|Ultimate Collection]]''.\n\nEurythmics have sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2010/08/18/eurythmics-star-annie-lennox-champions-charity-work-91466-27088871/|title=Annie Lennox champions charity work|work=walesonline|date=18 August 2010|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> The duo have won an [[MTV Video Music Award]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] in 1984, the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] in 1987, the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1999, and in 2005 were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]].

After releasing one single as the Catch in 1977, the band evolved into [[the Tourists]]. Stewart and Lennox were also romantically involved. The Tourists achieved some commercial success, but the experience was reportedly an unhappy one. Personal and musical tensions existed within the group, whose main songwriter was [[Peet Coombes]], and legal wrangling happened with the band's management, publishers and record labels. Lennox and Stewart felt the fixed band line-up was an inadequate vehicle to explore their experimental creative leanings and decided their next project should be much more flexible and free from artistic compromise. They were interested in creating pop music, but wanted freedom to experiment with electronics and the avant-garde.\n\nIt was in a hotel in [[Wagga Wagga]], Australia, while playing around with a portable mini-synthesizer that Lennox and Stewart decided to become a duo.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eurythmics began in Wagga, says Dave Stewart|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/eurythmics-began-in-wagga-says-dave-stewart-20131105-2wy1k.html|access-date=5 November 2013|website=Smh.com.au|date=5 November 2013}}</ref> Calling themselves Eurythmics (after the [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|pedagogical exercise system]] that Lennox had encountered as a child{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}), they decided to keep themselves as the only permanent members and songwriters, and involve others in the collaboration \"on the basis of mutual compatibility and availability\". The duo signed to [[RCA Records]]. At this time, Lennox and Stewart also split as a couple. During the period that Lennox and Stewart were in The Tourists, and later as Eurythmics, they were managed by Kenny Smith and Sandra Turnbull of Hyper Kinetics Ltd.\n\nThey recorded their first album in [[Cologne]] with [[Conny Plank]] (who had produced the later Tourists sessions). This resulted in the album ''[[In the Garden (Eurythmics album)|In the Garden]]'', released in October 1981. The album mixed [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], [[krautrock]] and [[electropop]] influences, and featured contributions from [[Holger Czukay]] and [[Jaki Liebezeit]] (of [[Can (band)|Can]]), drummer [[Clem Burke]] (of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]), Robert G\u00f6rl (of [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|D.A.F.]]), and flautist [[Tim Wheater]]. A couple of the songs were co-written by guitarist Roger Pomphrey (later a TV director). The album was not a commercial success (though the debut single \"[[Never Gonna Cry Again]]\" made the UK charts at No.&nbsp;63).<ref name=\"officialcharts\">{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=The Official Charts Company \u2013 Eurythmics |website=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=10 August 2009}}</ref> Lennox and Stewart then activated their new Eurythmics mode of operation by touring the record as a duo, accompanied by backing tracks and electronics, carted around the country by themselves in a horse-box.\n\nDuring 1982, the duo retreated to [[Chalk Farm]] in London and used a bank loan to establish a small eight-track studio above a picture framing factory, giving them freedom to record without having to pay expensive studio fees. They began to employ much more electronics in their music, collaborating with Raynard Faulkner and Adam Williams, recording many tracks in the studio and playing live using various line-up permutations. However, the three new singles they released that year (\"[[This Is the House]]\", \"[[The Walk (Eurythmics song)|The Walk]]\" and \"[[Love Is a Stranger]]\") all performed badly on initial release in the UK. Although their mode of operation had given them the creative freedom they desired, commercial success still eluded them and the responsibility of personally running so many of their affairs (down to transporting their own stage equipment) took its toll. Lennox apparently suffered at least one [[nervous breakdown]] during this period, while Stewart was hospitalised with a [[pneumothorax|collapsed lung]].<ref name=\"obrien\"/>\n\n===1983\u20131984: ''Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)'' and ''Touch''===\n{{Quote box|width=29%|align=right|quote=MTV has paved the way for a host of invaders from abroad: Def Leppard, Adam Ant, Madness, Eurythmics, the Fixx and Billy Idol, to name a few.

The successful [[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)|title track]] featured a dark and powerful sequenced synth bass line and a dramatic video that introduced the now orange crew-cut Lennox to audiences. The song reached No.&nbsp;2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/> becoming one of the year's biggest sellers, #6 in Australia, and later topped the Canadian chart and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The band's fortunes changed immensely from this moment on, and Lennox quickly became a pop icon, gracing the covers of numerous magazines including ''Rolling Stone''. Their previous single, \"Love Is a Stranger\", was also re-released and became another chart success. The video for the song saw Lennox in many different character guises, a concept she would employ in various subsequent videos. The album's working title was ''Invisible Hands'' (as was a track left off the album), inspiring the name of the British independent company Invisible Hands Music \u2013 known for releasing music by [[Hugh Cornwell]], [[Mick Karn]] and [[Hazel O'Connor]]. The album also featured a cover of the 1968 [[Sam & Dave]] hit \"Wrap It Up\", performed as a duet between Lennox and [[Green Gartside]] of [[Scritti Politti]].\n\nThe duo quickly recorded a follow-up album, ''[[Touch (Eurythmics album)|Touch]]'', which was released in November 1983. It became the duo's first No.&nbsp;1 album in the UK, and also spawned three major hit singles. \"[[Who's That Girl? (Eurythmics song)|Who's That Girl?]]\" was a top 3 hit in the UK,<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/> the video depicting Lennox as both a blonde chanteuse and as a gender-bending Elvis Presley clone. It also featured cameo appearances by Hazel O'Connor, [[Bananarama]] (including Stewart's future wife, [[Siobhan Fahey]]), [[Kate Garner]] of [[Haysi Fantayzee]], [[Thereza Bazar]] of [[Dollar (band)|Dollar]], [[Jay Aston]] and [[Cheryl Baker]] of [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]], [[Kiki Dee]], [[Jacquie O'Sullivan]] and the gender-bending pop singer [[Marilyn (singer)|Marilyn]], who would go on to musical success of his own that same year. The upbeat, calypso-flavoured \"[[Right by Your Side (Eurythmics song)|Right by Your Side]]\" showed a different side of Eurythmics altogether and also made the Top 10, and \"[[Here Comes the Rain Again]]\" (No. 8 in the UK,<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/> No. 4 in the US) was an orchestral/synth ballad (with orchestrations by [[Michael Kamen]]).\n\nIn 1984 RCA released ''[[Touch Dance]]'', an [[Extended play|EP]] of [[remix]]es of four of the tracks from ''Touch'', aimed at the club market. The remixes were by prominent [[New York City]] producers [[Francois Kevorkian]] and [[John Benitez|John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]]. Also released in 1984 was Eurythmics' soundtrack album ''[[1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)]]''. [[Virgin Group|Virgin Films]] had contracted the band to provide a soundtrack for [[Michael Radford]]'s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984 film)|modern film adaptation]] of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. However, Radford later said that the music had been \"foisted\" on his film against his wishes, and that Virgin had replaced most of [[Dominic Muldowney]]'s original orchestral score with the Eurythmics soundtrack (including the song \"[[Julia (Eurythmics song)|Julia]]\", which was heard during the end credits). Nevertheless, the record was presented as \"music derived from the original score of Eurythmics for the Michael Radford film version of Orwell's ''1984''\". Eurythmics charged that they had been misled by the film's producers as well,<ref>{{cite magazine |date=January 1992 |title=Eurythmics |magazine=[[Record Collector]] |publisher=Diamond Publishing |pages=14\u201315}}</ref> and the album was withdrawn from the market for a period while matters were litigated. The album's first single, \"[[Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four) (Eurythmics song)|Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four)]]\", was a top 5 hit in the UK,<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/> Australia and across Europe, and a major dance success in the United States.\n\n===1985\u20131986: ''Be Yourself Tonight'' and new musical direction===\n[[File:Eurythmics 06101986 02 270.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Annie Lennox performing during Revenge Tour in 1986]]\nThe duo's next album, ''[[Be Yourself Tonight]]'', was produced in a week in Paris and spent 4 weeks at #1 in Australia.  It showcased much more of a \"band style\" and a centred sound (with an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] influence), with real drums, brass, and much more guitar from Stewart. Almost a dozen other musicians were enlisted, including members of [[Tom Petty]]'s [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|Heartbreakers]], guest harmonica from [[Stevie Wonder]], bass guitar from [[Dean Garcia]], string arrangements by Michael Kamen, and Lennox singing duets with [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Elvis Costello]]. It continued the duo's transatlantic chart domination in 1985, and contained four hit singles: \"[[Would I Lie to You? (Eurythmics song)|Would I Lie to You?]]\" was a US Billboard top five hit and Australian #1, while \"[[There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)]]\" (featuring Wonder's harmonica contribution) became their first and only UK #1 single.<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/> The [[feminism|feminist]] anthem \"[[Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves]]\" (a duet with Aretha Franklin, though originally intended for [[Tina Turner]]), and \"[[It's Alright (Baby's Coming Back)]]\" also rode high in the charts. In September 1985, Eurythmics performed \"Would I Lie to You?\" at the [[1985 MTV Video Music Awards]] at the [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/performers.jhtml|title=1985 MTV Video Music Awards|publisher=Mtv.com|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1986\u20131990: ''Revenge'', ''Savage'' and ''We Too Are One''===\n[[Image:David A. Stewart Rock am Ring 1987.jpg|left|thumb|[[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] at [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|Rock am Ring]] in West Germany, 1987.]]\nEurythmics released their next album, ''[[Revenge (Eurythmics album)|Revenge]]'', in 1986. The album continued their move towards a band sound, verging on an [[album-oriented rock|AOR]]-pop/rock sound. Sales continued to be strong in the UK and internationally, but were somewhat slower in the US, though \"[[Missionary Man (Eurythmics song)|Missionary Man]]\" reached No. 14 on the US Hot 100 chart and went all the way to No.&nbsp;1 on the US Album Oriented Rock chart (AOR). ''Revenge'' would eventually certify double Platinum in the UK and Gold in the US, and spend 40 weeks in the Australian top 10 where it reached #2.  The band went on a massive worldwide tour in support of the album, and a live concert video from the Australian leg of the tour was released.\n\nIn 1987, Lennox and Stewart released the album ''[[Savage (Eurythmics album)|Savage]]''. This saw a fairly radical change within the group's sound, being based mainly around programmed samples and drum loops (Lennox would later say that where ''Revenge'' was more of a Stewart album in sound, ''Savage'' was more of a Lennox one). Lyrically the songs showed an even darker, more obsessive side to Lennox's writing. A video album was also made, directed by [[Sophie Muller]], with a video for each song. This was largely a concept piece, following characters portrayed by Lennox, specifically one of a frustrated housewife-turned-vamp (as exemplified in \"[[Beethoven (I Love to Listen To)]]\", a UK top 30 and Australian #13 hit<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/>). The brazen, sexually charged rocker \"[[I Need a Man (Eurythmics song)|I Need a Man]]\" remains a Eurythmics staple, as does \"[[You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart]]\". Much less commercial than the two previous albums, ''Savage'' was mostly ignored in the US, although rock radio in more progressive markets supported \"I Need a Man\". In the duo's native UK however, the album was a top 10 success and was certified Platinum.\n\nIn 1989, Eurythmics released the album ''[[We Too Are One]]'', which entered the UK Album Chart at No.&nbsp;1 (their second No.&nbsp;1 album after ''Touch''<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/>) and gave the duo four UK Top 30 hit singles. The album was a return to the rock/pop sound of their mid-80s albums and was certified Double Platinum in the UK, and reached #7 in Australia, but was less successful in the US (although the single \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Eurythmics song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\" grazed the Billboard Top 40). Other singles from the album included \"[[Revival (Eurythmics song)|Revival]]\", \"[[The King and Queen of America]]\" and \"[[Angel (Eurythmics song)|Angel]]\". Accompanying the album, the duo conducted their ''Revival'' world tour from 8 September 1989 to 25 January 1990.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIG0251 1989-09-08 : Eurythmics - Point Depot, Dublin, Ireland - Ultimate Eurythmics |url=https://eurythmics-ultimate.com/concerts/gig0318-1990-01-25-eurythmics-praca-da-apotoese-rio-de-janeiro-brazil/ |access-date=11 May 2019 |language=en |quote=Artist: Eurythmics.

Stewart began writing film soundtracks and had a big international hit in 1990 with the instrumental track \"[[Lily Was Here]]\" (featuring saxophonist [[Candy Dulfer]]). The single reached No.&nbsp;6 in the UK<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/archive/ |title=The Official Charts Company \u2013 David A Stewart Featuring Candy Dulfer \u2013 Lily Was Here |website=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=6 August 2010}}</ref> and the Top 20 throughout much of Europe and the US, and top 10 in Australia.  A [[Lily Was Here (soundtrack)|soundtrack of the same name]] was also released, produced and largely written by Stewart. He formed a band called [[The Spiritual Cowboys]], releasing two albums with this group in the early 1990s. Lennox took time off from her career to have a baby and to consider a life after Eurythmics. Accordingly, the duo had very little communication with each other from 1991 to 1998. In 1991, Eurythmics' ''[[Greatest Hits (Eurythmics album)|Greatest Hits]]'' collection was released, entering the UK album chart at No.&nbsp;1 and spending a total of 10 weeks at that position,<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/> plus 7 weeks at #1 in Australia as well as becoming a massive worldwide seller. New remixes of \"Sweet Dreams\" and \"Love Is a Stranger\" were also released as singles at this time. During 1993, a live album entitled ''[[Live 1983\u20131989]]'' featuring recordings from various years throughout Eurythmics' career was also released.\n\nIn 1992, Lennox released her first solo album, ''[[Diva (Annie Lennox album)|Diva]]''. The album was a critical and popular success, entering the UK album chart at No.&nbsp;1 and achieving quadruple platinum status (more than any Eurythmics studio album had done), as well as producing a string of five hit singles. She followed this up in 1995 with her second album, ''[[Medusa (Annie Lennox album)|Medusa]]'', an album of cover versions. It became her second No. 1 album in the UK, reaching double platinum status both there and in the US.\n\nStewart, meanwhile, released the solo albums ''Greetings from the Gutter'' (1995), and ''Sly-Fi'' (1998), but neither was commercially successful.\n\n===1999\u20132005: ''Peace'' and ''Ultimate Collection''===\n[[File:Eurythmicsonthetodayshow.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart and Lennox performing on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' in November 2005.]]\nIn the late 1990s, Eurythmics reunited and recorded a new album, ''[[Peace (Eurythmics album)|Peace]]'', which was released in 1999. The single \"[[I Saved the World Today]]\" reached No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart,<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/> and a remix of \"[[17 Again (song)|17 Again]]\" gave the duo their first chart-topper on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart. The band also embarked on a world tour, dubbed the \"Peacetour\", to support the album. The tour started on 18 September 1999 at Cologne's [[K\u00f6lnarena]] and ended on 6 December 1999 at the [[London Docklands Arena]] (which was filmed and released on video and DVD). All proceeds from the tour went to [[Greenpeace]] and [[Amnesty International]]. The year 2000 saw numerous European festival appearances by Eurythmics (at Germany's Rock am Ring, among others). In 2001, Stewart performed with [[U2]] for the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert. In 2002, he collaborated with [[Bryan Ferry]] on his album ''[[Frantic (album)|Frantic]]''.\n\nIn June 2003, Lennox released her third solo album, entitled ''[[Bare (Annie Lennox album)|Bare]]'', which was a top 5 hit in the UK and the US., with three tracks reaching the top of the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. She also recorded the song \"[[Into the West (song)|Into the West]]\" for [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', where it appeared as the closing theme and earned Lennox the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]]. In November 2003, Eurythmics played three songs at the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, for which Stewart was one of the primary organisers. They played an unplugged version of \"Here Comes the Rain Again\", \"[[7 Seconds (song)|7 Seconds]]\" with [[Youssou N'Dour]] and \"Sweet Dreams\". Stewart collaborated with [[The Rolling Stones]] vocalist [[Mick Jagger]] on the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Alfie (2004 film)|Alfie]]'', released in 2004, including the critically acclaimed \"[[Old Habits Die Hard]]\", which won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song from a Motion Picture]].\n\nOn 7 November 2005, Eurythmics released ''[[Ultimate Collection (Eurythmics album)|Ultimate Collection]]'', a remastered greatest hits package with two new songs. One of them, \"[[I've Got a Life]]\", was released as a single and reached No.&nbsp;14 on the UK Singles Chart<ref name=\"officialcharts\"/> as well as spending three consecutive weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play in the US. Lennox and Stewart appeared on a number of TV shows to promote their new compilation album, which was a Top 5 hit and certified Platinum in the UK. On 14 November 2005, the duo's label, RCA, re-released their eight studio albums in remastered and expanded editions featuring rare [[B-side]]s, remixes and unreleased songs. The remasters were made available separately with expanded artwork, and also together in a collector's [[box set]], entitled ''[[Boxed (Eurythmics)|Boxed]]''. However, the 1984 soundtrack album ''1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)'' was not included in this re-release campaign as [[Virgin Records]] holds the rights to that album. Also in 2005, Eurythmics were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnafiles.net/dna/awards/awards.htm |title=Eurythmics discography \u2013 awards |website=Dnafiles.net |access-date=10 August 2010}}</ref> In 2007, Lennox resumed her solo career with her fourth album, ''[[Songs of Mass Destruction]]'', which was a top 10 success in the UK and the US.
