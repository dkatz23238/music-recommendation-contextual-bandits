Through her parents' efforts, Rimes began performing in various programs, including musical theater and local music contests. Developing a local following, Rimes recorded two studio albums as a preteen. These records helped bring her to the attention of Nashville label [[Curb Records]]. She signed a contract with Curb at age 13 and released 1996's \"Blue\". It became a top ten hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country songs chart. Her 1996 [[Blue (LeAnn Rimes album)|album of the same name]] sold over six million copies and established her as a major country artist. In 1997, Rimes crossed over into pop music with \"[[How Do I Live]]\". The song became one of the best-selling singles of the 1990s. An extended mix of the track was included on her next album ''[[You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs]]'', which sold over four million copies. Over the next several years, Rimes's singles demonstrated further crossover success. These include \"[[I Need You (LeAnn Rimes song)|I Need You]]\" and \"[[Can't Fight the Moonlight]]\".\n\nBreaking away from her father's management in the 2000s, Rimes experimented with several styles. In 2002, she released the pop-inspired ''[[Twisted Angel]]'' and in 2004 released the Christmas record ''[[What a Wonderful World (LeAnn Rimes album)|What a Wonderful World]]''. She returned to her country origins with 2005's ''[[This Woman (LeAnn Rimes album)|This Woman]]'', which produced three country hits. A similar album project followed in 2007 titled ''[[Family (LeAnn Rimes album)|Family]]''. After appearing in the 2009 television film ''[[Northern Lights (2009 film)|Northern Lights]]'', Rimes began an affair with fellow actor [[Eddie Cibrian]]. The relationship received notable media attention over the next several years. Her 2013 album, ''[[Spitfire (LeAnn Rimes album)|Spitfire]]'' chronicled the affair and her personal difficulties from the experience.\n\nEnding her long-time professional relationship with Curb Records, Rimes released a series of Christmas recordings over the next several years. This included 2014's ''[[One Christmas: Chapter 1]]'' and 2015's ''[[Today Is Christmas]]''. In 2016, she returned with the pop-flavored studio effort ''[[Remnants (LeAnn Rimes album)|Remnants]]'', which featured two ''Billboard'' dance club hits. Her most recent efforts include a 2020 album titled ''[[Chant: The Human & the Holy]]'', which centers on personal mantras and chants inspired by Rimes's mental health journeys. Rimes further developed her acting career during this period. She has since appeared in several feature and television films including ''[[Good Intentions (2010 film)|Good Intentions]]'' (2010), ''[[Reel Love]]'' (2011), and ''[[It's Christmas, Eve]]'' (2018). She also guest appeared in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Country Comfort (TV series)|Country Comfort]]'' (2021) as herself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRimes was born in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. She is the only child of Wilbur Rimes and Belinda Butler. The family moved to [[Garland, Texas]], when she was six. She was enrolled in vocal and dance classes, and was performing at local talent shows at the age of five.<ref name=\"allmusicbio\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p182450|pure_url=yes}}|title=LeAnn Rimes - Biography|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=February 14, 2009}}</ref> Rimes began her career in [[musical theatre]], performing in a [[Dallas, Texas]], production of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', and almost landing the lead part in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''. After appearing on the network television competition show ''[[Star Search]]'', where she clearly charmed host [[Ed McMahon]] in addition to being a one-week champion, Rimes decided to go into [[country music]]. Rimes appeared a number of times on ''Johnnie High's Country Music Revue'' in [[Arlington, Texas]], which gained the attention of national [[talent scouts]].\n\nBy age nine, Rimes was an experienced singer. She toured nationally with her father and also regularly performed [[a cappella]] renditions of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" at the opening of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] football games. Wilbur Rimes began recording his daughter under the independent label Nor Va Jak when she turned 11.
