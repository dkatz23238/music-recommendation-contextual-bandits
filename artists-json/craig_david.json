''[[Born to Do It]]'' was released in the United States on 17 July 2001, peaking at number 11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and sold over 1 million copies.

Although \"What's Your Flava?\" and \"[[Rise & Fall (Craig David song)|Rise & Fall]]\" (duet with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]) received airplay on the [[urban contemporary]] and [[Adult contemporary music#Soft adult contemporary|soft adult contemporary]] formats, they did not make the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart or the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart.

According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], ''Slicker Than Your Average'' was certified Gold in the U.S..\n\nDavid also commented that the album title could be looked at in two different ways: \"On the one hand, it's coming across like I'm arrogant.
