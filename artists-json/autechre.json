''Tri Repetae'' and its associated EPs were combined into a two disc set entitled ''Tri Repetae++'', which was released in the United States. An official promotional video was created for \"Second Bad Vilbel\" from ''Anvil Vapre'' by English visual artist [[Chris Cunningham]] (his first). The \"Second Bad Vilbel\" video featured rapidly cut shots of industrial machinery and robotic movement, synchronised with the music. Cunningham later re-edited the video in 2002, following his disappointment with the original: \"It was intended to be completely abstract but it didn't quite work out that way\".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://inverted-audio.com/visual/chris-cunningham-in-focus/ |title = Chris Cunningham: In Focus |access-date = 24 August 2014 |publisher = Inverted Audio }}</ref> A two track vinyl-only EP entitled ''[[We R Are Why]]'', was available to buy during certain concerts and via mail order during 1996.

''Radio Mix'' was also released in 1997; a rare CD-only promotional recording, it contains an hour-long DJ mix of other artists' tracks, some of them remixed by Autechre, as well as a short interview edited sometimes to the point of incomprehensibility.\n\nAn untitled record (typically known as ''[[LP5]]'' or simply ''Autechre'') followed in 1998.

The title track from ''Gantz Graf'' inspired an iconic video by British designer [[Alex Rutterford]], featuring an object (or an agglomeration of objects) synchronised to the music as it morphs, pulsates, shakes, and finally dissolves. Rutterford, who had previously created an unofficial video for the ''Tri Repetae'' track \"Eutow\" as part of the [[Channel 4]] music programme ''Lo-Fi'' in 2001, claimed the idea for the \"Gantz Graf\" video came during one of his [[LSD]] trips.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://warp.net/records/autechre/alex-rutterford-on-the-creation-of-the-gantz-graf-video |title=Warp / Records / Autechre / Alex Rutterford on the Creation of the Gantz Graf Video |website=Warp.net |access-date=2 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Peel Session 2|second]] Autechre Peel session EP was also released in 2002, containing four tracks broadcast in 1999, named by John Peel himself.

Its final track, \"Sublimit\", is at almost sixteen minutes; Autechre's longest composition to feature on any of their albums until 2016's [[elseq 1-5]].

The duo's roots in [[graffiti|tagging]], early [[hip-hop]] and [[electro music]], and [[b-boy]] culture in general are still evident, with many reviews noting hip-hop rhythms\u2014sometimes heavily obscured or processed, and sometimes explicit even in later work. All of Autechre's live webcasts have featured large amounts of early hip-hop and electro.

The process, as Booth describes in a 2020 interview with the New York Times, involves one sending a track to another, which is sent back with revisions before it is deemed finished. Brown remarks that, although they \"behave differently, we sometimes try to achieve the same goal, but with greatly differing approaches (as) we really do get off on the fact that we\u2019re on the same page most of the time.\u201d<ref name=\"NYTimes\" />\n\n===Equipment=== \nAutechre use many different [[digital synthesizer|digital synths]] and a few [[analog synthesizer|analogue synths]] in their production,<ref name=\"SOS97\" /> as well as analogue and digital [[drum machines]], [[mixing console|mixers]], [[effects unit]]s and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]]. They have also made extensive use of a variety of computer based [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], [[software synthesiser]]s, and other applications as a means of controlling those synths and processing the synthesised sounds. Much of the hardware and software they use has been customised by the band themselves.<ref name=\"SOS97\" /> Autechre have also experimented in depth with development environments such as [[Max (software)|Max/MSP]],<ref name=\"SOS04\" /> and [[Kyma (sound design language)|Kyma]],<ref name=\"SOS04\" /> amongst others, from 1997 onwards.

According to the 2016 interview to [[Resident Advisor]], both members haven't bought a piece of equipment \"in the last 5 years\", making MAX/MSP a primary production method, with Sean Booth stating that \"in Max I can generally build the thing I need, and if I don't know how to do that it'll generally be worthwhile learning.\" Booth said that they use MAX as MIDI \"only handles a limited set of information\" and that instruments like the piano \"separates the artist from the string.\"<ref name=\"FrereJones\" />\n\n===Collaborations, remixes and covers===\nBoth Booth and Brown are known to have been heavily involved with the majority of releases by the mysterious [[Gescom]] collective, although Booth admitted in an interview that around 20-30 musicians overall are connected with what he describes as an \"umbrella project\". Three elaborately packaged albums (''\u00e6\u00b3o & h\u00b3\u00e6'', ''\u00e6o\u00b3 & \u00b3h\u00e6'', and ''ha\u00b3oe & ah\u00b3eo'') have been made by Autechre in collaboration with Andrew M. McKenzie's ongoing [[Hafler Trio]] project. These albums are significantly more minimal than any other Autechre release, featuring dense, claustrophobic and noisy [[drone music|drones]]. A track called \"Elephant Gear\", credited to both Autechre and Canadian [[breakcore]] musician [[Venetian Snares]] under the alias AEVSVS, was released on a compilation in tribute to [[Elektron (company)|Elektron]] co-founder Daniel Hansson, who died in a car accident. Autechre have collaborated with several artists for live performances, including [[Zoviet France]],<ref name=\"wir1\" /> [[Fennesz]] and [[Roedelius]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fm4v2.orf.at/static/misc/djs_list.htm|title=FM4|website=Fm4v2.orf.at|access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref> ''3. Telepathics Meh In-Sect Connection'', an album by Sean Booth in collaboration with Mika Vainio of [[Pan Sonic]] and [[Kouhei Matsunaga]], was released in early 2010.\n\nIn 2009 they contributed a cover of an [[LFO (British band)|LFO]] song to the ''[[Warp20 (Recreated)|Warp20]]'' compilation, as well as having their song \"Tilapia\" covered by [[John Callaghan (musician)|John Callaghan]].\n\nThe compilation CD ''The Only Blip Hop Record You Will Ever Need, Vol.1'', issued in 2002 by David Byrne's Luaka Bop Records, contains a cover version of \"Gnit\" performed by Marie + Scratch.  It is performed using only human voice samples.\n\nThe band [[Pink Freud]] has performed covers of several Autechre numbers, including [[Basscadet]], [[Chiastic Slide|Cichli]], and [[Bike (Autechre song)|Bike]].  These live performances are available on [[YouTube]].\n\nAutechre helped initiate the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] [[music festival]] in 2000, and curated the 2003 festival.\n\n===Radio===\nAutechre have been involved with radio since their early days, originally spinning for IBC Radio, a [[Manchester]] [[pirate radio]] station in 1991, where they had their own show playing Belgian techno alongside their own demos.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Autechre-Cavity-Job/release/81009 Cavity Job Discogs entry]\u2014''Cavity Job''</ref> Later they would appear as
