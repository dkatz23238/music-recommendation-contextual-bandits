The three subjects together were denoted by the word ''trivium'' during the [[Middle Ages]], but the tradition of first learning those three subjects was established in [[Education in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]]. Contemporary iterations have taken various forms, including those found in certain British and American universities (some being part of the [[Classical education movement]]) and at the independent [[Oundle School]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>See [http://www.martinrobinson.net/writing.html Martin Robinson, ''Trivium 21st century'']. Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at King's College London on the future of the liberal arts at schools and universities; see [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx] and [http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge Boarding Schools Association,''Oundle School - improving intellectual challenge''].</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nEtymologically, the Latin word '''trivium''' means \"the place where three roads meet\" (tri + via); hence, the subjects of the trivium are the foundation for the [[quadrivium]], the upper division of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] education in the [[liberal arts]], which consists of [[arithmetic]] (numbers as abstract concepts), [[geometry]] (numbers in space), [[music]] (numbers in time), and [[astronomy]] (numbers in space and time). Educationally, the trivium and the quadrivium imparted to the student the seven liberal arts of [[classical antiquity]].<ref name=\"english-ety\" />\n\n[[File:Priscianus della Robbia OPA Florence.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Allegory of Grammar.

This is the step where the student \"comes to terms,\" defining the objects and information perceived by the five senses. Hence, the [[Law of Identity]]: ''a tree is a tree, and not a cat''.\n\n'''[[Logic]]''' (also [[dialectic]]) is the \"mechanics\" of [[thought]] and of [[analysis]], the process of composing sound arguments and identifying [[Fallacy|fallacious arguments]] and statements and so systematically removing contradictions, thereby producing factual knowledge that can be trusted.\n\n'''[[Rhetoric]]''' is the application of language in order to instruct and to persuade the listener and the reader. It is the knowledge (grammar) now understood (logic) and being transmitted outwards as wisdom (rhetoric).\n\n[[Aristotle]] defined Rhetoric as, \"the power of perceiving in every thing that which is capable of producing persuasion.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=Thomas|title=The Rhetoric, Poetic and Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle|publisher=Robert Wilks|year=1811|location=London|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n[[Sister Miriam Joseph]], in ''The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric'' (2002), described the trivium as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Grammar is the art of inventing symbols and combining them to express thought; logic is the art of thinking; and rhetoric is the art of communicating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language to circumstance.\n\n'''. . .'''\n\nGrammar is concerned with the thing as-it-is-symbolized. Logic is concerned with the thing as-it-is-known. Rhetoric is concerned with the thing as-it-is-communicated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=Sister Miriam |title=The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric |publisher=Paul Dry Books |year=2002 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lg0a-RJcn4gC&pg=PA3 |pages=3, 9 |chapter=1, The Liberal Arts|isbn=9781589882737 }}</ref>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nJohn Ayto wrote in the ''Dictionary of Word Origins'' (1990) that study of the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) was requisite preparation for study of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). For the medieval student, the trivium was the curricular beginning of the acquisition of the seven [[liberal arts]]; as such, it was the principal undergraduate course of study. The word ''[[wikt:trivial|trivial]]'' arose from the contrast between the simpler trivium and the more difficult quadrivium.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ayto |first=John |title=Dictionary of Word Origins |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1990 |page=542 |isbn=1-55970-214-1}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Classical education movement]]\n* [[Quadrivium]]\n* [[The three Rs]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [[McLuhan, Marshall]] (2006).
