Since 2001, the band has consisted of [[Rivers Cuomo]] (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), [[Patrick Wilson (musician)|Patrick Wilson]] (drums, backing vocals), [[Scott Shriner]] (bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and [[Brian Bell]] (rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals).\n\nAfter signing to [[Geffen Records]] in 1993, Weezer released their self-titled debut album, also known as the [[Weezer (Blue Album)|Blue Album]], in May 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles \"[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]\", \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\", and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", the Blue Album became a [[multiplatinum]] success. Weezer's second album, ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved [[cult following|cult status]] and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and ''Pinkerton'' are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for ''Pinkerton'', the founding bassist [[Matt Sharp]] left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.\n\nIn 2001, Weezer returned with the [[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]] with their new bassist, [[Mikey Welsh]]. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"[[Hash Pipe]]\" and \"[[Island in the Sun (Weezer song)|Island in the Sun]]\", it was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left for health reasons and was replaced by Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'' (2002), achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]]'' (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"[[Beverly Hills (song)|Beverly Hills]]\" became Weezer's first single to top the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and their first to reach the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nIn 2008, Weezer released the [[Weezer (Red Album)|Red Album]]; its lead single, \"[[Pork and Beans (song)|Pork and Beans]]\", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a [[Grammy]]-winning music video.

In early 2002, well before the official release of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope also briefly shut down Weezer's audio/video download webpage, removing all the MP3 demos.\n\nIn April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money for cowriting several Weezer songs.

Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales were not as strong as those for the Green Album. Two singles were released from the album. The music video for \"[[Dope Nose]]\" featured an obscure [[B\u014ds\u014dzoku|Japanese motorcycle gang]], and was put into regular rotation. The music video for \"[[Keep Fishin']]\" combined Weezer with [[the Muppets]], and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.\n\nWeezer released its much-delayed first DVD on March 23, 2004. The ''[[Weezer \u2013 Video Capture Device: Treasures from the Vault 1991\u20132002|Video Capture Device]]'' DVD chronicles the band from its beginnings through ''[[Maladroit]]'''s Enlightenment Tour.
