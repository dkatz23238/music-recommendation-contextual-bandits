Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet:  [[Cennino Cennini]], in his 15th-century manual on painting, wrote, \"If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lac [red lake], ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder\"; he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue [[indigo]] and red [[hematite]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archetype.co.uk/our-titles/cennino-cenninis-i-il-libro-dellarte-i/?id=224|title=Cennino Cennini's Il libro dell'arte: a new English translation and commentary with Italian transcription|publisher=Archetype|year=2015|isbn=9781909492288|editor-last=Broecke|editor-first=Lara|location=London|pages=115|oclc=910400601|access-date=2018-11-23|archive-date=2020-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101102156/https://archetype.co.uk/our-titles/cennino-cenninis-i-il-libro-dellarte-i/?id=224|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn modern color theory, also known as the [[RGB color model]], red, green and blue are [[additive primary colors]]. Red, green and blue light combined makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This principle is used to generate colors on such as computer monitors and televisions.  For example, magenta on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using [[additive color]]s and light instead of pigment:  it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen. Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light.<ref name=\"huevaluechroma1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/041.php|title=The Dimensions of Colour: Part 4.

It has a vital role in the breakdown of the [[sugar]]s manufactured by chlorophyll. But in the fall, phosphate, along with the other chemicals and nutrients, moves out of the leaf into the [[Plant stem|stem]] of the plant. When this happens, the sugar-breakdown process changes, leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The brighter the light during this period, the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display. When the days of autumn are bright and cool, and the nights are chilly but not freezing, the brightest colorations usually develop.\n\nAnthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young [[leaf|leaves]] as they unfold from the [[bud]]s in early spring. They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[Red Delicious|red apples]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], [[cherry|cherries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[plum]]s.\n\nAnthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions, although in certain areas\u2014a [[autumn in New England|famous example being New England]]\u2014up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment.<ref name=\"tree1044\" /> In autumn forests they appear vivid in the [[maple]]s, [[oak]]s, [[sourwood]], [[Liquidambar|sweetgums]], [[dogwood]]s, [[tupelo]]s, [[cherry]] trees and [[persimmon]]s. These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical of many hardwood species.

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] it is also associated with [[pentecost]] and the Holy Spirit. Since 1295, it is the color worn by Cardinals, the senior clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. Red is the [[liturgical color]] for the feasts of martyrs, representing the blood of those who suffered death for their faith. It is sometimes used as the liturgical color for [[Holy Week]], including [[Palm Sunday]] and [[Good Friday]], although this is a modern (20th-century) development. In Catholic practice, it is also the liturgical color used to commemorate the Holy Spirit (for this reason it is worn at Pentecost and during Confirmation masses). Because of its association with martyrdom and the Spirit, it is also the color used to commemorate saints who were martyred, such as St. George and all the Apostles (except for the Apostle St. John, who was not martyred, where white is used). As such, it is used to commemorate bishops, who are the successors of the Apostles (for this reason, when funeral masses are held for bishops, cardinals, or popes, red is used instead of the white that would ordinarily be used).\n* In [[Buddhism]], red is one of the five colors which are said to have emanated from the [[Buddha]] when he attained enlightenment, or [[nirvana]]. It is particularly associated with the benefits of the practice of Buddhism; achievement, wisdom, virtue, fortune and dignity. It was also believed to have the power to resist evil. In China red was commonly used for the walls, pillars, and gates of temples.\n* In the [[Shinto]] religion of Japan, the gateways of temples, called [[torii]], are traditionally painted vermilion red and black. The torii symbolizes the passage from the profane world to a sacred place. The bridges in the gardens of Japanese temples are also painted red (and usually only temple bridges are red, not bridges in ordinary gardens), since they are also passages to sacred places.  Red was also considered a color which could expel evil and disease.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nItsukushima torii angle.jpg|A [[Shinto]] [[torii]] at [[Itsukushima]], Japan\nJohn Paul II funeral long shot.jpg|Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church at the funeral of Pope [[John Paul II]]\nDebating Monks.JPG|[[Buddhist]] monks in [[Tibet]]\nRavi Varma-Lakshmi.jpg|In [[Hinduism]], red is associated with [[Lakshmi]], the goddess of wealth and embodiment of beauty.\nMuharram in cities and villages of Iran-342 16 (160).jpg|Red flags in a celebration of [[Muharram]] in [[Iran]].\n</gallery>\n\n\n== Military uses ==\n=== The red uniform ===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2021}}\nThe red military uniform was adopted by the English Parliament's [[New Model Army]] in 1645, and was still worn as a dress uniform by the British Army until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.

Along with [[blue]], red is the most commonly used non-white color in sports. Numerous national sports teams wear red, often through association with their national flags. A few of these teams feature the color as part of their nickname such as Spain (with their [[association football]] (soccer) national team nicknamed ''La Furia Roja'' or \"The Red Fury\") and Belgium (whose [[Belgium national football team|football team]] bears the nickname ''Rode Duivels'' or \"Red Devils\").\n\nIn club [[association football]] (soccer), red is a commonly used color throughout the world. A number of teams' nicknames feature the color. A red [[penalty card]] is issued to a player who commits a serious infraction: the player is immediately disqualified from further play and his team must continue with one fewer player for the game's duration.\n\n[[Rosso Corsa]] is the red international motor racing color of cars entered by teams from Italy. Since the 1920s Italian race cars of [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Maserati]], [[Lancia]], and later [[Ferrari]] and [[Abarth]] have been painted with a color known as ''rosso corsa'' (\"racing red\"). National colors were mostly replaced in [[Formula One]] by commercial sponsor liveries in 1968, but unlike most other teams, Ferrari always kept the traditional red, although the shade of the color varies.\n\nThe color is commonly used for professional sports teams in Canada and the United States with eleven [[Major League Baseball]] teams, eleven [[National Hockey League]] teams, seven [[National Football League]] teams and eleven [[National Basketball Association]] teams prominently featuring some shade of the color. The color is also featured in the league logos of Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Basketball Association.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3533300.ece|title=Teams with red shirts have a head start|last=Dart|first=Tom|date=Mar 12, 2008|work=Times Online|access-date=Apr 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133533/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3533300.ece|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=dead|publisher=News International Group|location=London}}</ref> In the National Football League, a red flag is thrown by the head coach to challenge a referee's decision during the game.
