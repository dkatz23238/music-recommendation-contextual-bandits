This happened to us and Layne's family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we're okay with it, why can't you be? This happened to us, this didn't happen to you. But this album isn't about that, it's a bigger universal point. We're all going to fucking die, we're all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I've won.\"<ref name=\"Classic Rock 2009\"/> \"Sometimes people ask us, 'Wouldn't Layne have been pissed off that we did this?' And I tell them it would have been the opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We're not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I'm doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off.\"<ref name=\"Guitar World 2013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-jerry-cantrell-discusses-alice-chains-2009-comeback-black-gives-way-blue|title=Interview: Jerry Cantrell Discusses Alice in Chain's 2009 Comeback, 'Black Gives Way to Blue'|work=Guitar World|date=January 10, 2013|access-date=July 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702094006/http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-jerry-cantrell-discusses-alice-chains-2009-comeback-black-gives-way-blue|archive-date=July 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> And Cantrell added: \"We've toured around the world, we've lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can't fucking replace, and then we've chosen by circumstance to get together again.
