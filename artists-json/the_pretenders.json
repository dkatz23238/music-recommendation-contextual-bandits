Hill was impressed and arranged a day at Studio 51 to record another demo. Although it was rough, he felt he had seen and heard enough \"star potential\" to suggest that Hynde form a more permanent band to record for his new label, Real Records.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Hynde then formed a band composed of Pete Farndon on bass, James Honeyman-Scott on guitar, and Gerry Mcilduff on drums. This band, then without a name, recorded five tracks at Regents Park Studio in July 1978, including a cover of The Kinks' song \"Stop Your Sobbing\". Shortly thereafter, Gerry Mcilduff was replaced on drums by Martin Chambers. Hynde named the band \"Pretenders\" after [[the Platters]] song \"[[The Great Pretender]]\",<ref>Deanna R.

Two days later, on 16 June 1982, Honeyman-Scott died of heart failure as a result of cocaine intolerance. Farndon was in the midst of forming a new band when he was found dead on 14 April 1983 by his wife.

During July 1982, a caretaker team of Hynde, Chambers, [[Rockpile]] guitarist [[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]], and [[Big Country]] bassist [[Tony Butler (musician)|Tony Butler]] was assembled to record the single \"Back on the Chain Gang\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buskin |first1=Richard |title=CLASSIC TRACKS: The Pretenders 'Back On The Chain Gang' Producer: Chris Thomas \u2022 Engineer: Steve Churchyard |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-pretenders-back-chain-gang |website=Sound on Sound |publisher=SOS Publications Group and/or its licensors |access-date=17 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422034825/https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-pretenders-back-chain-gang |archive-date=22 April 2019  |date=5 September 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The song was released in October and became their biggest success in the US, staying at No.&nbsp;5 for three consecutive weeks.

The US B-side, \"2000 Miles\", was released as a single in the UK. The third Pretenders album, ''[[Learning to Crawl]]'' was produced by \"fifth Pretender\" Chris Thomas and released in January 1984.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nIn July 1985, the band (including Rupert Black on keyboards) played at [[Live Aid]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Soon after recording sessions for the next album began and one track had been completed, Hynde declared that Chambers was no longer playing well and dismissed him. Discouraged at the loss of his bandmate, Foster quit (\"My whole argument was that Martin Chambers was the rhythm section of the Pretenders and it didn't really matter who was playing bass. So I just said I didn't want to be involved any more.\"<ref name=\"fosterguitarist\">[http://www.simpleminds.org.uk/reallifereviews.html 'Come a Long Way'] \u2013 interview with Malcolm Foster by Michael Leonard \u2013 ''Guitarist'' magazine, September 1990</ref>) Hynde and McIntosh recorded the rest of the album in various sessions in New York City and Stockholm with assorted session musicians. Towards the end of the sessions, Hynde hired two of the guest players\u2013bassist [[T.M. Stevens]] and ex-[[Haircut One Hundred]] drummer [[Blair Cunningham]]\u2014as the new Pretenders rhythm section. The ''[[Get Close]]'' album was released in 1986; the disc included the top 10 singles, \"Don't Get Me Wrong\" from the film ''[[Gung Ho (film)|Gung Ho]]'' (helped by a popular video homage to the television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|the Avengers]]'') and \"Hymn to Her\", a No.&nbsp;8 success in the UK.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>  In the US, both \"Don't Get Me Wrong\" and \"My Baby\" reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pretender to the Throne|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=65|date=29 May 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65|access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n\nFor the ''Get Close'' tour, Bernie Worrell was added to the live lineup on keyboards. During the tour, Hynde felt the band's sound had strayed from its new wave rock roots. She believed that she was now fronting a new band that was \"not Pretenders\". Partway into the tour, she took drastic action: Stevens and Worrell were both sacked, Malcolm Foster was reinstated on bass, and Rupert Black returned on keyboards.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, Hynde hired session players (including one-time Pretenders Bremner and Cunningham and bassist John Mckenzie) and recorded a new Pretenders album, ''[[Packed!]]'' Hynde was the only person pictured anywhere on the album, and was the only official member of the band.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nBy 1993, Hynde had teamed with ex-[[Katydids (band)|Katydids]] guitarist [[Adam Seymour (musician)|Adam Seymour]] to form a new version of Pretenders. The team of Hynde and Seymour then hired a number of session musicians to record ''[[Last of the Independents]]'' that year, including ex-Smiths bassist [[Andy Rourke]], ex-[[The Primitives|Primitives]] bassist Andy Hobson, and former Pretender and drummer/writer/producer James Hood, previously with [[the Impossible Dreamers]] and [[Moodswings (band)|Moodswings]]. But by the end of the album sessions (and for the subsequent tour) the official band line-up was Hynde, Seymour, Hobson, and returning drummer Martin Chambers.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nWhen ''Last of the Independents'' was released in 1994, it rated gold in the US. Lead single \"Night In My Veins\" was a minor success in the US, a mid-chart success in the UK, and a top 10 success in Canada. The second single was the album's centrepiece ballad \"I'll Stand by You\"; this track received substantial airplay, and was a top 10 success in the UK, and top 20 in the US (No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100) and in Canada.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nOn 10 April 1999, Hynde led the memorial concert \"[[Concert for Linda|Here, There and Everywhere \u2013 A Concert for Linda]]\" for her late close friend Linda McCartney at the Royal Albert Hall, London, organised by Hynde and Carla Lane.
