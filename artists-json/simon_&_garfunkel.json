They were one of the best-selling music groups of the 1960s, and their biggest hits\u2014including \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" (1966),<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/sound-silence-surprise-hit-180957672/ | title=How \"The Sound of Silence\" Became a Surprise Hit }}</ref> \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\" (1968), \"[[The Boxer]]\" (1969), and \"[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]\" (1970)\u2014reached number one on singles charts worldwide.\n\nSimon and Garfunkel met in elementary school in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]], in 1953, where they learned to [[harmonize]] and began writing songs. As teenagers, under the name Tom & Jerry, they had minor success with \"Hey Schoolgirl\" (1957), a song imitating their idols, the [[The Everly Brothers|Everly Brothers]]. In 1963, aware of a growing public interest in folk music, they regrouped and were signed to [[Columbia Records]] as Simon & Garfunkel. Their debut, ''[[Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.]],'' sold poorly; Simon returned to a solo career, this time in England. In June 1965, a new version of \"The Sound of Silence\" [[Overdubbing|overdubbed]] with electric [[guitar]] and drums became a US [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] hit, reaching number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The duo reunited to release a second studio album, ''[[Sounds of Silence]],'' and tour colleges nationwide. On their third release, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'' (1966), they assumed more creative control. Their music was featured in the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', giving them further exposure. Their next album ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'' (1968) topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bookends-mw0000043634/awards |title=Simon & Garfunkel, ''Bookends'' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Allmusic |access-date=August 22, 2015 }}</ref> and included the number-one single \"Mrs. Robinson\" from the film.\n\nSimon and Garfunkel had a troubled relationship, leading to artistic disagreements and their breakup in 1970. Their final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'', was released that January, becoming [[List of best-selling albums|one of the world's best-selling albums]].
