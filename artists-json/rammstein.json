The band's lineup\u2014consisting of lead vocalist [[Till Lindemann]], lead guitarist [[Richard Kruspe]], rhythm guitarist [[Paul Landers]], bassist [[Oliver Riedel]], drummer [[Christoph Schneider]], and keyboardist [[Christian Lorenz|Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz]]\u2014has remained unchanged throughout their history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the [[punk rock]] acts [[Feeling B]] and [[First Arsch]].\n\nAfter winning a local contest, Rammstein was able to record [[Demo (music)|demos]] and send them to different record labels, eventually signing with [[Motor Music]]. Working with producer [[Jacob Hellner]], they released their debut album ''[[Herzeleid]]'' in 1995. Though the album initially sold poorly, the band gained popularity through their live performances and the album eventually reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second album, ''[[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]]'', was released in 1997 and debuted at No. 1 in Germany, resulting in a worldwide tour lasting nearly four years and spawning the successful singles \"[[Engel (song)|Engel]]\" and \"[[Du hast]]\" and the live album ''[[Live aus Berlin]]'' (1999). Following the tour, Rammstein signed with major label [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] and released ''[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]'' in 2001. Six singles were released from the album, all charting in countries throughout Europe. The lead single, \"[[Sonne (Rammstein song)|Sonne]]\", reached No. 2 in Germany. Rammstein released ''[[Reise, Reise]]'' in 2004 and had two more singles reach No. 2 in Germany: \"[[Mein Teil]]\" and \"[[Amerika (song)|Amerika]]\"; the former song reached No. 1 in Spain, becoming their first No. 1 single.\n\nTheir fifth album, ''[[Rosenrot]]'', was released in 2005, and the lead single, \"[[Benzin]]\", reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second live album, ''[[V\u00f6lkerball]]'', was released in 2006. The band released their sixth album, ''[[Liebe ist f\u00fcr alle da]]'', in 2009, with its lead single, \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", becoming their first No. 1 hit in Germany despite having a controversial music video that featured [[hardcore pornography]]. The band then entered a recording hiatus and toured for several years, releasing the ''[[Made in Germany 1995\u20132011|Made in Germany]]'' greatest hits album as well as the ''[[Rammstein in Amerika]]'' and ''[[Rammstein: Paris|Paris]]'' live albums. After a decade without new music, Rammstein returned in 2019 with the song \"[[Deutschland (song)|Deutschland]]\", which became their second No. 1 hit in Germany. Their [[Untitled Rammstein album|untitled seventh studio album]] was released in May 2019 and reached No. 1 in 14 countries. While sheltering during [[COVID-19 pandemic in Germany|COVID-19]] [[COVID-19 lockdowns|lockdown]]s, the band spontaneously wrote and recorded their eighth studio album, ''[[Zeit (Rammstein album)|Zeit]]'', which was released in April 2022.\n\nRammstein was one of the first bands to emerge within the [[Neue Deutsche H\u00e4rte]] genre, with their debut album leading the music press to coin the term, and their style of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band has been very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature [[pyrotechnics]], have contributed to the growth in their popularity. Despite success, the band has been subject to some controversies, with their overall image having been criticized; for instance, the song \"[[Ich tu dir weh]]\" forced its parent album ''Liebe ist f\u00fcr alle da'' to be re-released in Germany with the song removed due to its sexually explicit lyrics.\n\n==History==\n===Founding and ''Herzeleid'' (1989\u20131996)===\n{{Main|Herzeleid}}\n[[File:Rammstein logos joined.svg|thumb|Rammstein have used their logo since the release of ''[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]'' in 2001 and their typeface since the start of their discography.]]\n{{quote box|width=23em|\"I don't want to be another KISS, where people talk about makeup and stuff like that and no one talks about the music.\"|salign=right|source=\u2014Richard Kruspe<ref name=liberal>{{cite web|last1=Kruspe|first1=Richard Z.|title=Rammstein Guitarist: \"I Don't Want to be Another KISS.\"|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2018/12/18/rammstein-guitarist-i-dont-want-to-be-another-kiss/|website=www.metalsucks.net|date=18 December 2018|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref>}}\nIn 1989, [[East German]] guitarist [[Richard Kruspe]] escaped to [[West Berlin]] and started the band Orgasm Death Gimmick. At that time, he was heavily influenced by US music, especially that of rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. After the [[Berlin Wall]] came down, he moved back home to [[Schwerin]], where [[Till Lindemann]] worked as a [[basket weaving|basket-weaver]] and played drums in the band [[First Arsch]] (loosely translated as \"First Arse\" or \"First Ass\"). At this time, Kruspe lived with [[Oliver Riedel]] of [[the Inchtabokatables]] and [[Christoph Schneider]] of Die Firma.\n\nIn 1992, Kruspe made his first trip to the United States with Till Lindemann and Oliver \"Ollie\" Riedel. He realized that he did not want to make US music and concentrated on creating a unique German sound. Kruspe, Riedel and Schneider started working together on a new project in 1993. Finding it difficult to write both music and lyrics, Kruspe persuaded Lindemann, whom he had overheard singing while he was working, to join the fledgling group.

According to the band, people started to refer to them as \"the band with the 'Ramstein song'\" and later as the \"Ramstein band\".<ref name=\"MHfeature\"/>\n\nRammstein co-existed with the members' previous projects for about a year and a half. Members would invest the money raised with Feeling B shows in Rammstein. They recorded their first songs in a building that had been [[Squatting|squatted]] by Feeling B frontman [[Aljoscha Rompe]].<ref name=\"MHfeature\"/> A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive access to a professional recording studio<ref name=\"MHfeature\"/> for a whole week. Kruspe, Riedel, Schneider, and Lindemann entered and won the contest with a 4-track demo tape with demo versions of songs from Herzeleid, written in English. This sparked Landers' attention, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo. To complete their sound, Rammstein attempted to recruit [[Christian Lorenz|Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz]], who had played with Landers in [[Feeling B]]. Though initially hesitant, Lorenz eventually agreed to join the band. Later, Rammstein were signed by [[Motor Music]].<ref name=\"MHfeature\"/>\n\nRammstein began to record their first studio album, ''[[Herzeleid]]'', in March 1995 with producer [[Jacob Hellner]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rammstein.com/_Voelkerball/Band/Timeline/T1995/ |title= Rammstein :: Band :: Timeline |access-date= 21 June 2008 |publisher= Rammstein.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080613205805/http://www.rammstein.com/_Voelkerball/Band/Timeline/T1995/ |archive-date= 13 June 2008}}</ref> They released their first single \"[[Du riechst so gut]]\" that August and released the album in September. Later that year, they toured with [[Clawfinger]]<ref name=\"MHfeature\"/> in Warsaw and Prague. Rammstein headlined a 17-show tour of Germany in December, which helped boost the band's popularity and establish them as a credible live act. They went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single titled \"[[Seemann (Rammstein song)|Seemann]]\" on 8 January. On 27 March 1996, Rammstein performed on [[MTV]]'s ''Hanging Out'' in London, their first performance in the UK. Their first major boost in popularity outside Germany came when [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]] chose two Rammstein songs, \"Heirate mich\" and \"[[Rammstein (song)|Rammstein]]\", during his work as music director for the [[David Lynch]] 1997 film ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]''.<ref name=\"MHfeature\"/> The soundtrack for the film was released in the U.S. in late 1996 and later throughout Europe in April 1997. In the middle of 1996, they headlined one tour of their own in small, sold-out venues.<ref name=\"MHfeature\"/> Rammstein went on to tour through Germany, Austria, and Switzerland from September to October 1996, performing an anniversary concert on 27 September called \"100 years of Rammstein\".

This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named ''Engel \u2013 Fan Edition''. This contained two previously unreleased songs, \"Feuerr\u00e4der\" and \"Wilder Wein\". Release of the second single from the album ''Sehnsucht'' was \"[[Du hast]]\", which hit the German single charts August 1997 at No. 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer while ''Sehnsucht'' was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached No. 1 in Germany after two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, ''Herzeleid'' and both ''Sehnsucht'' singles (\"Du hast\" and \"Engel\") were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold-out shows throughout Europe in September and October. On 5 December 1997, they embarked on their first tour of the United States as the opening act for [[KMFDM]]. In July 1998, the band released a cover of the song [[Stripped (song)|Stripped]], originally released by Depeche Mode in early 1986; it was included on the tribute album ''[[For the Masses]]'', the Rammstein version obtained moderate success in Germany and Austria.\n\nOn 22\u201323 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band had played there up to that date.

Continuing their success in the US, ''Sehnsucht'' received Gold record status there on 2 November. The band was nominated at the [[MTV European Music Awards]] for ''Best Rock Act'' and performed \"Du hast\" live on 12 November that year.\n\nRammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for ''Best Metal Performance'' at the 41st-annual [[Grammy Awards]]. A year after it was filmed, the ''Live aus Berlin'' concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, ''Live aus Berlin'' went to No. 2 in the German Album Charts. On 13 September and 26 November 1999, the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively.

During December 2000, Rammstein released an MP3 version of \"[[Links 2-3-4]]\" as a teaser for their new album. 2001 was a busy year for Rammstein, as the band needed to finish off the Sehnsucht Tour ending in January and February with the band playing the [[Big Day Out]] festival in Australia and New Zealand and playing some concerts in Japan. January also heralded the shooting of the video for their upcoming single, \"[[Sonne (Rammstein song)|Sonne]]\", recorded in [[Potsdam]] at Babelsberger Filmstudios from 13 to 15 January 2001. The video was released on 29 January 2001.

In the same interview Richard Kruspe said: \"For me, ''Laibach'' is a very, very intellectual story. Rammstein is much more emotional for me \u2013 in the beginning. And I can\u2019t do anything with that intellect that ''Laibach'' uses.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK8EQqH1IM8&t=1552s ''Viva Jam: Rammstein''], Folge 176, 1997; abgerufen \u00fcber youtube.com am 26. Februar 2017</ref>\n\nUnlike many bands from Berlin in the early 1990s, Rammstein didn\u2019t want to imitate American or English bands. Flake Lorenz said in an interview: \"We found the style by knowing exactly what we didn\u2019t want. And we just didn\u2019t want to do American funky music or punk or anything we can\u2019t do. We realized that we can only do this music that we also play. And it\u2019s just very simple, dull, monotone.\"<ref name=\"ZDF\">Interview on ZDF with Rammstein from 199?, from ''Live aus Berlin'' (1999).</ref>\n\nRammstein's style has received positive feedback from critics. New Zealand's ''[[The Southland Times|Southland Times]]'' (17 December 1999) suggested that Till Lindemann's \"booming, sub-sonic voice\" would send \"the peasants fleeing into their barns and bolting their doors\", while ''[[The New York Times]]'' (9 January 2005) commented that on the stage, \"Mr. Lindemann gave off an air of such brute masculinity and barely contained violence that it seemed that he could have reached into the crowd, snatched up a fan, and bitten off his head\". [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] commented that \"their blend of industrial noise, grinding metal guitars, and operatic vocals is staggeringly powerful\".<ref name=\"Allmusic.com-sehnsucht\">{{cite web |title=SEHNSUCHT \u2013 Rammstein |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |website=[[AllMusic]] |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sehnsucht-mw0000031603 |access-date=10 July 2006}}</ref> \"We just push boundaries\", said Till Lindemann in an interview with rock magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'', \"We cannot help it if people don't like those boundaries being pushed\".\n\nNearly all of Rammstein's songs are in German. Educated in East German schools, the members were all taught Russian as a second language rather than English. In 2019, Flake commented: \"I saw a lot of East German bands that sung in very bad English to people who didn't understand English \u2013 it was absolutely stupid. But if you really want to tell your emotions, you have to speak in your mother tongue.\"<ref name=\"MHfeature\"/> Songs they have recorded entirely or partly in English include: a cover of [[Depeche Mode]]'s 1986 song \"[[Stripped (song)|Stripped]]\" and English renditions of \"Engel\", \"Du hast\", and \"Amerika\". The original version of \"Amerika\" as well as \"Stirb nicht vor mir (Don't Die Before I Do)\" and \"Pussy\" also contain some lyrics in English. The song \"[[Moskau (Rammstein song)|Moskau]]\" (\"Moscow\") contains a chorus in Russian, and Till Lindemann has an unofficial song called \"[[Shtil (Calm)|Schtiel]]\" (cover of song \"\u0428\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c\"(\"Shtil\") by Russian popular heavy metal band \"[[Aria (band)|Aria]]\") entirely in Russian.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news |title =''Sunday Herald Sun'', Melbourne, Australia |newspaper= Sunday Herald Sun}}</ref> \"[[Te quiero puta]]!\" is entirely in Spanish, \"Fr\u00fchling in Paris\" has a chorus in French, \"Zeig dich\" contains lyrics in Latin performed by a choir and \"Ausl\u00e4nder\" has lyrics in English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian. Oliver Riedel commented that \"[the] German language suits heavy metal music. French might be the language of love, but German is the language of anger\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> In an interview with Ultimate Guitar, when asked whether Rammstein would ever create an original song entirely in English, Till Lindemann stated that 'Rammstein will never write a song in English, it's like asking Buddha to kill a pig'.<ref name=\"Ultimate Guitar\">{{cite web |title= Till Lindemann: 'Rammstein Will Never Write a Song in English, It's Like Asking Buddha to Kill a Pig' |publisher= Ultimate Guitar |url= http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/till_lindemann_rammstein_will_never_write_a_song_in_english_its_like_asking_buddha_to_kill_a_pig.html |access-date= 22 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe band's lyrics, as sung by Till Lindemann, are an essential element of their music, and shape the perception by fans and a wider public. Among other things that are seen as controversial, Rammstein also refers to classical German literature, e.g. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's famous poems ''[[Der Erlk\u00f6nig]]'' (1778) and ''[[Heidenr\u00f6slein|Das Heidenr\u00f6slein]]'' (1771) for the songs \"Dalai Lama\" and \"Rosenrot\", respectively.<ref>''L\u00fcke'', L\u00fcke, Martina. \"Modern Classics: Reflections on Rammstein in the German Class\".

Also several of their songs are allegedly inspired by real-life events. These songs include \"Rammstein\" ([[Ramstein airshow disaster]]), \"Mein Teil\" ([[Armin Meiwes|The Meiwes Case]]), \"Wiener Blut\" ([[Fritzl case]]) and \"Donaukinder\" ([[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill]]).

The lyrics of the song \"[[Deutschland (song)|Deutschland]]\" contain the lines \"Deutschland! / Meine Liebe / kann ich dir nicht geben\" (Germany! / My love / [is what] I cannot give you), which conveys the band's inability to have unquestioned patriotic feelings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=genius.com |title=Rammstein \u2013 DEUTSCHLAND (English Translation) |url=https://genius.com/16826344 |website=Genius.com |access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Rammstein Nottingham.jpg|thumb|left|Rammstein are known for their frequent use of [[pyrotechnics]] during live performances.]]\n\nSince their early years,<ref name=\"MHfeature\"/> Rammstein are particularly known for their over-the-top live performances, making such extensive use of [[pyrotechnics]] that fans eventually coined the motto, \"Other bands play, Rammstein burns!\" (a play on [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]]'s song \"Kings of Metal\", which states that \"other bands play, Manowar kill\"). Following an accident in Berlin on 27 September 1996, in which some burning decorative parts of the stage collapsed,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://rammstein-europe.com/main.php?sekce=till-lindemann&l=en |title= Till Lindemann Biography |access-date= 10 May 2007 |publisher= Rammstein-Europe.com |archive-date= 1 July 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070701191646/http://www.rammstein-europe.com/main.php?sekce=till-lindemann&l=en |url-status= dead }}</ref> the band started using professionals to handle the pyrotechnics. Lindemann subsequently qualified as a licensed pyrotechnician, and often spends entire songs engulfed in flames. He has suffered multiple burns on his ears, head, and arms.\n\nThe band's stage costumes are also known for being outlandish. During the Reise, Reise Tour, they wore [[lederhosen]], [[corset]]s, and military-inspired uniforms with [[stahlhelm|German steel helmets]]; during the Mutter Tour, the group kept to the themes of the album artwork and descended onto the stage from a giant [[uterus]] while wearing diapers. During the ''V\u00f6lkerball'' concert, among others, Lindemann changed costumes between songs and dressed accordingly for each. For example, for the song \"Mein Teil\", he was dressed as a blood-soaked chef; in \"Reise, Reise\", he dressed as a sailor. The rest of the band each wore their own preferred costume, but none quite as bizarre as Till's. The band's flair for costumes is evident in their music videos as well as their live shows. In the \"Keine Lust\" video, all members except Lorenz are dressed in fat suits. In the \"Amerika\" video, all members of the band wear astronaut costumes.\n\nSince the Mutter Tour in 2001, Rammstein have worked with stage designer Roy Bennett, who helped the band in developing the look of the stages. With the Ahoi Tour in 2004/2005, the band began using a two-level stage, with half the band playing the lower level and the other half on the upper level. At this tour, the upper level rose over 2 meters above the stage floor and had an oval entrance just beneath the drums. At both sides of the upper level, a special lift made it possible for the band members to access both stage levels.\n\n[[File:Till-Lindemann.jpg|thumb|[[Till Lindemann]] performing \"[[Rammstein (song)|Rammstein]]\", during which he wears dual arm-mounted flamethrowers]]\n\nOn the [[Liebe ist f\u00fcr alle da Tour]] in 2009, the new stage still had a two-level design. This time, however, the upper level only had about half the height as on the previous tour. Stage entrance was possible by a hydraulic ramp in the middle of the stage floor. At each end of the upper level, stairs were placed in order to gain access to both levels. This tour included not only the extensive use of pyrotechnics, but also a massive lighting show, such as the band's logo lit up as big lamps on four enormous collapsible towers, forming the industrial backdrop of the set and being capable of different lighting effects.\n\nDuring the arena shows of the [[Made in Germany 1995-2011 Tour]], the stage was slightly altered with new set pieces such as a large industrial fan as well as new backdrops. The most noticeable addition was a long catwalk, connecting the main stage to a smaller stage in the middle of the audience. During the 2013 festival leg of the tour, the bridge and smaller stage were omitted. For the [[Rammstein Tour 2016|2016 Festival Tour]], the band kept the stage itself mostly unchanged, though had the entire lighting rig changed completely. According to Kruspe, the onstage antics are meant to get people's attention and have fun at the same time; Rammstein's motto, according to Schneider, is \"do your own thing and overdo it\".\n\nKruspe said of the stage show in July 1999, \"You have to understand that 99 per cent of the people don't understand the lyrics, so you have to come up with something to keep the drama in the show. We have to do something. We like to have a show; we like to play with fire. We do have a sense of humour. We do laugh about it; we have fun [...] but we're not [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]. We take the music and the lyrics seriously. It's a combination of humour, theatre, and our [[East German]] culture, you know?\"<ref>{{cite news |title=The Grand Rapids Press |date= 22 July 1999 |newspaper= Grand Rapids Press}}</ref>\n\nTheir antics have also garnered controversy. During the American [[Family Values Tour]] 1998, alongside acts such as rapper [[Ice Cube]], [[Korn]], and [[Limp Bizkit]], the band was arrested for [[public indecency]]. In one of their more infamous moments, Lindemann engaged in simulated [[sodomy]] with Lorenz during their performance of \"B\u00fcck dich\" in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].
