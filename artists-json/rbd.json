Herrera and Perroni were occupied with their television projects (the former with the TV series ''Terminales,'' and the latter as the protagonist of ''[[Cuidado con el \u00e1ngel|Cuidado Con El \u00c1ngel]]''). Ch\u00e1vez was in the middle of a tour with the musical ''[[Avenue Q]]'''s Mexican stage production, and was planning to build his career as a solo artist, actor and producer. Anah\u00ed managed her own clothing store in Mexico City and began an organization to help those who have [[eating disorder]]s. Dulce Mar\u00eda was involved with shooting a film ''Algui\u00e9n a visto a Lupita'' and a variety of projects, such as dubbing a cartoon character in a Mexican film. Later, Uckermann starred in the TV show ''Kdabra'', produced by [[Fox Networks Group|Fox]] in Colombia. On November 25, RBD released ''[[Best Of (RBD album)|Best Of]]'' (in Brazil: ''Hits Em Portugu\u00eas''; in the United States: ''Greatest Hits''), which was a CD/DVD that features their singles and a DVD with music videos as part of their goodbye.

An animated music video was released on December 3 on the group's YouTube channel.\n\n==Documentary about the group ==\nIn late 2012, Pedro Dami\u00e1n told Televisa that the group would return to the stage in 2013. According to Dami\u00e1n, the project was to do something amazing and interesting, \"Let's talk to them. Let's convince them to do something amazing, something interesting.\" He stated he was determined to revive the group and would be chatting with members and try to convince them to reunite. Following Dami\u00e1n's statements, Dulce Mar\u00eda said in an interview with Televisa that it was too early for a comeback; however, she did not rule out the possibility of ever doing a reunion with her former group members. \"I do not know about the future,\" she stated in the interview, \"but right now there's no way. Each of us are focused on his or her career. It's still very early. But never say never.\" Around the same time, in an interview for [[MTV]] Brasil, Christian Ch\u00e1vez said it was possible for a reunion in 2014, which was confirmed by Dami\u00e1n. On July 27, 2013, however, there was no official statement from Dulce Mar\u00eda, Herrera, Uckermann, Anah\u00ed, or Perroni of this occurring or a set date.\n\nWith resistance from some members, Dami\u00e1n decided to develop a documentary about the group in celebration of the sextet's 10 year anniversary. In an interview with Televisa, Dami\u00e1n said he will have something more concrete on the project later in the year, \"I have something like 800 hours of recordings&nbsp;...

The tour took place in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Spain, Slovenia, [[Serbia]], [[Dominican Republic]], Romania, the U.S. and many more countries in South America and Europe. RBD performed in Brazil for over 500,000 people, breaking the record by the Rolling Stones. In September, they did a series of concerts in Slovenia. The first concert was sold-out in 30 minutes, which broke records.

The cultural phenomenon led by the soap opera ''[[Rebelde (Mexican telenovela)|Rebelde]]'' and the pop group, accompanied by advertising strategies from 2004 to 2009, resulted in recognition from a young audience who followed the career of the group, leaving a legacy of six studio albums, two TV ''s''eries and multiple awards.<ref>{{cite news |title=RBD graba nueva serie en M\u00e9xico |url= http://www.peopleenespanol.com/article/rbd-graba-nueva-serie-en-mexico |access-date= February 13, 2014 |work=[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]] |date=October 25, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://los40.com/los40/2018/02/22/cinetv/1519311785_800799.html|title=El creador de 'Rebelde' trabaja en una nueva versi\u00f3n de la serie|last=LOS40|date=February 22, 2018|website=LOS40|language=es|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvynovelas.com/mx/tv-y-novelas/rbd-rebelde-5-mejores-canciones-telenovela/|title=Las 5 mejores canciones de RBD|date=September 23, 2018|website=TVyNovelas M\u00e9xico|language=es-MX|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elobservatodo.cl/noticia/sociedad/rbd-el-regreso-la-banda-prepara-su-reencuentro-luego-de-seis-anos|title=RBD el regreso, la banda prepara su reencuentro luego de seis a\u00f1os|website=El Observatodo.cl, Noticias de La Serena y Coquimbo|language=es|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref> On March 2, 2007, photos of Ch\u00e1vez marrying a Canadian BJ Murphy were leaked, and the singer spoke about this in a statement, officially coming out.

After the event concluded, a white van that was thought to contain the group was spotted leaving the area. Due to this, thousands of people ran in excitement and in the commotion, 43 people were injured and three others were killed. Later during their Celestial tour, the group spoke about the incident and stated \"It is something that struck us all. No one would tell us what happened until we were on our way back to Mexico, and to know that your fans were killed at your event is a horrible feeling because you think 'Wow, they were there to see me and because of that they\u2019re gone now' it\u2019s such an indescribable feeling and we can\u2019t explain how heartbroken we are\".
