After the band toured and recorded extensively during the late 1980s, culminating in the 1988\u20131990 [[New Jersey Tour]], Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora released successful solo albums in 1990 and 1991, respectively.\n\nIn 1992, the band returned with the double-platinum ''[[Keep the Faith]]''. This was followed by their biggest-selling and longest-charting single \"[[Always (Bon Jovi song)|Always]]\" (1994) and the album ''[[These Days (Bon Jovi album)|These Days]]'' (1995), which proved to be a bigger success in Europe than in the United States, producing four Top Ten singles in the United Kingdom. Following a second hiatus, their 2000 album ''[[Crush (Bon Jovi album)|Crush]]'', particularly the lead single, \"[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]\", successfully introduced the band to a younger audience, and the band considered this their comeback album. The band followed up with ''[[Bounce (Bon Jovi album)|Bounce]]'' in 2002.  The platinum albums ''[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi album)|Have a Nice Day]]'' (2005)  and ''[[Lost Highway (Bon Jovi album)|Lost Highway]]'' (2007) saw the band incorporate elements of country music into some of the songs, including the 2006 single \"[[Who Says You Can't Go Home]]\", which won the band a [[Grammy Award]] and became the first single by a rock band to reach No. 1 on the country charts. ''[[The Circle (Bon Jovi album)|The Circle]]'' (2009) marked a return to the band's rock sound. The band also enjoyed great success touring, with both the 2005\u20132006 [[Have a Nice Day Tour]] and 2007\u20132008 [[Lost Highway Tour]] ranking among the Top 20 [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of the 2000s. After recording and releasing ''[[Because We Can]]'' in 2013, lead guitarist [[Richie Sambora]] left the band just before an April concert during the [[Because We Can Tour|supporting tour]] to spend more time with his family. The band released their first studio album without Sambora, ''[[Burning Bridges (Bon Jovi album)|Burning Bridges]]'', in 2015 and the follow-up album ''[[This House Is Not for Sale|This House Is Not For Sale]]'' in 2016, [[This House Is Not for Sale Tour|the tour for which]] encompassed 2017\u20132019.

Biography\"/> The song was played by a local radio station on a compilation tape.<ref name=\"Jon Bon Jovi Biography\"/>\n\nBy mid-1982, out of school and working part-time at a women's shoe store, Jon Bon Jovi took a job at the [[Power Station (recording studio)|Power Station Studios]], a [[Manhattan]] recording facility where his cousin [[Tony Bongiovi]] was co-owner. Jon made several [[demo (music)|demos]]\u2014including one produced by [[Billy Squier]]\u2014and sent them to record companies, though failing to make an impact. His first professional recording was as lead vocals in \"R2-D2 We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\" which was part of the ''[[Christmas in the Stars]]'' album which his cousin co-produced.<ref name=\"Bon Jovi Bio\"/>\n\nIn 1983, Jon visited a local radio station [[WAPP 103.5FM \"The Apple\"]] in [[Lake Success, New York]], to write and sing the jingles for the station. He spoke with DJ Chip Hobart and to the promotion director, John Lassman, who suggested Jon let WAPP include the song \"[[Runaway (Bon Jovi song)|Runaway]]\" on the station's compilation album of local homegrown talent. Jon was reluctant, but eventually gave them the song, which he had re-recorded in 1982 (following a rough early recording in 1981) with local studio musicians whom he designated The All Star Review\u2014guitarist [[Tim Pierce]], keyboardist [[Roy Bittan]], drummer [[Frankie LaRocka]], and bassist [[Hugh McDonald (American musician)|Hugh McDonald]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bon-jovi-facts/|title=13 Facts You May Not Know About Bon Jovi}}</ref>\n\nThe song began to get airplay in the New York area, then other sister stations in major markets picked up the song. In March 1983, Bon Jovi called David Bryan, who in turn called bassist Alec John Such and an experienced drummer named [[Tico Torres]], both formerly of the band Phantom's Opera. Tapped to play lead guitar for a short tour supporting \"Runaway\" was Bon Jovi's friend and neighbor, [[Dave Sabo]] (\"The Snake\"), though he never officially joined the band.<ref>L.M Matin. Jon Bon Jovi: The Sinner and the Saint.: The New Unauthorised Biography. BookBaby, Aug 20, 2013; Chapter 4</ref> He and Jon promised each other that whoever made it first, would help out the other. Sabo later went on to form the group [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]]. Jon saw and was impressed with hometown guitarist Richie Sambora who was recommended by fellow bassist Alec John Such and drummer Tico Torres. Sambora had toured with [[Joe Cocker]], played with a group called [[Mercy (band)|Mercy]] and had been called up to audition for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. He also played on the album ''Lessons'', originally intended for release in 1982<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/Message-Lessons/master/956013 Message&nbsp;\u2014 ''Lessons'' @discogs.com] Retrieved 1-23-2018.</ref> with the band Message for which Alec John Such was the bassist. Message was originally signed to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[Swan Song Records]] label, although the album was never officially released at the time.<ref name=\"Bon Jovi Bio\"/> Meanwhile, WAPP, the station that had first played \"Runaway\" worked with WOR-TV (now WWOR-TV) in nearby Secaucus, NJ on a music video show, Rock 9 Videos, for a short time in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/01/on-the-30th-anniversary-of-bon-jovis-debut-we-track-down-the-guy-who-wrote-runaway/357110/|title=On the 30th Anniversary of Bon Jovi's Debut, We Track Down the Guy Who Wrote 'Runaway'|website=[[The Atlantic]]|date=January 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTico Torres was also an experienced musician, having recorded and played live with Phantom's Opera, [[The Marvelettes]], and [[Chuck Berry]]. He appeared on 26 records and had recently recorded with [[Franke and the Knockouts]], a Jersey band with hit singles during the early 1980s.\n\nDavid Bryan had quit the band that he and Bon Jovi had founded in order to study medicine. While in college, he realized that he wanted to pursue music full-time, and was accepted to [[Juilliard School]], a New York music school. When Bon Jovi called his friend and said that he was putting together a band, and a record deal looked likely, Bryan followed Bon Jovi's lead and gave up his studies.\n\n===''Bon Jovi'', ''7800\u00b0 Fahrenheit'', ''Slippery When Wet'' and ''New Jersey'' (1984\u20131989)===\n[[File:Gentle Giant.jpg|thumb|right|Derek Shulman, who signed Bon Jovi to their first record deal.]]\nOnce the band began playing showcases and opening for local talent, they caught the attention of record executive [[Derek Shulman]], who signed them to [[Mercury Records]] and who was part of the [[PolyGram]] company. Because Jon Bon Jovi wanted a group name, Pamela Maher, a friend of Richard Fischer and an employee of [[Doc McGhee]], suggested they call themselves Bon Jovi, following the example of the other famous two-word bands such as [[Van Halen]]. This name was chosen instead of the original idea of Johnny Electric. Pamela's suggestion of the name was met with little enthusiasm, but two years later they hit the charts under that name.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nWith the help of their new manager [[Doc McGhee]] they recorded the band's debut album, ''[[Bon Jovi (album)|Bon Jovi]]'', which was released on January 21, 1984. The album included the band's first hit single, \"[[Runaway (Bon Jovi song)|Runaway]]\", reaching the top forty on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album peaked at number forty-three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart. The group soon found itself opening for [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] in U.S. and for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] in Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1985, Bon Jovi's second album, ''[[7800\u00b0 Fahrenheit]]'', was released. The band released three singles: \"[[Only Lonely]]\", \"[[In and Out of Love (Bon Jovi song)|In and Out of Love]]\" and the ballad \"[[Silent Night (Bon Jovi song)|Silent Night]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/7800%C2%BA-fahrenheit/id927202862|title=7800\u00ba Fahrenheit Bon Jovi|website=[[iTunes]]|date=March 27, 1985 }}</ref> The album peaked at number thirty-seven on the ''Billboard'' 200 and was certified Gold by [[RIAA]].<ref name=\"Bon Jovi Bio\"/> While the album did not sell as well as the band had hoped, it allowed Bon Jovi to get out on the road touring again. In May 1985, Bon Jovi headlined venues in Japan and Europe. At the end of the European tour, the band began a six-month run of U.S. tour dates supporting [[Ratt]]. In the midst of that tour, they appeared at the Texas Jam and Castle Donington's [[Monsters of Rock]] concerts in England. The band also performed at the first [[Farm Aid]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p3734/charts-awards/billboard-albums|pure_url=yes}} |title=AllMusic (Bon Jovi charts & awards) Billboard albums }}</ref>\n\nAfter two moderately successful albums, the group changed its approach and hired professional songwriter [[Desmond Child]] as a collaborator. [[Bruce Fairbairn]] was chosen to produce and, in early 1986, Bon Jovi moved to Vancouver, Canada to spend six months recording a third album.

By the end of 1986, Bon Jovi were well into six months of headline dates in arenas across America. In August 1987, they headlined England's [[Monsters of Rock]] festival.

The band ended the year having headlined 130 shows in the \"Tour Without End\", grossing $28,400,000. Asked what this breakthrough to worldwide fame meant, Jon Bon Jovi said, \"Everything is bigger, and it moves twice as fast. You're recognized twice as often.

They visited more than 22 countries and performed more than 232 shows. On June 11, 1989, the band performed a homecoming concert at [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey; the venue was sold out. In August 1989, the band headed to the Soviet Union for the [[Moscow Music Peace Festival]].

By the end of the ''New Jersey'' tour, the band had 16 months of concerts under its belt. The bandmates were exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally. Following the final tour date in Mexico, and without any clear plans for their future, the members of the band simply went home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://melodic-hardrock.com/bios/bon-jovi/|title=Bon Jovi}}</ref> The band has since stated that there were few if any goodbyes between them.

Jon took on the management responsibilities himself by closing ranks and creating ''Bon Jovi Management''. In October 1991, the band went to a [[Caribbean island]] of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] to discuss plans for the future. They managed to resolve their differences by allowing each member to speak about his feelings without interruption from each other.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Upon resolving their issues, they headed back into the Vancouver Little Mountain studios with [[Bob Rock]] to work on the band's fifth album in January 1992.\n\nBon Jovi's fifth studio album ''[[Keep the Faith]]'' was released in November 1992, representing \"the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Bon Jovi\" and marking a change in the band's sound and image. The album turned away from heavy drums and wild guitar solos, but instead introduced a more mature sound of Bon Jovi and contained more serious lyrics. The media focused considerable attention on Jon Bon Jovi's hair. When Jon Bon Jovi cut his hair he made headlines on [[CNN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/jon-bon-jovi-vol-45-no-18/|title=Jon Bon Jovi|website=PEOPLE.com|language=en|date=6 May 1996|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref> To promote ''Keep The Faith'' they returned to their roots playing a few dates at the small New Jersey clubs where they had started their career. The band appeared on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' but that was different from the other episodes of MTV Unplugged series. The performance captures Bon Jovi in an intimate, \"in the round\" experience, performing acoustic and electric renditions of classic hits (Bon Jovi and non-Bon Jovi tracks) and new material from ''Keep the Faith''.

The first single from the album \"Always\" became Bon Jovi's highest selling single and stayed on top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for six months. In the UK, ''Cross Road'' became the best-selling album of 1994.

[[Hugh McDonald (American musician)|Hugh McDonald]] who was the bassist on \"Runaway,\" unofficially replaced Such as bassist. Jon Bon Jovi said, regarding the departure of Such: \"Of course it hurts. But I learned to accept and respect it. The fact that I'm a workaholic, studio in, studio out, stage on, stage off, want to be dealing with music day and night, doesn't mean everyone else has to adjust to that pace.

The album debuted at number one in UK and spent four consecutive weeks at the top position. The album also reached number one in Ireland, Germany, Australia, Japan and many other countries. The album's first single was the [[rhythm and blues]] influenced ballad \"[[This Ain't a Love Song]]\". With an exotic video filmed in Thailand, \"This Ain't a Love Song\" reached top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100, and was the only significant U.S. hit from the album, however, the album produced four UK top ten hits (\"This Aint A Love Song\", \"[[Something for the Pain]]\", \"[[Lie to Me (Bon Jovi song)|Lie to Me]]\" and \"[[These Days (Bon Jovi song)|These Days]]\"). That year the band earned a [[BRIT Award]] for best international band and also won a [[MTV Europe Music Award]] for Best Rock. It was followed by These Days Tour. In June 1995, Bon Jovi sold out three-nights at London's historical ''[[Wembley Stadium]]''.  The concerts were documented for ''Bon Jovi: [[Live From London (Bon Jovi)|Live From London]]''. Bon Jovi visited 43 countries and performed 126 shows on ''[[These Days Tour]]''.\n\nFollowing the overwhelming success of the ''These Days Tour'', the members of Bon Jovi went their separate ways. But unlike the period following the New Jersey tour, tainted with uncertainty, this hiatus was a conscious group decision. The members of Bon Jovi agreed to a self-imposed two-year sabbatical from the band.\n\n===''Crush'', ''Bounce'' and ''This Left Feels Right'' (1999\u20132003)===\nBon Jovi reunited in 1999 to record the song \"[[Real Life (Bon Jovi song)|Real Life]]\" for the movie ''[[EdTV]]''. David Bryan was recovering from an accident in which he nearly severed his finger.\n\nAfter a nearly four-year hiatus, during which several band members worked on independent projects, Bon Jovi regrouped to begin work on their next studio album. In June 2000, ''[[Crush (Bon Jovi album)|Crush]]'' was released as the band's seventh studio album and constituted something of a comeback. The first single \"[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]\" was noted as one of the group's most successful releases in a decade and most importantly, becoming a symbol of the band's longevity as they prevailed through many different changes in the mainstream rock scene with admirable success. \"It's My Life\" helped introduce them to a new, younger fan base. The band received two [[Grammy]] nominations for Best Rock Album ''Crush'' and Best Rock Performance by Duo/Group \"It's My Life\". The video for \"It's My Life\" won the [[My VH1 Music Awards]] for \"My Favorite Video\".\n\nBon Jovi played two sold-out concerts at London's historic [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on August 19\u201320, 2000, becoming the last concerts held at the legendary venue before its demolition. That year the band played to 1.1 million fans in 40 arena and stadium venues across North America, Europe and Japan. While on tour, Bon Jovi released a collection of live performances from throughout their career in an album titled ''[[One Wild Night Live 1985\u20132001]]''. This was Bon Jovi's first-ever live album. The songs were culled from archives of recorded material the band had been collecting from their earliest days on the road right through the current tour. The band sold out two homecoming concerts at New Jersey's [[Giants Stadium]] on July 27\u201328, 2001. The broadcast broke ratings records for the VH-1 network. At the end of the year Bon Jovi awarded for \"Hottest Live Show\" at the 2001 [[My VH1 Music Awards]].\n\nThe members of the band had anticipated a brief vacation before work would begin on the band's 8th studio album but on September 11 the world changed. Within days of the terrorist attacks, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora had filmed Public Service Announcements for the Red Cross, recorded \"America The Beautiful\" for the [[NFL]] and performed as part of the historic ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' live telethon. One month later, the band participated at two Monmouth County Alliance of Neighbors concerts in Red Bank, NJ to raise funds for the families close the band's hometowns, which were affected by the World Trade Center disaster. And on October 21, 2001, Bon Jovi performed at the monumental ''Concert For New York'' at [[Madison Square Garden]], raising relief funds and honoring those who worked to save lives during the attack.\n\nIn spring 2002, the group entered the studio to begin recording their eighth studio album. ''[[Bounce (Bon Jovi album)|Bounce]]'' was influenced by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], released on October 8, 2002. The album debuted at number two in both the U.S. and UK, but was the first album to sell less than 6 million units since their 1985 record ''[[7800\u00b0 Fahrenheit]]''. The band went on the Bounce Tour for the album, during which they made history as the last band to play at [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]] before it was torn down.\n\nFollowing the end of the Bounce Tour in August 2003, Bon Jovi embarked on a side project; originally intending to produce an album consisting of live acoustic performances, the band ended up rewriting, re-recording and reinventing 12 of their biggest hits in a new and much different light. Bon Jovi's <!--Please do not add \"ninth studio album\" this album is Bon Jovi's compilation album, not a studio album--> compilation album ''[[This Left Feels Right]]'' was released in November 2003.\n\nThe following year, the band released a box set titled ''[[100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong]]'', the title being a homage to Elvis Presley's ''[[50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong]]''. The set consisted of four CDs packed with 38 unreleased and 12 rare tracks, as well as a DVD. The box set marked the sales of 100 million Bon Jovi albums and also commemorated the 20th anniversary of the release of the band's first record in 1984. In November 2004, Bon Jovi was honored with the Award for Merit at the [[American Music Awards]].\n\n===''Have a Nice Day'' and ''Lost Highway'' (2005\u20132008)===\nThe band's ninth studio album, ''[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi album)|Have a Nice Day]]'', was released in September 2005.
