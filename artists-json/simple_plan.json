David Desrosiers (bass guitar, backing vocals) joined the band in early 2000 and departed in July 2020 due to [[sexual misconduct]] accusations.

In 2001 the band performed at Edgefest II in Toronto.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011122025430/http://chartattack.com/damn/2001/08/2711.cfm \"LIVE: Edgefest II in Toronto\"]. ''Chart Attack'', 27 August 2001. Review By Keith Carman</ref>\n\nThe origin of the band's name is obscure. Band members have given various responses, including that the band was their \"simple plan to avoid working at [[McDonald's]]\" or other fast food restaurant chains. However, the name may be derived from the [[A Simple Plan (film)|1998 film]] and [[A Simple Plan (novel)|novel]] of the same name.<ref name=\"Rock Louder Interview with Simple Plan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklouder.co.uk/news/article/Interview-Simple-Plan.html|title=Rock Louder Interview with Simple Plan|publisher=Rocklouder.co.uk|access-date=21 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2002\u20132003: ''No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls''===\nIn 2002, Simple Plan released their debut studio album, ''[[No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls]]'', which featured the singles \"[[I'm Just a Kid]]\", \"[[I'd Do Anything (Simple Plan song)|I'd Do Anything]]\", \"[[Addicted (Simple Plan song)|Addicted]]\", and \"[[Perfect (Simple Plan song)|Perfect]]\". The band was aiming for a pure pop punk record.<ref name=\"Archived Simple Plan Bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.simpleplan.com/band.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029101135/http://www.simpleplan.com/band.php |archive-date=29 October 2005 |title=Archived Simple Plan Bio |date=29 October 2005 |access-date=21 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe record was originally released in the United States with 12 tracks, ending with \"Perfect\". Enhanced and foreign editions came in several different versions with up to two additional tracks in addition to the original 12. Two pop punk singers contributed on vocals:\n\n\"I'd Do Anything\" included vocals by [[Mark Hoppus]] from [[Blink-182]], and \"You Don't Mean Anything\" included vocals by [[Joel Madden]] from [[Good Charlotte]].\n\nThe years of 2002 and 2003 were very formative for the band. MTV Networks featured \"Addicted\" on one of their top performing shows during the spring of 2003 in the United States and internationally; on MTV and MTVu, and was filmed at the University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo) in Western New York. ''[[Addicted (Simple Plan song)|Addicted]]'' was the theme song for ''[[Fraternity Life]]''. While the show was taken off the air the following season the band continued to rise on the billboard charts in the United States and performances continued to be booked and reruns of the show played around the world.\n\nIn 2002, the band also performed and recorded the theme song for a rebooted installment of the [[Scooby-Doo]] franchise, ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]''. This show used the band's intro throughout its entire run until its conclusion in 2006. It also featured many of the band's songs within episodes of the show, including [[I'd Do Anything (Simple Plan song)|\"I'd Do Anything\"]].\n\nIn 2003, the band played as a headliner on the [[Vans Warped Tour]]&nbsp;\u2014 an appearance memorialized in the comedy slasher film, ''Punk Rock Holocaust'', in which four of the five band members are killed. The band also played short stints on the Warped Tour in 2004 and 2005. That same year (2003) the band opened for [[Avril Lavigne]] on her \"Try To Shut Me Up\" Tour.<ref name=\"Delafont Bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.delafont.com/music_acts/simple-plan.htm|title=Delafont bio|publisher=Delafont.com |access-date=21 February 2011}}</ref> In addition to several headlining tours, the band has also opened for [[Green Day]] and [[Good Charlotte]].<ref name=\"Delafont Bio\"/> The album had sold one million copies in early 2003 then went on to sell over four million copies worldwide, making it the band's best selling album to date.\n\n===2004\u20132006: ''Still Not Getting Any...''===\nIn 2004, Simple Plan released its second album, ''[[Still Not Getting Any...]]'' which was produced by [[Bob Rock]] and led to the subsequent singles, \"[[Welcome to My Life]]\", \"[[Shut Up! (Simple Plan song)|Shut Up]]\", \"[[Untitled (How Could This Happen to Me?)]]\", \"[[Crazy (Simple Plan song)|Crazy]]\", and (in some markets) \"Perfect World\".\n\nAccording to the album's bonus DVD, the band originally considered other names for it like ''Get Rich or Die Trying'', ''Enema of the State'', and ''In The Zone'' before deciding on ''Still Not Getting Any...''. The name stemmed from the band's belief that they were not getting any good reviews, with Bouvier once noting that the band only had one recent good review in ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]''. ''Still Not Getting Any...'' was a musical departure from the group's previous album: the band retained its style of downbeat lyrics matched to upbeat music, but managed to transcend from the standard pop punk genre. Although many of the tracks on this CD still carried the feeling of teen angst that is probably most noticeable in \"I'm Just a Kid\" from ''No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls'', the general slant of this album tends toward slightly deeper and more mature lyrical themes, as well as a more mainstream sound that edges away from the pure pop punk style of the group's last album. Some critics have pointed towards the inclusion of \"classic\" or \"mainstream\" rock elements, claiming the album \"de-emphasizes punk-pop hyperactivity in favor of straightforward, well-crafted modern rock\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/still-not-getting-any-mw0000469791 | title= Simple Plan : Still Not Getting Any... | first=Johnny | last=Loftus | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, their cover version of [[Cheap Trick]]'s \"[[Surrender (Cheap Trick song)|Surrender]]\" was featured in [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)#Soundtrack|the soundtrack album]] for the [[superhero film]], ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]''.\n \nLyrics from \"[[Welcome to My Life]]\" are featured in edition 97 of the [[xkcd]] webcomic ''A Simple Plan''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://xkcd.com/97 | title= xkcd A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language : A Simple Plan | access-date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2006\u20132009: ''Simple Plan''===\n[[File:Simpleplantrenton.jpg|right|thumb|The band in concert in [[Trenton, NJ]], December 2007]]\n[[File:Sposaka.JPG|right|thumb|Simple Plan in [[Osaka, Japan|Osaka]] in 2009. From left to right: [[Chuck Comeau]], Jeff Stinco, [[Pierre Bouvier]], [[S\u00e9bastien Lefebvre]], and David Desrosiers ]]\nAfter nearly a year and a half in support of ''Still Not Getting Any...'', the band ended most touring in February 2006. They were playing only a few shows, taking some time off, and beginning work on the third studio album. Bouvier headed to [[Miami]] as on about 21 March 2007 to work with [[Dave Fortman]]. The band entered the studio for pre-production in [[Los Angeles]] on 29 June. On 15 July the band returned to [[Montr\u00e9al]] to record at Studio Piccolo, the same studio in which the band had recorded ''Still Not Getting Any...''. The band finished recording and headed back to Miami and Los Angeles to mix the album. The final part of making the record was done in [[New York City]], and it was officially completed on 21 October.\n\n''[[When I'm Gone (Simple Plan song)|When I'm Gone]]'', the first single from ''[[Simple Plan (album)|Simple Plan]]'', was released on 29 October. This album was produced by both Dave Fortman and [[Max Martin]]. On 17 February 2008, the band achieved its highest charting single in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] After the first two albums just missed the UK top 40, \"When I'm Gone\" gave the band its best chart position in the UK, coming in at number 26.\n\nSimple Plan held an extensive tour schedule in support of the album. After completing an around-the-world promotional tour, they played several holiday shows during December 2007. After they continued promotional tours in January, Simple Plan played a triple bill in [[Camden Town]], London on 27 January 2008, with the first show featuring songs from the band's first CD, the second from the second, and the third from the new release. The band played four U.S. shows in late February, and completed a European tour running until late April. The band played four Japan dates, followed by several European festivals and headlining dates. On 1 July 2008, the band gave a free concert on [[Qu\u00e9bec City]]'s [[Plains of Abraham]], attracting a crowd of 150,000 people to the [[Canada Day]] show.<ref name=smallcrowd>{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberpresse.ca%2Farticle%2F20080702%2FCPSOLEIL%2F80701157%2F6585%2FCPSOLEIL02&hl=en&ie=UTF8&sl=fr&tl=en|title=Simple Plan rel\u00e8ve le d\u00e9fi|work=Le Soleil}}</ref> After a return to the Far East in late July and early August, the band played a Cross Canada Tour<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpleplan.com/tour.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040721213834/http://www.simpleplan.com/tour.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 July 2004|title=Simple Plan tour|publisher=Simpleplan.com|access-date=21 February 2011}}</ref> with [[Faber Drive]], [[Cute is What We Aim For]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Scotiabank-Place-875662.html |title=Support Acts Added to Simple Plan's August&nbsp;28 Performance at Scotiabank Place |publisher=Marketwire.com |access-date=27 November 2008}}</ref> and [[Metro Station (band)|Metro Station]].
