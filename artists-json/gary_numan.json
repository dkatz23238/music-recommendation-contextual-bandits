He entered the music industry as frontman of the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Tubeway Army]]. After releasing two albums with the band, he released his debut solo album ''[[The Pleasure Principle (album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' in 1979, topping the [[UK Albums Chart]].

He has sold over 10 million records.\n\nNuman faced intense hostility from critics and fellow musicians in his early career, but has since come to be regarded as a pioneer of [[electronic music]]. He developed a signature sound consisting of heavy synthesiser [[Hook (music)|hooks]] fed through guitar [[Effects unit|effects pedals]], and is also known for his distinctive voice and [[Androgyny|androgynous]] \"android\" persona. In 2017, he received an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]], the Inspiration Award, from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]].\n\n==Early life==\nGary Anthony James Webb<ref name=RG2003/> was born on 8 March 1958 in [[Hammersmith|Hammersmith, London]].

The decision to retire would be short-lived.{{Cn|date=January 2022}}\n\nDeparting from the pure [[electropop]] that he had been associated with, Numan began experimenting with [[jazz]], [[funk]], and ethereal, rhythmic pop. His first album after his 1981 farewell concerts was ''[[Dance (Gary Numan album)|Dance]]'' (1981). The album charted at No.&nbsp;3 on the [[UK Albums Chart|UK charts]], with an eight-week chart run and produced one hit single (\"[[She's Got Claws]]\"), which reached No.&nbsp;6.<ref name=\"NumanUKChartsOverview\" /> The album featured several distinguished guest players; [[Mick Karn]] (bass guitar; saxophone) and Rob Dean (guitar) of [[Japan (band)|Japan]], [[Roger Mason (musician)|Roger Mason]] (keyboards) of [[Models (band)|Models]], and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums) of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name=\"Discogs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Gary-Numan-Dance/release/1212792|title=Gary Numan - Dance (Vinyl, LP, Album)|publisher=Discogs.com|access-date=14 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith his former backing band, Chris Payne (keyboards; viola), Russell Bell (guitar), and Ced Sharpley (drums) now reformed as [[Dramatis]], Numan contributed vocals to the minor hit \"[[Love Needs No Disguise]]\" from the album ''[[For Future Reference]]''<ref name=\"DiscogsLoveNeedsNoDisguise\">{{cite web |title=Gary Numan and Dramatis - Love Needs No Disguise (1981, Vinyl) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Gary-Numan-And-Dramatis-Love-Needs-No-Disguise/release/55494 |website=Discogs |access-date=15 December 2020}}</ref> and lent vocals to the first single released by his long-term bassist [[Paul Gardiner]], \"[[Stormtrooper in Drag]]\", which also made the charts.<ref name=\"StormtrooperUKCharts\">{{cite web |title=Stormtrooper in Drag |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/stormtrooper-in-drag/ |website=Official Charts |publisher=Official UK Charts Company |access-date=15 December 2020}}</ref> However, Numan's career had begun to experience a gradual decline, and he was eclipsed commercially by former support act [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], as well as by [[the Human League]], [[Duran Duran]], and [[Depeche Mode]]. Each album also saw a new \"image\", none of which captured the public's imagination to nearly the same extent as the lonely android of 1979.<ref name=Lester />\n\nThe album ''[[I, Assassin]]'' (1982) fared less well than ''Dance''. Despite producing the top 10 hit \"[[We Take Mystery (To Bed)]]\" and two top 20 singles, the album peaked at No.&nbsp;8 with a six-week chart run.<ref name=\"NumanUKChartsOverview\" /> The heavily percussive funk style however made several tracks from the album such as the 12\" version of \"[[Music for Chameleons (song)|Music for Chameleons]]\" and a special remix of \"White Boys and Heroes\" unexpected successes in the American club scene<ref>[https://archive.beggars.com/numan-gary-i-assassin/ Gary Numan, I, Assassin | The Arkive] Beggars Banquet</ref> and 18 months after Numan's \"farewell concerts\" in April 1981 he embarked on a US tour.<ref>[http://www.nureference.co.uk/Tour%201982%20I,%20Assassin%20Tour%20US.htm I, Assassin Tour US 1982] nureference.co.uk</ref>\n\n''[[Warriors (Gary Numan album)|Warriors]]'' (1983) further developed Numan's jazz-influenced style and featured contributions from [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] musician [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]] (who fell out with Numan during recording and chose to be uncredited as the album's co-producer),<ref name=\"PrayingtotheAliens\">{{cite book |title=Praying to the Aliens |date=30 September 1998 |publisher=Gardner's Books |location=Eastbourne, United Kingdom |isbn=0233993371 |edition=2}}</ref> and saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]] (who also performed on ''[[Strange Charm]]'' and ''[[Outland (Gary Numan album)|Outland]]'').<ref name=\"DMorrisseyAllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Ankey |first1=Jason |title=Dick Morrissey |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dick-morrissey-mn0000256519/credits |website=AllMusic |publisher=Netaktion, Inc. |access-date=15 December 2020}}</ref> The album peaked at No.&nbsp;12, produced two hit singles including the top 20 title-track and, like ''I, Assassin'', spent six weeks in the charts.<ref name=\"NumanUKChartsOverview\" /> ''Warriors'' was the last album Numan recorded for Beggars Banquet Records, and was supported by a 40-date UK tour (again with support from robotic mime and music duo Tik and Tok).<ref name=\"WarriorsPoster\">{{cite web |title=Poster Publicity & Display Ltd. |url=http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1169259/poster-publicity-display-ltd/ |website=Search the Collections |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |access-date=15 December 2020}}</ref>\n\n===1984\u20131990: Record label foundation and collaborations===\nNuman subsequently issued a series of albums and singles on his own record label, Numa.
