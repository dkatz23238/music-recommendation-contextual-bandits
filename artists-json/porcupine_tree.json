By late 1993, however, he wanted to work in a band environment, bringing on frequent collaborators [[Richard Barbieri]] as keyboardist, [[Colin Edwin]] as bassist, and [[Chris Maitland]] as drummer to form the first permanent lineup. With Wilson as lead vocalist and guitarist, this remained the lineup until February 2002, when Maitland left the band and [[Gavin Harrison]] was recruited to replace him. Porcupine Tree's early sound evoked various styles of [[psychedelic rock]], [[space rock]] and [[experimental rock]], later moving towards a more [[progressive rock|progressive]]/space rock direction comparable to that of [[Pink Floyd]]. Upon signing with [[Kscope]] [[record label]] in the late 1990s, the band began to approach a more mainstream [[alternative rock]] sound. By the early 2000s, the band had signed to a [[major record label]] and shifted their sound again, this time in a more [[progressive metal]] direction. \n\nIn 2010, after the tour in support of their 2009 studio album ''[[The Incident (album)|The Incident]]'', the band became publicly inactive as Wilson committed himself to his solo work and other members began working on their own separate projects. However, Wilson, Barbieri and Harrison continued to intermittently work on material in secrecy over the course of the following decade, leading to the release of their album ''[[Closure/Continuation]]'' on 24 June 2022.\n\n==History==\n===Origins (1987\u20131990)===\nPorcupine Tree originated in 1987 as a collaborative hoax project by Steven Wilson and Malcolm Stocks. Partially inspired by the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]/[[Progressive rock|progressive]] bands of the 1970s, such as Pink Floyd, that had dominated the music scene during their youth, the two decided to form a fictional legendary rock band named The Porcupine Tree. The two fabricated a detailed back-story including information on alleged band members and album titles, as well as a \"colourful\" history which purportedly included events such as a meeting at a 1970s rock festival and several trips in and out of prison. As soon as he had put aside enough money to buy his own studio equipment, Wilson obliged this creation with several hours of music to provide \"evidence\" of its existence. Although Stocks provided a few passages of treated vocals and experimental guitar playing, his role in the project was mostly offering occasional ideas, with the bulk of the material being written, recorded, played, and sung by Wilson.\n\nAt this point, Porcupine Tree was little more than a joke and a private amusement, as Wilson was concentrating on his other project, [[No-Man]], an endeavour with UK based singer and songwriter [[Tim Bowness]]. However, by 1989, he began to consider some of the Porcupine Tree music as potentially marketable. Wilson created an 80-minute-long [[audio cassette|cassette]] titled ''[[Tarquin's Seaweed Farm]]'' under the name of Porcupine Tree.<ref name=\"Porcupine Tree Biography\"/> Still showing the spirit of his joke, Wilson included an eight-page inlay which further revealed the hoaxed Porcupine Tree backstory, including references to fictitious band members such as Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones.<ref name=\"Steven Wilson -The Complete Discography (6th Edition)\">{{cite web|url=http://www.voyage-pt.de/swdisco.pdf|title=Steven Wilson -The Complete Discography (6th Edition), p. 20|access-date=15 May 2007|first=Uwe|last=H\u00e4berle|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621210549/http://www.voyage-pt.de/swdisco.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nWilson sent out copies of ''Tarquin's Seaweed Farm'' to several people he felt would be interested in the recordings. Nick Saloman, the cult UK guitarist better known as [[The Bevis Frond]], had suggested that he send one to Richard Allen, a writer for the UK counter-cultural magazine ''[[Encyclopaedia Psychedelica]]'' and co-editor of the UK psychedelic [[garage rock]] magazine ''[[Freakbeat]]''. Allen reviewed the tape in both magazines. Whilst he disliked some of the material, he gave much of it a positive review. Several months later, Allen invited Wilson to contribute a track to the double LP ''A Psychedelic Psauna'' that was being put together to launch the new Delerium label. Allen would also become the band's manager, press agent, and promoter until 2004, his role in marketing the band's image decreasing after ''The Sky Moves Sideways'' album. In the meantime, Wilson had continued to work on new material. In 1990, he released the ''[[Love, Death & Mussolini]]'' EP, issued in a very limited run of 10 copies.  The EP remains an extremely rare, collectible piece. It was composed of nine at-the-time-unreleased tracks, as a preview for the upcoming second album. In 1991, Wilson released a second full-length Porcupine Tree cassette called ''[[The Nostalgia Factory]]'', which further expanded Porcupine Tree's underground fanbase, although at this point, the band was still carrying on the charade of being 1970s rock legends. By this point, Porcupine Tree was entirely a solo project, with Stocks having amicably moved on to other activities.\n\n===The Delerium years (1991\u20131997)===\n\n====''On the Sunday of Life...''====\nAlong with the ''A Psychedelic Psauna'' compilation, which featured the Porcupine Tree track \"Linton Samuel Dawson\", the newly formed [[Delerium Records|Delerium]] label, formed by ''Freakbeat'' editors Richard Allen and Ivor Trueman, offered to reissue the cassettes ''Tarquin's Seaweed Farm'' and ''The Nostalgia Factory''. Two hundred copies of each cassette were sold through ''Freakbeat's'' mail order, The Freak Emporium, and soon Porcupine Tree became known as a mysterious new act amongst the then UK underground psychedelic music scene.\n\nShortly thereafter, Delerium invited Wilson to sign as one of the label's founder artists. The first release after this, a double vinyl album and single CD compiling the best material from his two cassettes, was released in mid-1992 as ''[[On the Sunday of Life]]'', a title chosen from a long list of possible nonsense titles compiled by Richard Allen. The rest of the music from the initial tapes was released on the limited edition [[compilation album]] ''[[Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape]]''.\n\nIn 1992, Delerium released ''On the Sunday of Life'' as an edition of 1,000 copies, complete with a deluxe gatefold sleeve. The album sold very well, particularly in Italy, and it was briefly repressed on vinyl and has remained in print on CD ever since its release. The album featured future concert favourite and frequent [[encore (concert)|encore]] song \"Radioactive Toy\". By 2000, ''On the Sunday of Life...'' had accumulated sales of more than 20,000 copies.<ref name=\"Porcupine Tree Biography\">{{cite web|url= http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.cfm|title= Porcupine Tree Biography|website= PorcupineTree.com|access-date= 15 May 2007|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410092648/http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.cfm|archive-date= 10 April 2008|df= dmy-all}}</ref> ''On the Sunday of Life'' was originally meant to be a quadruple (LP)/double (CD) album compiling both cassettes in full, but changed to the best (according to Wilson) songs from the tapes. In 2004, Wilson remixed and remastered all three tapes, releasing them as a three-CD box set called ''Footprints: Cassette Music 1988-1992''. This box was only distributed to family and friends.\n\n====''Up the Downstair''====\nIn the midst of Porcupine Tree's rising success, Wilson's other band, No-Man, had been getting excellent UK press, which led to the band being signed to leading UK independent music publisher, Hit & Run Music Publishing, in 1991, which resulted in recording agreements with [[One Little Indian Records]], and Epic 440/Sony in the US. No-Man's success gave Wilson the opportunity to leave his regular job and devote his time solely to music. All of the Delirium releases were published by Hit & Run, whose executive Dave Massey had signed No-Man and continued to be closely involved in Wilson's Porcupine Tree project.\n\nIn May 1993, the second Porcupine Tree album, ''[[Up the Downstair]]'', was released, another prospective double album that was finally slimmed down to a single record. \"Voyage 34\" was actually going to take up the second disc, but it was last decided to be released alone as a single. The album was highly praised, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' describing it as \"a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delerium.co.uk/delerium/releases/delec020.html|title=Delerium Records: Porcupine Tree \u2013 Up The Downstair|date=2000|access-date=18 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826202210/http://www.delerium.co.uk/delerium/releases/delec020.html |archive-date=26 August 2007}}</ref> The album continued the [[fusion (music)|fusion]] of [[electronic music]] and rock and also featured guest appearances from two future Porcupine Tree members, [[Richard Barbieri]], of 1970s-80s art rock band [[Japan (band)|Japan]], and [[Colin Edwin]].\n\nIn November 1993, ''[[Voyage 34]]'' was reissued alongside an additional [[12-inch single|12-inch]] [[remix]] by Astralasia. The album managed to enter the ''[[NME]]'' indie chart for six weeks and became an underground chill-out classic, even without radio play.<ref name=\"Porcupine Tree Biography\" />\n\n====''The Sky Moves Sideways''====\nThe profile of Porcupine Tree had now grown to the extent that Wilson wanted to expand into live performances. Thus, in December 1993, Porcupine Tree became a live unit featuring Steven Wilson on lead vocals/guitar, Colin Edwin on bass, Chris Maitland on drums, and Richard Barbieri on keyboards.<ref name=\"MusicPlayers\">{{cite web|url= http://www.musicplayers.com/features/guitars/2007/0707_Steven_Wilson.php|title=  Steven Wilson: Fear of a Blank Interview |website=MusicPlayers.com |first= Scott |last=Kahn|access-date= 8 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{listen\n | filename     = Porcupine Tree - The Sky Moves Sideways (European Edition) - 01 - The Sky Moves Sideways (Phase One).ogg\n | title        = \"The Sky Moves Sideways Phase 1\"\n | description  = from ''The Sky Moves Sideways'', which contains some of the Steven Wilson's longest compositions.

The song is mostly instrumental and consists of four movements; the US release has an individual track for each section.\n | format       = ogg\n}}\n\nAll three new members of the group had worked with Wilson on various projects over the preceding years, especially Barbieri and Maitland, who had been part of No-Man's touring band. The new line-up's first live album, ''[[Spiral Circus]]'', contained recordings from their first three performances, including a [[BBC Radio 1|BBC Radio One]] session for [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]], an early champion of the group.\n\nPorcupine Tree's next album did not emerge until early 1995, but was preceded by the ''[[Moonloop]]'' EP, the last two tracks of which were recorded during the album sessions and were the first to feature the new band. Released in 1995, the band's third studio album, ''[[The Sky Moves Sideways]]'' became a success among [[progressive rock]] fans and Porcupine Tree were hailed as the Pink Floyd of the 1990s. Wilson later lamented this, stating, \"I can't help that. It's true that during the period of ''The Sky Moves Sideways'', I had done a little too much of it in the sense of satisfying, in a way, the fans of Pink Floyd who were listening to us because that group doesn't make albums any more. Moreover, I regret it\".\n\n''The Sky Moves Sideways'' was an expansive [[soundscape]] of [[melody]] and ambient rock experimentation, but proved to be a transitional work with half recorded before the formation of the band and half recorded after. Most of the album was taken up with the 35-minute title track, which at one point Steven had intended to be long enough to occupy the whole album. An alternate version of the track, containing some of the excised music, was included on the 2004 remastered version of the album. It also entered the ''NME'', ''Melody Maker'', and ''[[Music Week]]'' charts.<ref name=\"Porcupine Tree Biography\" /> Together with the ''Moonloop'' EP, this album was the first Porcupine Tree music issued in [[Americas|America]] in the autumn of 1995, and attracted favourable press on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The band supported the album with numerous concerts throughout the year at major music venues in the UK, the Netherlands, Italy, and Greece.\n\n====''Signify''====\nPartly unsatisfied with the half band/half solo nature of ''The Sky Moves Sideways'', Porcupine Tree promptly got down to the task of recording the first proper band record. Wilson admitted he was always \"in love with the idea of the rock band\" because \"bands have a kind of glamour, and appeal, and a romance about them the solo projects just don't have.\"<ref name=\"Aural Innovations Issue No.7\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue7/ptree03.html|title=Porcupine Tree (Review/Interview)|magazine=Aural Innovations|first1=Jerry|last1=Kranitz|first2=Keith|last2=Henderson|date=July 1999|issue=7|access-date=7 January 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312134918/http://www.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue7/ptree03.html |archive-date=2007-03-12}}</ref> The band worked sporadically over the next year on developing a tighter and more ambitious rock sound.\n\n{{listen\n | filename    = Porcupine Tree - Every Home Is Wired.ogg\n | title       = \"Every Home Is Wired\"\n | description = from ''Signify''.

All three dates were recorded for use in the 1997 live album ''[[Coma Divine \u2013 Recorded Live in Rome]]'' that was released as a goodbye to Delerium Records, which felt it could no longer offer the kind of resources the band needed  to continue to build its profile worldwide. In late 1997 Porcupine Tree's first three albums were [[remaster]]ed and reissued. ''Signify'' also was released in the US on [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]]'s [[Ark 21 Records|Ark 21]] label.\n\n===The Snapper years (1998\u20132001)===\n\n====''Stupid Dream''====\nWilson, Barbieri, Edwin, and Maitland spent all of 1998 recording their fifth studio album, a release that reflected the band's move towards a more song-oriented writing. Wilson acknowledged this time he was \"much more interested in songwriting as an art form, as opposed to soundscape development\" and commented he took influence from [[The Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]], and \"anything with really good ensemble singing\". He also indicated that he was \"interested in the idea of the pop song as a kind of experimental symphony\".\n\n{{listen\n|filename=Porcupine Tree - Pure Narcotic.ogg|title=\"Pure Narcotic\"|description=is a single from ''Stupid Dream''. \"Pure Narcotic\" is an acoustic song without drums.

The album was supported by a tour of the United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, France, Poland, and the United States. The three singles taken from the album: \"[[Piano Lessons (single)|Piano Lessons]]\", \"[[Stranger by the Minute]]\", and \"[[Pure Narcotic]]\", all achieved mainstream exposure in the US and in Europe, and placed well in the UK independent charts and on radio-station playlists. Although the album was a departure from their earlier sound, it brought the band new-found popularity and went on to become the band's best-selling and most acclaimed release up to that time.\n\n====''Lightbulb Sun''====\nCompleted for February 2000, with string arrangements provided by [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]] of [[XTC]], Porcupine Tree's sixth studio album, ''[[Lightbulb Sun]]'', built on the mix of songwriting, soundscaping, and rock dynamics of ''Stupid Dream''. The album was released in May 2000, preceded by the single \"[[Four Chords That Made a Million]]\". A sold-out show at the [[Scala (club)|Scala]] in London began a short run of UK shows, that were followed later in the year by European festival dates and a major tour supporting [[Dream Theater]]. The band continued touring through the end of 2000 and start of 2001, including their first major tour of Germany. A special double CD edition of the ''Lightbulb Sun'' album was issued in [[Israel]] and Germany.\n\nIn May, the band released a compilation [[B-side]] album called ''[[Recordings (album)|Recordings]]'', which featured nine tracks from the ''Stupid Dream'' and ''Lightbulb Sun'' sessions that had been left off both albums.

The band welcomed drummer and longtime acquaintance Gavin Harrison as his replacement. In March 2002, a [[box set]] of the band's early work was released, ''[[Stars Die: The Delerium Years 1991\u20131997]]'', and the band commenced recording their first major label album, drawing from a pool of 30 new songs written by Wilson in the previous two years.

The band also released a [[Surround sound|5.1 surround-sound]] version of the album, mixed by [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer [[Elliot Scheiner]].

On tour, the new line-up of the band was further augmented by additional touring vocalist/guitarist [[John Wesley (guitarist)|John Wesley]]. During these tours, the visual element of the band's performance was taken to new heights with the involvement of [[film director|filmmaker]] and photographer [[Lasse Hoile]], who had created the cover art for ''In Absentia'' and now went on to create a dark and [[Surrealism|surreal]] visual to Porcupine Tree's music.

The first release on the Transmission label was a studio session recorded for [[XM Satellite Radio|XM Radio]], Washington, DC, followed in 2004 by a recording from Polish radio in 2001. The band used the label to issue supplemental content, such as EPs, demos, and live recordings. Additionally, a reissue/remaster campaign also began in 2003, with many of the early albums expanded to double CDs. These reissues included re-recorded/remixed double-CD versions of the ''Up the Downstair'', ''The Sky Moves Sideways'', and ''Signify'' albums, and the reissue of ''Stupid Dream'' and ''Lightbulb Sun'', both consisting of a CD with a new stereo mix of the album plus a [[DVD-Audio]] with a 5.1 surround mix.\n\n====''Deadwing''====\nIn early 2004, the band embarked on the recording sessions for their next record, ''[[Deadwing]]'', their second for Lava/Atlantic. The album takes its inspiration from a [[screenplay|film script]] written by Wilson with his filmmaker friend Mike Bennion.  The album sessions completed in November 2004, and ''Deadwing'' was released in Europe and the US during the spring of 2005 as both a stereo and 5.1 surround-sound album, preceded by the release of two singles, \"[[Shallow (Porcupine Tree song)|Shallow]]\" in the US and \"[[Lazarus (Porcupine Tree song)|Lazarus]]\" in Europe. The album benefited from guest appearances by [[Adrian Belew]] from [[King Crimson]] and Opeth's [[Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt]], and was a commercial success, due in part to \"Shallow\" receiving airplay, peaking at number 26 on ''[[Billboard Charts|Billboard]]'s'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]].<ref name=\"Billboard Peak Position of 'Shallow'\">{{cite magazine|url= http://billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=141384&model.vnuAlbumId=785460|title= Billboard Peak Position of 'Shallow'|magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| access-date= 7 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411075011/http://billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=141384&model.vnuAlbumId=785460 |archive-date= 11 April 2008}}</ref> Additionally, \"Lazarus\" entered the German singles Top 100 at number 91.<ref name=\"Germany Singles Top 100\">{{cite web|url= http://acharts.us/song/4541|title= Porcupine Tree \u2013 Lazarus \u2013 Music Charts|publisher= \u03b1Charts.us|access-date= 21 January 2007|url-status= live|archive-url= http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110630004757/http://acharts.us/song/4541|archive-date= 30 June 2011|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The song \"Shallow\" was also featured in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430105/soundtrack|title=Four Brothers (2005) \u2013 Soundtracks|website=[[The Internet Movie Database]]|access-date=2 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026175441/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430105/soundtrack|archive-date=26 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe album won the Surround Music Awards for \"Best Made-For-Surround Title\" the same year of its release<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surroundexpo.com/awards.shtml |title=Surround Expo 2005 |date=15 December 2005 |access-date=15 December 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214183245/http://www.surroundexpo.com/awards.shtml |archive-date=14 December 2005 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and was voted number-two album of 2005 in ''[[Sound and Vision (magazine)|Sound & Vision]]'', the most widely distributed US magazine in the field of home electronics and entertainment.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/article/sv-2005-entertainment-awards |title= S&V 2005 Entertainment Awards |date= 4 February 2006 |access-date=3 September 2012}}</ref> Porcupine Tree released ''Deadwing'' in Japan on 22 March 2006, the first album by the band to be released in that country.\n\nThe tour to promote the album commenced in the UK at the end of March, and continued throughout the year.

to write songs about the negative side of the world than it is about the happy side of the world.\" In the ''Warszawa'' live radio broadcast album, before performing \"Stop Swimming\", Wilson can be heard saying \"the saddest music is often the most beautiful.\"\n\nPorcupine Tree is an album-oriented band, making records where many songs are related to each other.<ref name=\"Free Williamsburg\"/>  Wilson has said: <blockquote>\"The important thing with Porcupine Tree is that all our songs have a unique sound world that they inhabit. I don't like the idea of any song sounding like any other song. So most of the time it's a case of finding the sound world first whether it be a texture or a drum rhythm that sets you off on a certain musical path, or particular musical atmosphere, or flavour.\"<ref name=\"Free Williamsburg\"/></blockquote> For their recordings, the band has included [[mellotron]], [[banjo]], [[hammered dulcimer]], and [[guimbri]], among other instruments unusual for rock bands.{{opinion|date=November 2021}}\n\nAbove all, Porcupine Tree's music has maintained a strong textural and experimental quality, often fusing many genres in a single track. The band's work is noted for its [[ambient music|atmospheric]] nature, largely due to Barbieri's keyboard style and sound-processing abilities, and Wilson's cinematic scope, as a declared fan of American filmmaker [[David Lynch]], whose films are renowned for their sonic content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=3724|title=KNAC.COM \u2013 Features \u2013 Interview With Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson|date=25 June 2005|access-date=11 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210070535/http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=3724|archive-date=10 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/therealstevenwilson|title=Steven Wilson's MySpace|access-date=11 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719095355/http://www.myspace.com/therealstevenwilson|archive-date=19 July 2008}}</ref> \"Very layered, very produced, very arranged and [with] complex arrangements\" is the way Wilson describes the sound of the band.<ref name=\"High Fidelity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.highfidelityreview.com/features/porcupine_tree.asp |title=Porcupine Tree in Absentia DVD-Audio \u2013 Steven Wilson Interview |publisher=HighFidelityReview.com |date=7 March 2004 |access-date=8 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404160609/http://www.highfidelityreview.com/features/porcupine_tree.asp |archive-date=4 April 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Apart from their regular edition, the albums ''Stupid Dream'', ''Lightbulb Sun'', ''In Absentia'', ''Deadwing'', ''Fear of a Blank Planet'', and ''The Incident'' are available in [[Digital Theater System|DTS]] (5.1 Surround Sound) mix; this mixing technique has become a tradition for the band in recent years.\n\nThe band's live performances have also been praised, with [[Music Radar]] placing them fourth in their list of \"The 30 greatest live acts in the world today\" in 2010.<ref>[http://i775.photobucket.com/albums/yy35/synesthetize/NuevoLienzo.png Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326031043/http://i775.photobucket.com/albums/yy35/synesthetize/NuevoLienzo.png |date=26 March 2012 }}/[http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/the-30-greatest-live-acts-in-the-world-today-462684/28 Original]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917052448/http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/the-30-greatest-live-acts-in-the-world-today-462684/28 |date=17 September 2012 }}. \"The 30 greatest live acts in the world today\" by [[Music Radar]].
