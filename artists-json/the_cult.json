Please do not change \"are\" to \"is\". See WP:ENGVAR for more info. --> an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1983 in [[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]]. Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer [[Ian Astbury]]'s previous band [[Southern Death Cult]]. They gained a dedicated following in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s as a [[post-punk]]/[[gothic rock]] band, with singles such as \"[[She Sells Sanctuary]]\", before breaking into the mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s establishing themselves as a [[hard rock]] band with singles such as \"[[Love Removal Machine]]\". Since its initial formation in 1983, the band have had various line-ups; the longest-serving members are Astbury and guitarist [[Billy Duffy]], who are also the band's two songwriters.\n\nThe Cult's debut studio album ''[[Dreamtime (The Cult album)|Dreamtime]]'' was released in 1984 to moderate success, with its lead single \"[[Spiritwalker]]\" reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the [[UK Independent Singles and Albums Charts|UK Indie Chart]]. Their second studio album, ''[[Love (The Cult album)|Love]]'' (1985), was also successful, charting at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK and including singles such as \"She Sells Sanctuary\" and \"[[Rain (The Cult song)|Rain]]\". The band's third album, ''[[Electric (The Cult album)|Electric]]'' (1987), launched them to new heights of success, also peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK and charting highly in other territories, and spawned the hit singles \"Love Removal Machine\", \"Lil' Devil\" and \"Wild Flower\". On that album, the Cult supplemented their post-punk sound with hard rock; the polish on this new sound was facilitated by producer [[Rick Rubin]]. After moving to Los Angeles, California, where the band has been based for the remainder of their career,<ref>{{cite news|title=Everynight Charley's Manhattan Beat: Michael Monroe, Cannibal Corpse, The Cult and More|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2016/03/16/everynight-charleys-manhattan-beat-michael-monroe-cannibal-corpse-the-cult-and-more/|newspaper=[[The Aquarian Weekly]]|date=16 March 2016|access-date=6 June 2017|archive-date=11 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711011839/http://www.theaquarian.com/2016/03/16/everynight-charleys-manhattan-beat-michael-monroe-cannibal-corpse-the-cult-and-more/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ian Astbury net worth!|url=http://anetworth.net/ian-astbury-net-worth/|publisher=anetworth.net|access-date=6 June 2017|archive-date=10 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110005002/http://anetworth.net/ian-astbury-net-worth/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Cult at Mountain Winery \u2013 Tickets \u2013 The Mountain Winery \u2013 Saratoga, CA \u2013 June 5th, 2016|url=http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1158397-cult-mountain-winery-saratoga/|publisher=ticketfly.com|access-date=6 June 2017|archive-date=10 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110114629/https://www.ticketfly.com/event/1158397-cult-mountain-winery-saratoga/|url-status=live}}</ref> the Cult continued the musical experimentation of ''Electric'' with its follow-up album ''[[Sonic Temple]]'' (1989), which marked their first collaboration with [[Bob Rock]], who would produce several of the band's subsequent albums. ''Sonic Temple'' was their most successful album to that point, entering the Top 10 on the UK and US charts, and included one of the band's most popular songs \"[[Fire Woman]]\".\n\nBy the time of their fifth album ''[[Ceremony (The Cult album)|Ceremony]]'' (1991), tensions and creative differences began to surface between the band members. This resulted in the recording sessions for ''Ceremony'' being held without a stable lineup, leaving Astbury and Duffy as the only two official members, and featuring support from session musicians on bass and drums. The ongoing tension had carried over within the next four years, during which they released one more studio album, ''[[The Cult (album)|The Cult]]'' (1994), and disbanded in 1995.<ref name=\"BIOAMG\" /> The Cult reformed in 1999 and released their seventh album ''[[Beyond Good and Evil (album)|Beyond Good and Evil]]'' two years later. The commercial failure of the album and resurfaced tensions led to the band going back on hiatus in 2002. They resumed activity in 2006, and have since released four more studio albums: ''[[Born into This]]'' (2007), ''[[Choice of Weapon]]'' (2012), ''[[Hidden City (album)|Hidden City]]'' (2016) and ''Under the Midnight Sun'' (2022).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history (1981\u20131984)===\n{{Main|Southern Death Cult}}\n\nThe band's origins can be traced to 1981, in [[Bradford]], [[Yorkshire]], where vocalist and songwriter Ian Astbury formed a band called [[Southern Death Cult]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deathrock.com/southerndeathcult/main.html| title = The Southern Death Cult | work = Deathrock.com | access-date = 15 January 2007 }}</ref> The name was chosen with a [[double entendre|double meaning]], and was derived from the 14th-century Native American religion, the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] or Southern Death Cult as it was sometimes known, from the [[Mississippi]] delta area,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mississippian-artifacts.com/html/shellorn.html | title = Shell Ornaments | work = Mississippian-Artifacts.com | access-date = 15 January 2007 | archive-date = 8 February 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208121801/http://www.mississippian-artifacts.com/html/shellorn.html | url-status = live }}</ref> but it was also a stab at what the band viewed was the centralisation of power in [[Southern England]] (including that of the [[music industry]]); there has long been a perceived notion of a [[North-South divide in the United Kingdom|North\u2013South divide]] based on social, historic and economic reasons.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://thearchive.free.fr/arch-sdeathcult.htm| title = Southern Death Cult NME 1982| work = NME| access-date = 15 January 2007| archive-date = 7 February 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120207071143/http://thearchive.free.fr/arch-sdeathcult.htm| url-status = live}}</ref> Astbury was joined by Buzz Burrows (guitar), Barry Jepson (bass) and [[Aki Nawaz|Aki Nawaz Qureshi]] (drums); they performed their first show at the ''Queen's Hall'' in their hometown of Bradford on 29 October 1981.<ref name=\"redsun\">{{cite web| url = http://www.redsunrecords.com/product_info.php?products_id=751&cPath=78&language=fr| title = Southern Death Cult| work = Red Sun Press| access-date = 15 January 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120210140717/http://www.redsunrecords.com/product_info.php?products_id=751&cPath=78&language=fr| archive-date = 10 February 2012| url-status = dead}}</ref> The band were at the forefront of an emerging style of music, in the form of [[post-punk]] and [[gothic rock]], they achieved critical acclaim from the press and music fans.<ref name=\"redsun\" />\n\nThe band signed to independent record label [[Situation Two]], an offshoot of [[Beggars Banquet Records]], and released a three-track, triple A-side single, ''Moya'', during this period. They toured through England headlining some shows and touring with [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[Theatre of Hate]].<ref name=\"redsun\" /> The band played their final performance in [[Manchester]] during February 1983, meaning after only sixteen months the band was over. A compilation named ''[[The Southern Death Cult (album)|The Southern Death Cult]]'' was released, this being a collection of the single, radio sessions with [[John Peel]] for [[BBC Radio 1|Radio One]] and live performances - one of which an audience member recorded with a tape recorder.<ref name=\"redsun\" />\n\nIn April 1983, Astbury teamed up with guitarist Billy Duffy and formed the band \"Death Cult\". Duffy had been in [[Ed Banger and the Nosebleeds|the Nosebleeds]] (along with [[Morrissey]]), Lonesome No More and then [[Theatre of Hate]]. In addition to Astbury and Duffy, the band also included [[Jamie Stewart (The Cult)|Jamie Stewart]] (bass) and [[Ray Mondo|Raymond Taylor Smith]] (later known as [[Ray Mondo]]) (drums), both from the [[Harrow, London]] based post-punk band, [[Ritual (post-punk band)|Ritual]]. Death Cult made their live debut in [[Oslo]], Norway on 25 July 1983 and also released the ''[[Death Cult (EP)|Death Cult]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in the same month, then toured through mainland Europe and Scotland. In September 1983, [[Ray Mondo|Mondo]] was deported to his home country of Sierra Leone and replaced by [[Nigel Preston]], formerly of Theatre of Hate. The single \"[[Gods zoo|Gods Zoo]]\" was released in October 1983. Another European tour, with UK dates, followed that autumn. To tone down their name's gothic connotations and gain broader appeal, the band changed its name to \"the Cult\" in January 1984 before appearing on the (UK) [[Channel 4]] television show, ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]''.\n\nThe Cult's first studio record, [[Dreamtime (The Cult album)|''Dreamtime'']], was recorded at Rockfield Studios, in [[Monmouth, Wales]] in 1984. The record was to be produced by Joe Julian, but after recording the drum tracks, the band decided to replace him with John Brand. Brand produced the record, but guitarist Duffy has said the drum tracks were produced by Julian, as Preston had become unreliable.\n\nThe band recorded the songs which later became known as \"Butterflies\", \"(The) Gimmick\", \"A Flower in the Desert\", \"Horse Nation\", \"[[Spiritwalker]]\", \"Bad Medicine (Waltz)\", \"Dreamtime\", \"With Love\" (later known as \"Ship of Fools\", and also \"Sea and Sky\"), \"Bone Bag\", \"Too Young\", \"83rd Dream\", and one untitled outtake. It is unknown what the outtake was, or whether it was developed into a song at a later date. Songs like \"Horse Nation\" showed Astbury's intense interest in Native American issues, with the lyrics to \"Horse Nation\", ''\"See them prancing, they come neighing, to a horse nation\"'', taken almost verbatim from the book ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]'', while \"[[Spiritwalker]]\" dealt with [[shamanism]], and the record's title and title track are overtly influenced by Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] beliefs.\n\nOn 4 April 1984, the Cult released the single \"[[Spiritwalker]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;1 on the independent charts in the UK, and acted as a teaser for their forthcoming album ''[[Dreamtime (The Cult album)|Dreamtime]]''. This was followed that summer by a second single, \"[[Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)]]\", before the release of ''Dreamtime'' in September; the album reached No.&nbsp;21 in the UK, and sold over 100,000 copies in the UK alone. On 12 July 1984, the band recorded five songs at the [[BBC]] Maida Vale 5 studio for a Richard Skinner session. Before and after the album's release, the Cult toured throughout Europe and England before recording another single, \"[[Ressurection Joe]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;74), released that December. Following a Christmas support slot with [[Big Country]], the Cult toured Europe with support from [[The Mission (band)|the Mission]] (then called the Sisterhood). ''Dreamtime'' was released initially only in the UK, but after its success, and as the Cult's popularity grew worldwide, it was issued in approximately 30 countries.\n\n===Mainstream success (1985\u20131990)===\n{{Listen|filename=Cult - She Sells Sanctuary excerpt.ogg|title=The Cult - She Sells Sanctuary|description=An excerpt from \"She Sells Sanctuary\"}}\n\nIn May 1985, the Cult released their fourth single, \"[[She Sells Sanctuary]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;15 in the UK and spent 23 weeks in the Top 100. The song was recently voted No.&nbsp;18 in VH1's Indie 100{{when|date=March 2017}}. In June 1985, following his increasingly erratic behaviour, Preston was fired from the band. Big Country's drummer [[Mark Brzezicki]] was picked to replace Preston, and was also included in the video for \"She Sells Sanctuary\". The Cult then finished recording their second album, ''[[Love (Cult album)|Love]]'' in July and August 1985. The band's music and image shifted from their punk-oriented roots to 1960s [[Psychedelia#In popular culture|psychedelia]] influences. ''Love'' was a chart success, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK and selling 100,000 copies there<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |title=British Phonographic Industry certifications database |publisher=Bpi.co.uk |access-date=16 July 2011 |archive-date=2 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702214649/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> toward a total of 500,000 copies throughout Europe, as well as 100,000 in Australia and 500,000 copies in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=Recording Industry Association of America certifications database |publisher=Riaa.com |access-date=16 July 2011 |archive-date=26 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |url-status=live }}</ref> Love reached number 20 on the charts in The Netherlands, where it remained for 32 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=The+Cult&titel=Love&cat=a|title=The Cult - Love|website=Charts.nz|access-date=3 January 2021|archive-date=22 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922142527/https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=The+Cult&titel=Love&cat=a|url-status=live}}</ref> To date,{{when|date=January 2020}} the record has sold over two and a half million copies worldwide.\n\nFrom late September 1985 to June 1986, the band went on a worldwide tour with new drummer [[Les Warner]] (who had played with [[Julian Lennon]] and [[Johnny Thunders]]). Two more singles from the ''Love'' album followed; \"Rain\" (charting in the UK at No.&nbsp;17) and \"[[Revolution (The Cult song)|Revolution]]\" (charting in the UK at No.&nbsp;30). Neither charted in the US. Another single, \"Nirvana\", was issued only in Poland. The album version of \"Rain\", as well as the remix \"(Here Comes the) Rain\", were used in the Italian horror film ''[[D\u00e8moni 2]]''. Once back in England, the band booked themselves into the [[The Manor Studio|Manor Studios]] in Oxfordshire, with producer Steve Brown (who had produced ''Love''), and recorded over a dozen new songs. The band were unhappy with the sound of their new album, titled ''Peace'', and they decided to go to [[New York City|New York]] so producer Rick Rubin could remix the first single, \"Love Removal Machine\".\n\nRubin agreed to work with the band, but only if they rerecorded the song. Rubin eventually talked them into rerecording the entire album. The band's record company, Beggars Banquet, was displeased with this, as two months and \u00a3250,000 had already been spent on the record. However, after hearing the initial New York recording, Beggars Banquet agreed to proceed. The first single, \"Love Removal Machine\", was released in February 1987, and the new version of the album appeared in April that year, now renamed as ''[[Electric (The Cult album)|Electric]]'', reaching No.&nbsp;4 and eventually outselling ''Love''. The band toured with [[Kid Chaos]] (also known as \"Haggis\" and \"The Kid\") on bass, with Stewart on [[rhythm guitar]]. Two more singles, \"Lil Devil\" and \"Wild Flower\", were released during 1987. A few tracks from the original ''Peace'' album appeared on the single versions of \"Love Removal Machine\", and \"Lil Devil\". The full ''Peace'' album would not be released until 2000, when it was included as Disc 3 of the ''Rare Cult'' [[box set]].\n\nIn the US, the Cult, now consisting of Astbury, Duffy, Stewart, Warner and Kid Chaos, were supported by the then-unknown [[Guns N' Roses]]. The band also appeared at [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark in June 1987. When the world tour wound through Australia, the band wrecked \u00a330,000 worth of equipment, and as a result they could not tour Japan, as no company would rent them new equipment. At the end of the tour the ''Electric'' album had been certified Gold in the UK, and sold roughly 3 million copies worldwide, but the band were barely speaking to each other by then. Haggis left the band at the end of the ''Electric'' tour to form [[The Four Horsemen (band)|the Four Horsemen]] for Rubin's [[American Recordings (US)|Def American]] label. Astbury and Duffy fired Warner and their management team Grant/Edwards, and moved to [[Los Angeles]] with original bassist Stewart. Warner sued the band several times for his firing, as well as for what he felt were unpaid royalties due to him for his performance on the ''Electric'' album, resulting in lengthy court battles. The Cult signed a new management deal and wrote 21 new songs for their next record.\n\nFor the next album, Stewart returned to playing bass, and John Webster was brought in to play [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s. The band used Chris Taylor to play drums during rehearsals and record the demos, with future [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] drummer [[Eric Singer]] performing during the second demo recording sessions. The Cult eventually recruited session-drummer [[Mickey Curry]] to fill the drumming role and [[Aerosmith]] sound engineer, [[Bob Rock]], to produce. Recorded in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada from October to December 1988, the ''[[Sonic Temple]]'' record went Top 10 in both the UK and the US, where it was certified Gold and Platinum respectively. The band went on tour in support of the new album and new single \"[[Fire Woman]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;15) (NZ No.&nbsp;1), with yet another new drummer, [[Matt Sorum]], and Webster as keyboard player. The next single, \"[[Edie (Ciao Baby)]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;25) has become a regular song at concerts for many years.\n\nIn Europe, the band toured with [[Aerosmith]], and in the US, after releasing another single \"Sun King\" (UK No.&nbsp;42), they spent 1989 touring in support of [[Metallica]] before heading out on their own headlining tour later that same year. A fourth single, \"[[Sweet Soul Sister]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;38), was released in February 1990, with the video having been filmed at [[Wembley Arena]], London, on 25 November 1989. \"Sweet Soul Sister\" was partially written in [[Paris]] and was inspired by the [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle of that city. Released as a single in February 1990, the song was another hit in the UK, and reportedly reached number one on the rock charts in Brazil. After playing a show in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in February 1990, the band's management told Astbury that his father had just died of cancer. As a result, the remainder of the tour was cancelled after a final leg of shows were performed in April. After the tour ended, the band were on the verge of splitting due to Stewart retiring and moving to Canada to be with his wife, and Sorum leaving to join [[Guns N' Roses]].\n\nIn 1990, Astbury organized the [[A Gathering of the Tribes|Gathering of the Tribes]] festival in Los Angeles and [[San Francisco]] with artists such as [[Soundgarden]], [[Ice-T]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[The Charlatans (English band)|the Charlatans]], [[the Cramps]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] appearing. This two-day festival drew 40,000 people. Also in 1990, a ten CD box set was released in the UK, containing rare songs from the Cult's singles. The CDs in this box set were all issued as picture discs with [[rice paper]] covers, housed in a white box called \"Singles Collection\", or a black box called \"E.P. Collection '84 - '90\". In 1991, director [[Oliver Stone]] offered Astbury the role of [[Jim Morrison]] in Stone's film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]''. He declined the role because he was not happy with the way Morrison was represented in the film,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the role was ultimately played by [[Val Kilmer]].\n\n===''Ceremony'' and the lawsuit (1991\u20131993)===\nIn 1991, Astbury and Duffy were writing again for their next album. During the demo recordings, Todd Hoffman and [[James Kottak]] played bass and drums, respectively. During the actual album recording sessions, Curry was recruited again to play drums, with [[Charley Drayton]] on bass, and various other performers. Astbury and Duffy's working relationship had disintegrated by that time, with the two men reportedly rarely even being in the studio together during recording.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The resulting album ''[[Ceremony (The Cult album)|Ceremony]]'' was released to mixed responses. The album climbed to US No.&nbsp;34, but sales were not as impressive as the previous three records, only selling around one million copies worldwide. Only two official singles were released from the record: \"Wild Hearted Son\" (UK No.&nbsp;34, Canada No.&nbsp;41) and \"Heart of Soul\" (UK No.&nbsp;50), although \"White\" was released as a single only in Canada, \"Sweet Salvation\" was released as a single (as \"Dulce Salvaci\u00f3n\") in Argentina in 1992, and the title track \"Ceremony\" was released in Spain.\n\nThe Cult's ''Ceremonial Stomp'' tour went through Europe in 1991 and North America in 1992. In 1991 the Cult played a show at the [[Marquee Club]] in London, which was recorded and released in February 1993, packaged with some vinyl UK copies of their first greatest hits release. Only a handful of CD copies of it were ever manufactured originally, however it was subsequently reissued on CD in 1999. An incomplete [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] video of this show is also in circulation.\n\nThe band were sued by the parents of the Native American boy pictured on the cover of ''Ceremony'', for alleged exploitation and for the unauthorized use of the child's image. The parents stated that the boy felt he had been cursed by the band's burning of his image, and was \"emotionally scarred.\"<ref name=\"titleWRONG RITE? | Ceremony | Pop Culture News | News | Entertainment Weekly\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310840,00.html |title=Wrong Rite? |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=31 March 2008 |first=Sharon |last=Isaak |date=19 June 1992 |archive-date=9 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009195457/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310840,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This image of the boy is also burned in the video for \"Wild Hearted Son\". This lawsuit delayed the release of ''Ceremony'' in many countries including South Korea and Thailand, which did not see the record's release until late 1992, and it was unreleased in Turkey until the Cult played several shows in [[Istanbul]] in June 1993.\n\nA world tour followed with backing from drummer [[Michael Lee (musician)|Michael Lee]] ([[Page and Plant|Page & Plant]], [[Little Angels]]), bassist Kinley \"Barney\" Wolfe ([[Lord Tracy]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]]), and keyboardist [[John Sinclair (musician)|John Sinclair]] ([[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]]) returning one last time, and the Gathering of the Tribes moved to the UK. Here artists such as [[Pearl Jam]] performed. The warm-up gig to the show, in a small nightclub, was dedicated to the memory of Nigel Preston, who had died a few weeks earlier at the age of 28. Following the release of the single \"The Witch\" (#9 in Australia) and the performance of a song for the 1992 ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' movie soundtrack entitled \"Zap City\", produced by Steve Brown and originally a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to \"Lil' Devil\", two volumes of remixes of \"She Sells Sanctuary\", called ''Sanctuary Mixes MCMXCIII, volumes one and two'', and in support of ''[[Pure Cult: for Rockers, Ravers, Lovers, and Sinners]]'', a greatest hits compilation which debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the British charts and later went to number one in Portugal, Astbury and Duffy fired the \"backing band\" and recruited [[Craig Adams (musician)|Craig Adams]] (the Mission) and Scott Garrett for performances across Europe in 1993, with some shows featuring [[Mike Dimkich]] on rhythm guitar. This tour marked the first time the band performed in Turkey, Greece, and the Slovak Republic.\n\n===''The Cult'' and first breakup (1994\u20131998)===\nWith the same line-up still in place, the band released ''[[The Cult (album)|The Cult]]''<ref name=\"BIOAMG\"/><ref name=\"The Cult album AMG\">{{cite web | last = Franck | first = John | title = The Cult - The Cult Review | website = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = 22 March 2011 | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=the-cult-r207795/review|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref> in October 1994, produced by Bob Rock.<ref name=\"The Cult album AMG\"/> The self-titled album is commonly referred to as the \"Black Sheep\" album by fans of the group, due to the image of a black sheep on the front cover.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Demarais | first = Kirk | title = The Do's and Don'ts of Self-Titled Record Albums | publisher = Monkey Goggles | date = 9 September 2009 | access-date = 14 March 2011 | url = http://monkeygoggles.com/?p=685 | archive-date = 12 May 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110512221037/http://monkeygoggles.com/?p=685 | url-status = live }}</ref> Astbury referred to the record as a collection of \"very personal and very revealing\" songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of Nigel Preston, to his directionless years spent in [[Glasgow]] in the late 1970s.\n\nThe record achieved little success, only reaching No.&nbsp;69 in the US and No.&nbsp;21 in the UK. Duffy remarked that he thought that the record wouldn't sell well due to the offensive lyrics. The record went to number one in Portugal also, but quickly dropped out of sight. The single \"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\" was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, \"Star\", was officially released with a live appearance on UK TV show [[The Word (TV series)|''The Word'']]. \"Star\" began life in 1986 as \"Tom Petty\" and was recorded at the \"Sonic Temple\" demo sessions as \"Starchild\", being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993 the song was resurrected and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, \"Star\".\n\nWhen the band began the Beauty's On The Streets tour in winter 1994, they augmented the line up with [[James Stevenson (musician)|James Stevenson]] on rhythm guitar. As with the ''Ceremony'' record several years earlier, no other official singles were released, but several other songs were released on a strictly limited basis: \"Sacred Life\" was released in Spain and the Netherlands, \"Be Free\" was issued in Canada and France, \"Saints Are Down\" was issued in Greece, but none of the songs gained much commercial success. During this tour, the Cult made their first ever appearance in Norway.\n\nDuring the ''Black Rain'' tour of South America in spring of 1995, despite the fact that several more new songs had already been recorded, the tour was cancelled after an appearance in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in March, and the band split up citing unspecified problems on a recent South American tour. Astbury started up a [[garage rock|garage band]] called [[Holy Barbarians (band)|Holy Barbarians]] a few months later. The band made their debut at the [[100 Club]] in London in February 1996 and released their first (and only) record in May 1996, and toured throughout North America and Europe for the rest of 1996. The band started writing material for a second record in 1997, but the band was dissolved and Astbury began writing and recording a solo record. Throughout 1997 and 1998 Astbury recorded his solo record, originally to be titled ''Natural Born Guerilla'', later called ''High Time Amplifier''. Ultimately the record remained unreleased until June 2000 when it was released under the name ''[[Spirit\\Light\\Speed]]''. Astbury played one solo concert in 1999.\n\nIn November 1996, a number of CD reissues were released: the band's American record company released ''High Octane Cult'', a slightly updated [[greatest hits]] compilation released only in the US and Japan; ''The Southern Death Cult'', a remastered edition of the fifteen-song compilation CD; a ten-song compilation CD by Death Cult called ''Ghost Dance'', consisting of the untitled four-song EP, the single \"God's Zoo\", and four unreleased songs from a radio broadcast; and a remastered repackaging of the ''Dreamtime'' album, containing only the ten original songs from the record in their original playing order and almost completely different but original artwork. ''[[Dreamtime Live at the Lyceum]]'' was also remastered and issued on video and for the first time on CD, with the one unreleased song from the concert, \"Gimmick\".\n\n===First reunion, ''Beyond Good and Evil'' and second hiatus (1999\u20132005)===\n[[File:Ian Astbury di Cult.jpg|thumb|right |200px |Ian Astbury performing]]\nIn 1999, Astbury and Duffy reformed the Cult with Matt Sorum and ex-[[Porno for Pyros]] bassist [[Martyn LeNoble]]. Their first official concert was at the [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]] in June 1999, after having rehearsed at shows in the Los Angeles area. The band's 1999 ''Cult Rising'' reunion tour resulted in a sold out 30 date tour of the US, ending with 8 consecutive sold out nights at the LA [[House of Blues]]. In 2000, the band toured South Africa for the first time, and North and South America, and contributed the song \"[[Painted on My Heart]]\" to the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (soundtrack)|Gone In 60 Seconds]]''. The song was featured prominently and the melody was fused into parts of the score. In June, Astbury's long-delayed solo record was finally released as ''[[Spirit\\Light\\Speed]]'', but it failed to gain much success. In November 2000, another authorised greatest hits compilation was released, ''[[Pure Cult: The Singles 1984\u20131995]]'', along with an accompanying DVD, which was later certified gold in Canada. The Cult, as well as [[Ian Astbury]], performed on separate tracks on the [[The Doors|Doors]] tribute album, ''[[Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors]]'', covering \"Wild Child\" and \"[[Touch Me (The Doors song)|Touch Me]]\".\n\nIn November 2000, Beggars Banquet released 15,000 copies of a six-disc boxset (with a bonus seventh disc of remixes for the first 5000 copies) titled ''Rare Cult''. The box set consists of album out-takes, demos, radio broadcasts, and album B-sides. It is most notable for including the previously unreleased \"Peace\" album in its entirety. In 2001, the band signed to [[Atlantic Records]] and recorded a new album, ''[[Beyond Good and Evil (album)|Beyond Good and Evil]]'', originally being produced by [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], until Jones bowed out to tour with Foreigner. Astbury and Duffy co-wrote a song with Jones, an odd occurrence, as in the past, neither Astbury or Duffy would co-write their material. Bob Rock was the producer, with Martyn LeNoble and [[Chris Wyse]] as recording bassists, as [[Mike Dimkich]] played rhythm guitar on tour, and [[Matt Sorum]] returning as drummer. Although Sorum has previously toured with the band on the Sonic Temple tour in 1989, this was the first time that he had recorded a studio album with the band.\n\nHowever ''Beyond Good and Evil'' was not the comeback record the band had hoped for. Despite reaching No.&nbsp;37 in the US, No.&nbsp;22 in Canada, and No.&nbsp;25 in Spain, sales quickly dropped, only selling roughly 500,000 copies worldwide. The first single \"Rise\", reached No.&nbsp;41 in the US, and No.&nbsp;2 on the mainstream rock charts, but Atlantic Records quickly pulled the song from radio playlists. Astbury would later describe the experience with Atlantic to be \"soul destroying\", after Atlantic tried to tamper with the lyrics, the record cover, and choice of singles from the record.\n\nAfter the first single from the record, the band's working relationship with Atlantic was on paper only, with Atlantic pulling \"Rise\" from the radio stations playlists, and stopping all promotion of the record. The second single \"Breathe\" was only released as a radio station promo, and the final single \"True Believers\" was only on a compilation sampler disc released in January 2002 (after the Cult's tour had already ended). Despite \"True Believers\" receiving radio airplay in Australia, both singles went largely unnoticed, and both Astbury and Duffy walked away from the project. LeNoble rejoined the band for the initial dates in early 2001, and [[Billy Morrison]] filled in on bass for the majority of the 2001 tour.\n\nThe European tour of 2001 was canceled, largely due to security concerns after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] terrorist attacks, and the band flew back to the US to tour again with Aerosmith. But the eleven-week tour was considered by fans to be a disaster{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}, as the band played only a brief rundown of their greatest hits. In October 2001, a show at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]] in Los Angeles was filmed for release on DVD. After the tour ended in December 2001, the band took most of 2002 off, apart from a few shows in the US to promote the release of the DVD, with Scott Garrett and Craig Adams rejoining the band.\n\nDespite the commercial disappointment of ''Beyond Good and Evil'' and the supporting tour, the band was voted \"Comeback of the Year\" by [[Metal Edge]] readers in the magazine's 2001 Readers' Choice Awards.<ref>Metal Edge, June 2002</ref>\n\nIn late 2002, Ian Astbury declared the Cult to be \"on ice\" indefinitely, after performing a brief series of dates in October 2002 to promote the release of the ''Music Without Fear'' DVD. During this second hiatus, Astbury performed as a member of the Doors (later dubbed the Doors of the 21st Century, later still renamed D21c, and most recently known as [[The Doors#Riders on the Storm/Manzarek-Krieger (2002\u2013present)|Riders on the Storm]]) with two of the original members of that group. D21c was sued numerous times, both by Jim Morrison's family and by drummer [[John Densmore]]. Astbury supposedly started work on recording another solo album that later became the backbone for the Cult's ''[[Born into This]]''.\n\nAt the same time, Duffy was part of Coloursound with bassist Craig Adams and ex-[[The Alarm|Alarm]] frontman [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]], then [[Dead Men Walking]] (again with Peters) and later Cardboard Vampyres. Sorum became a member of the hard rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Velvet Revolver]]. In 2003, all of the Cult's records were issued on CD, with several bonus tracks being issued on the Russian, Belarusian, and Lithuanian versions. These eastern European releases had many printing mistakes on the jacket sleeves and lyric inserts. In October 2004, all of the Cult's records were again remastered and issued again on CD, this time in Japan in different cardboard foldout sleeves. \"She Sells Sanctuary\" appeared in the 2002 [[video game]] ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', playing on rock station [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack#V-Rock|V-Rock]].\n\n===Second reunion, ''Born Into This'' and ''Capsule'' EPs (2006\u20132010)===\n[[File:The Cult Drave Rock Fest 2007.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Cult playing at Drave Rock Fest in 2007]]\nDespite Astbury's previous statement from 2004 that a reunion would not happen,<ref>{{cite web|title=IAN ASTBURY Has No Future Plans With THE CULT|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ian-astbury-has-no-future-plans-with-the-cult/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=April 30, 2004|accessdate=September 24, 2021}}</ref> The Cult announced in January 2006 that they were reuniting for \"some limited gigs\" throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE CULT: First Show Announced|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-cult-first-show-announced/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 16, 2006|accessdate=September 24, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=THE CULT: San Diego Show Announced|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-cult-san-diego-show-announced/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 17, 2006|accessdate=September 24, 2021}}</ref> A month later, the band made their first live appearance in three-and-a-half years on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE CULT: Video Of 'Craig Ferguson' Performance Posted Online|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-cult-video-of-craig-ferguson-performance-posted-online/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 26, 2006|accessdate=September 24, 2021}}</ref> Their lineup consisted of Astbury (vocals), Duffy (lead guitar), [[John Tempesta]] (drums), Dimkich (rhythm guitar) and Wyse (returning as bassist). Their first stage show was held in March 2006 in San Francisco, California, at [[The Fillmore]]. The entire tour was recorded by [[Instant Live]] and sold after each show. In May, they did an eight date tour in Canada. Later that summer, they toured central and eastern Europe and played their first concerts in Bulgaria, Poland and Serbia. An eleven-date UK tour followed as well as several more dates in the United States, finishing with a [[South America]]n tour in December. That year, Duffy began the band [[Circus Diablo]] with Billy Morrison, Sorum, Brett Scallions and [[Ricky Warwick]].\n\nDuring these tours, the band occasionally played an extended set, including several songs the band had not performed in decades: \"King Contrary Man\" and \"Hollow Man\", neither of which had been performed since 1987; also, \"Libertine\" was performed approximately three times, for the first time since 2000, and \"Brother Wolf, Sister Moon\", which was only performed one time since 1986 (for this particular song, the band played an abridged version which has never been performed before or since)\n\nAstbury announced in February 2007 that he was leaving Riders on the Storm and returning to the Cult.
