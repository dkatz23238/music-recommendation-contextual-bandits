Throughout the band's career, they have released ten full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of sounds, all in their main style of industrial metal. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen frequent changes in its lineup, with lead vocalist [[Burton C. Bell]] being the only consistent member for 31 years until his departure in 2020. Other than guitarist [[Dino Cazares]], there are no original members left in its current lineup. The band went on hold in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but resumed activity a year later without founding member Cazares. Previous bassist [[Christian Olde Wolbers]] replaced him as the new guitarist, and bassist [[Byron Stroud]] joined the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=1962 |title=UPDATE: The Official Roadrunner Records Statement On FEAR FACTORY Split!! \u2013 Mar. 7, 2002 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=April 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040928072450/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=1962 |archive-date=September 28, 2004 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In April 2009, a new lineup was announced. Cazares returned as guitarist, and [[Gene Hoglan]] as drummer. Bell and Stroud reprised their respective roles, and this lineup recorded the band's seventh studio album titled ''[[Mechanize]]'' (2010). Former members Wolbers and [[Raymond Herrera]]\u2014both of whom were playing in [[Arkaea]]\u2014disputed the legitimacy of the new lineup, and a legal battle from both parties had begun. Despite this, Fear Factory has since released three more albums: ''[[The Industrialist]]'' (2012), ''[[Genexus (album)|Genexus]]'' (2015) and ''[[Aggression Continuum]]'' (2021).\n\nThe band has performed at four [[Ozzfest]]s and the inaugural [[Gigantour]]. Their singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200, and they have sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.burtoncbell.com/fear-factory/|title=Fear Factory|website=Burton C.

The name was inspired by a factory that the band supposedly saw near their rehearsal space which was guarded by men carrying rifles. Later, they shortened the name to just \"Fear Factory\".\n\nThe band's origins can be traced to an outfit formed by guitarist [[Dino Cazares]]\u2014formerly of ''The Douche Lords''\u2014and drummer [[Raymond Herrera]] in Los Angeles, California.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |author= Huey, Steve |url= {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p23420/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title= Fear Factory Biography |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= Allmusic}}</ref> Their first lineup was completed with the addition of bassist Dave Gibney and vocalist [[Burton C. Bell]] (ex-''Hate Face''<ref name=\"AMG\" />), who was allegedly recruited by an impressed Cazares, who overheard him singing \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\" by [[U2]].<ref name=\"FFF\">{{cite web |author1=Hook, James |author2=Maske, Douglas A. |author3=Rhoney, Stephen |url= http://www.fearfactoryfans.com/bio.php |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050205232828/http://www.fearfactoryfans.com/bio.php |archive-date= February 5, 2005 |title= Who is Fear Factory? |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= FearFactoryFans.com}}</ref><ref name=\"MVT\" /> Cazares played bass on the first three Fear Factory albums ''Concrete'', ''Soul of a New Machine'' and ''Demanufacture'', on which Cazares changed many of the riffs during the recording. It took Cazares two weeks to get the appropriate guitar tone. Cazares created, wrote and recorded all the music on the album. Wolbers joined the band two weeks before they were scheduled to go on tour to promote the album and, although he contributed musical changes to a couple of songs on the album he stated that these were not significant.\n\nFear Factory's earliest demo recordings are strongly reminiscent of the early works of [[Napalm Death]] and [[Godflesh]], an acknowledged influence of the band in the grindcore-driven approach of the former and the mechanical brutality, bleakness, and vocal stylings of the latter. According to Brian Russ of The BNR Metal Pages, the demos are remarkable for integrating these influences into the band's death metal sound and for Burton C. Bell's pioneering fusion of extreme [[death growl]]s and clean vocals in the same song, which was to become a significant and influential element of the band's sound throughout their career.<ref name=\"BNR\">{{cite web |author= Russ, Brian |url= http://www.bnrmetal.com/v3/band/band/FeFa |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120308113455/http://www.bnrmetal.com/v3/band/band/FeFa |url-status= dead |archive-date= March 8, 2012 |title= Fear Factory |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= BNR Productions }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2014}} The use of grunts and \"throat singing\" combined with clean vocals later defined the [[nu metal]] and other emerging subgenres of metal. Many vocalists in today's metal scene use two or more methods of singing and vocalizing lyrics. The band contributed two songs to the ''L.A. Death Metal Compilation'' in 1990.<ref name=\"AMG\" /> The band played its first show on October 31, 1990.\n\n===''Concrete'' (1991)===\n{{Main|Concrete (Fear Factory album)}}\n\nIn 1991, Fear Factory recorded a series of cuts with little-known producer [[Ross Robinson]], in [[Blackie Lawless]]'s studio. Afterward, the band members were unhappy with the terms of their recording contract, and they refused to sign. The band retained the rights to the songs, many of which they re-recorded in 1992 with a different producer, Colin Richardson, for inclusion on their debut release ''[[Soul of a New Machine]]''. Meanwhile, Ross Robinson obtained the rights to the recording, which he used to promote himself as a producer. The album was released in 2002 by [[Roadrunner Records]] under the title ''Concrete'' after the band's breakup. The release was controversial because the album was issued without the approval of Fear Factory.<ref name=\"MVT\">{{cite web |author= Purdie, Iain |url= http://www.moshville.co.uk/interview/2015/12/interview-burton-c-bell-of-fear-factory/ |title= Interview: Burton C Bell of Fear Factory |date= December 20, 2015 |access-date= December 24, 2015 |publisher= Moshville Times}}</ref> ''Concrete'' is viewed by the band as a demo; a developmental step toward ''Soul of a New Machine''.<ref name=\"MVT\" />\n\nFear Factory shopped the ''Concrete'' demo to various labels, and was rejected by a number of well-known metal record labels, such as [[Metal Blade Records|Metal Blade]], [[Earache Records|Earache]], [[Nuclear Blast]] and [[Peaceville Records]]. Eventually, after presenting the demo to [[Max Cavalera]], Max was so impressed that he recommended Fear Factory to [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative [[Monte Conner]], of the then-death-metal-focused Roadrunner Records label, which offered the band a recording contract.<ref name=\"FFF\" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Trapp |first=Philip TrappPhilip |title=Dino Cazares Recalls All the Metal Labels That Turned Down Fear Factory |url=https://loudwire.com/dino-cazares-fear-factory-labels-rejected-demo/ |access-date=2022-06-05 |website=Loudwire |language=en}}</ref> While the band signed the contract, it has since become controversial because of Roadrunner's treatment of the band during the events surrounding its 2002 breakup. This was reflected in the first album ''Archetype'' (2004), which was released following the band's re-formation. The opening song with lyrics by Burton C. Bell, \"Slave Labor\", was direct about the band's feelings on the matter. After working with numerous bassists, [[Andrew Shives]] was hired as a live bassist prior to the release of ''Soul of a New Machine''.\n\n===''Soul of a New Machine'' (1992\u20131994)===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n{{Main|Soul of a New Machine}}\n\n''Soul of a New Machine'' (1992), which was recorded with producer Colin Richardson, gave the band greater exposure in the music scene. The sound of the album presages the mixing of metal genres which would soon be called [[alternative metal]]. The production combined Bell's harsh and melodic vocals, Herrera's machine-like drums, the integrated industrial samples and textures and the sharp, down-tuned, rhythmic, death metal riffs of Dino Cazares. Cazares and Herrera wrote all the music. Because the band had no bass player, Cazares played both guitar and bass on the recording. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic called the album \"groundbreaking\" and said that \"it ushered in the '90s alternative metal era\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/soul-of-a-new-machine-mw0000112438|title=Soul of a New Machine \u2013 Fear Factory {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=October 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTo promote the album, Fear Factory embarked on extensive U.S. tours with [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], [[Sepultura]], and [[Sick of It All]]. During this period, sampler-keyboardist [[Reynor Diego]] joined the group. An album tour of Europe with [[Brutal Truth]], then [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], and [[Sleep (band)|Sleep]], followed. The next year, they hired [[Front Line Assembly]] member [[Rhys Fulber]] to remix some songs from the album, demonstrating the band's willingness to experiment with their music. The results took on a predominantly [[industrial music|industrial]] guise, and were released as the ''[[Fear Is the Mindkiller]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] (1993). ''Soul of a New Machine'' and ''Fear is the Mindkiller'' were released (2004) as a package in a new re-mastered reissue by Roadrunner Records.\n\nIn 1994, Andrew Shives was forced to leave the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fear-factory-mn0000167320/biography|title=Fear Factory {{!}} Biography & History|last=Huey|first=Steve|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=October 21, 2019}}</ref> Cazares recorded both the guitar and bass for the entire album. In November the same year, the band met Belgian Christian Olde Wolbers through [[Evan Seinfeld]] of Biohazard. Wolbers auditioned for Fear Factory's permanent bassist.<ref name=\"FFF\" /> Wolbers joined the band immediately since the band's tour was starting in two weeks.\n\n===''Demanufacture'' (1995\u20131997)===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\n{{Main|Demanufacture (album)}}\nIn June 1995, the band participated at the [[Dynamo Open Air]] festival in Netherlands.\n\nFear Factory's second album, ''Demanufacture'', was released on June 12. Generally considered to be the band's defining work, features an alternative metal sound<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/demanufacture-mw0000178307|title=Fear Factory - Demanufacture Album Reviews, Songs & More &#124; AllMusic|via=www.allmusic.com}}</ref> characterized by a mix of rapid-fire thrash metal/industrial metal guitar riffs and tight, pulse driven drum beats, roaring (rather than growled, but still aggressive) vocals that made way for melodic singing and powerful bass lines. The album's production is more refined and the integration of atmospheric keyboard parts and industrial textures upon Cazares' and Herrera's precise musicianship made the songs sound clinical, cold and machine-like and gave the band's music a futuristic feel. There were extensive contributions from Reynor Diego as well; adding key samples, loops and electronic flourishes to the group dynamics.\n\n''Demanufacture'' was awarded the maximum five-star rating in the UK's ''[[Kerrang!]]'' rock magazine. It went on to become a fairly successful album; whereas ''Soul of a New Machine'' failed to chart anywhere, ''Demanufacture'' made the Top 10 of the Billboard Heatseekers charts and a video was produced for the song \"Replica\". The video was featured in the ''[[Test Drive 5]]'' video game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The song \"Zero Signal\" was featured on the ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' film soundtrack (1995). Instrumental versions of ''Demanufacture'' songs were later used in [[Personal computer|PC]] video games ''[[Carmageddon]]'' and ''[[Messiah (video game)|Messiah]]''.\n\nFear Factory spent the next few years touring with such bands [[Black Sabbath]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Iron Maiden]], and opened for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] in North America and Europe during late 1995. They went on their first headlining European tour in mid-1996, with [[Manhole]] and [[Drain STH|Drain S.T.H.]] playing in clubs and music festivals, such as [[With Full Force]], W\u00e2ldrock or [[Graspop Metal Meeting]]. They also appeared at the [[Ozzfest]] in 1996 and 1997. In early 1997, they participated at the [[Big Day Out]] festival in Australia and New Zealand. In May 1997, the band released a new album composed of ''Demanufacture'' remixes by artists such as [[Rhys Fulber]], DJ Dano or [[Tom Holkenborg|Junkie XL]] called ''[[Remanufacture - Cloning Technology]]''. This was the band's first appearance on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Roadrunner Records re-released, in a 10th Anniversary single package, ''Demanufacture'' and ''Remanufacture'' in 2005, which is similar to that of ''Soul of a New Machine'' (2004). This edition also includes bonus tracks from the [[digipak]] version of ''Demanufacture'' (1995).\n\n===''Obsolete'' (1998\u20132000)===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n{{Main|Obsolete (album)}}\nFear Factory's third studio album, ''Obsolete'' (July 1998), was reportedly completed earlier than planned by canceling an appearance at the [[Dynamo Open Air Festival]].\n\n''Obsolete'' was similar in sound to ''Demanufacture'', emphasizing [[progressive metal]] elements.<ref name=\"Obsrev\">{{cite web |author= Prato, Greg |url= {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r366131|pure_url=yes}}\n |title= Obsolete Review |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= Allmusic}}</ref> For the first time, the album featured Christian Olde Wolbers writing and recording full time with the band. It also featured Cazares' debut use of 7-string Ibanez guitars tuned to A tuning (A, D, G, C, F, A, D), and paved the way for a lower-tuned sound than previously. The album is also notable for Rhys Fulber's increased involvement with the band.\n\nWhile Fear Factory had explored the theme of \"Man versus Machine\" in their earlier work, ''Obsolete'' was their first [[concept album]] that dealt specifically with a literal interpretation of this subject. It tells a story called ''Conception 5'', which was written by Bell, that takes place in a future world where mankind is rendered \"obsolete\" by machines. Its characters include the \"[[Edgecrusher]]\", \"Smasher/Devourer\", and the \"Securitron\" monitoring system. The story is presented in the lyrics booklet in a screenplay format between the individual songs. The printed story parts link the lyrics of the songs together thematically.\n\n''Obsolete'' was released during the alternative metal boom of the late 1990s. It was supported by tours with [[Slayer]] and later [[Rammstein]], and a headlining spot on the second stage at Ozzfest in 1999 as last-minute replacements for [[Judas Priest]]. They also toured in Europe in December 1998 with [[Spineshank]] and [[Kilgore (band)|Kilgore]], and went on their first headlining tour in North America with [[Static-X]] the next year, though the first leg was interrupted due to the band's tour bus and material being stolen. They also played in Japan for the first time. ''Obsolete'' became the band's highest selling album, marking the band's first entry into the Top 100 on the Billboard charts. The album also spawned singles \"[[Descent (song)|Descent]]\" and a [[digipak]] bonus track, \"[[Cars (song)|Cars]]\", a cover of the [[Gary Numan]] song featuring a guest appearance by Numan on the song. The single made the Mainstream Rock Top 40 in 1999 and was also featured in the video game, [[Test Drive 6]]. Numan also performed a spoken-word sample on the album's title track. A video was filmed for the song \"[[Resurrection (Fear Factory song)|Resurrection]]\". To date, ''Obsolete'' remains the only Fear Factory album to have achieved gold sales in the U.S.\n\n===''Digimortal'' and demise (2001\u20132002)===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n{{Main|Digimortal (album)}}\n\nIn early 2001, Fear Factory was asked to headline [[SnoCore Tour|SnoCore Rock]]. The success of ''Obsolete'' and \"Cars\" was a turning point for the band; Roadrunner Records was now keen on capitalizing on the band's sales potential and pressured the band to record more accessible material for the follow-up album, titled ''Digimortal'', which was released on April 23, 2001. Few weeks before its release, they were touring in Europe with [[One Minute Silence]].\n\nThey went on a long headlining North American tour during 2001, then played in much larger European festivals like Bizarre Festival, [[Pukkelpop]], [[Lowlands Festival]] and Leeds & Reading Festival. They then went on the first Roadrunner Roadrage tour in North America, toured Europe with [[Devin Townsend]] and [[Godflesh]] and played in Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n''Digimortal'' made the Top 40 on the Billboard album charts, the Top 20 in Canada and the Top 10 of the Australian album charts. The track \"[[Linchpin (song)|Linchpin]]\" reached the Mainstream Rock Top 40. A remix of \"Invisible Wounds\" was included on the ''[[Resident Evil (2002 film)|Resident Evil]]'' film soundtrack, and an instrumental digipak bonus track called \"Full Metal Contact\" was originally written for the video game, ''[[Demolition Racer]]''. A VHS/DVD release called ''[[Digital Connectivity]]'', which documents each of the four album periods of the band via interviews, live clips, music videos and tour/studio footage, was released in January 2002.\n\nAlthough ''Digimortal'' had a successful start, the sales did not reach the levels of ''Obsolete'' and the band received little tour support. The direction of the album coupled with strong personal differences between some of the band members created a rift that escalated to the point where Bell announced his exit in March 2002. The band disbanded immediately thereafter; its publicists said this was \"largely because vocalist Burton C. Bell is tired of playing angry, aggressive music and wants to form a band that's more indie-rock-oriented\". In a final collaboration, the group recorded two songs for the video game ''[[The Terminator: Dawn of Fate]]'' that month.<ref name=\"shuttingdown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452793/fear-factory-shutting-down.jhtml |title=Fear Factory Shutting Down |publisher=MTV |access-date=September 26, 2015}}</ref> Fear Factory's contractual obligations remained unfulfilled, however, and Roadrunner did not release them without controversially issuing the ''Concrete'' album in 2002 and the [[B-side]]s and rarities compilation, ''[[Hatefiles]]'', in 2003. During his time away from Fear Factory, Bell with John Bechdel started a side project called [[Ascension of the Watchers]], which released its first EP, ''Iconoclast'', independently via their online store in 2005.\n\n===First return and ''Archetype'' (2002\u20132004)===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n{{Quote box|width=25%|When you look up the definition of the word, Archetype, it's the actual model from which everything else is copied.

In the same interview, Herrera also revealed that Cazares had attempted to control the direction of the band by manipulating their business management and record company, and had openly lied to the other members about his actions.<ref>{{cite web|title=FEAR FACTORY's HERRERA: We're Better Off Without DINO CAZARES|date = May 2, 2003|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=11702|publisher=BlabberMouth}}</ref>\n\nHerrera and Olde Wolbers reunited later in 2002 and laid the foundations for the return of Fear Factory. Cazares was then permanently out of the band. Bell was approached with their demo recordings and was impressed enough to rejoin the band and Fear Factory was re-formed. Olde Wolbers switched to guitar and [[Byron Stroud]] of [[Strapping Young Lad]] was approached to join the band as a bassist. He was a member from 2003 until 2012. Cazares continued recording and performing with his side project called [[Asesino]], a Mexican [[deathgrind]] band. In 2007, he also started a new group called [[Divine Heresy]].\n\nFear Factory made its live return as the mystery band at the Australian [[Big Day Out]] festival in January 2004, followed by its first American shows since re-forming on the spring [[J\u00e4germeister]] tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Chimaira]]. The new lineup's first album ''[[Archetype (Fear Factory album)|Archetype]]'' was released on April 20, 2004, through new record label [[Liquid 8 Records]] based in [[Minnesota]]. With ''Archetype'', Fear Factory returned to an alternative, industrial, metal sound; the album is generally considered to be a strong 'return-to-form' record, if not a particularly innovative effort, with most of the trademark elements of the band firmly in place.\n\nVideos were shot for the songs \"[[Cyberwaste]]\", \"[[Archetype (Fear Factory song)|Archetype]]\", and \"Bite the Hand That Bleeds\"; the latter featured on the [[Saw (soundtrack)|''Saw'' film soundtrack]]. The band performed on further tours with [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] in the US and with [[Mnemic]] in Europe.

As a specific example, their debut album, ''[[Soul of a New Machine]]'', picked up its name directly from a line in a movie critic review of the ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' film (discussing the [[T-1000]] [[villain]]). Cazares has also cited recurring influences on Fear Factory coming from conventional [[popular music]], outside of the genres of hard rock and heavy metal, for instance looking to singer-songwriter [[Paul McCartney]]'s sounds in both [[The Beatles]] and [[Wings (band)|Wings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/dino_cazares_of_fear_factory/|title=Dino Cazares of Fear Factory : Songwriter Interviews|website=www.songfacts.com|access-date=July 18, 2017}}</ref> Over the years the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' has become a recurring theme as the band often makes lyrical reference to the plot, as well as directly quote and sample lines from the film.\n\nFear Factory's innovative approach towards and hybridization of the genres industrial metal, death metal, and alternative metal has had a lasting impact on other artists coming later, the band putting a stamp on metal music ever since the release of their first album in 1992. Fear Factory is noteworthy among contemporaries for its lyrical focus on science fiction, with much of the band's music telling a single story spanning several concept albums.
