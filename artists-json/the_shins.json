The band is the project of singer-songwriter [[James Mercer (musician)|James Mercer]], who has served as the band's sole constant member throughout numerous line-up changes. The band's current line-up consists of Mercer, alongside Yuuki Matthews (bass, keyboards), [[Mark Watrous]] (guitar, keyboards, lap steel), Patti King (keyboards), and [[Jon Sortland]] (drums).<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/70701-the-shins-announce-tour/|title=The Shins Announce Tour|last=Sodomsky|first=Sam|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=January 5, 2017|access-date=January 5, 2017}}</ref> They are based in [[Portland, Oregon]].\n\nThe band was formed by Mercer as a side project to [[Flake Music]], who were active from 1992 to 1999. Flake Music released two 7-inch singles and a full-length album, ''[[When You Land Here It's Time to Return]]'', on Omnibus Records and were touring with [[Modest Mouse]] when the Shins became signed to [[Sub Pop Records]]. The Shins' first two records, ''[[Oh, Inverted World]]'' (2001) and ''[[Chutes Too Narrow]]'' (2003), performed well commercially and received critical acclaim. The single \"[[New Slang]]\" brought the band to mainstream attention when it was featured in the 2004 film ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]''. Consequently, the band's third album, ''[[Wincing the Night Away]]'' (2007), was a major success for the group, peaking at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and earning a [[Grammy Award]] nomination.\n\nFollowing this, the Shins signed to [[Columbia Records]] and Mercer parted ways with the entire original lineup, deeming it \"an aesthetic decision\". Following a near five-year hiatus, ''[[Port of Morrow (album)|Port of Morrow]]'', the band's fourth studio album, was released in 2012. Their fifth album, ''[[Heartworms (album)|Heartworms]]'', was released in March 2017.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1996\u20132000)===\n[[File:Downtown Albuquerque Route 66.JPG|thumb|The Shins were formed in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].]]\nThe Shins was formed in 1996 by James Mercer, a member of the band Flake Music in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].
