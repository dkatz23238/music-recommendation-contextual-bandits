Costello also found time in 1979 to produce [[Specials (album)|the debut album]] of the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] ska revival band [[the Specials]] and worked as a backing vocalist on ''This Is Your Life'', an album by new wave band Twist.\n\nCostello's standing in the U.S. was bruised for a time when in March 1979, during a drunken argument with [[Stephen Stills]] and [[Bonnie Bramlett]] at a [[Holiday Inn]] bar in [[Columbus, Ohio]], the singer referred to [[James Brown]] as a \"jive-ass [[nigger]]\", then upped the ante by pronouncing [[Ray Charles]] a \"blind, ignorant nigger\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Greil |last=Marcus |title=In The Fascist Bathroom |year=1993 |work=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=0-14-014940-6 |page=229}}</ref> Costello addressed the controversy at a New York City press conference a few days later, stating that he had been drunk and had been attempting to be obnoxious to bring the conversation to a swift conclusion, not anticipating that Bramlett would bring his comments to the press. According to Costello, \"it became necessary for me to outrage these people with about the most obnoxious and offensive remarks that I could muster.\" In his liner notes for the expanded version of ''[[Get Happy!! (Elvis Costello album)|Get Happy!!]]'' Costello writes that some time after the incident he had declined an offer to meet Charles out of guilt and embarrassment, though Charles himself had forgiven Costello, saying \"Drunken talk isn't meant to be printed in the paper.\" Costello worked extensively in Britain's [[Rock Against Racism]] campaign both before and after the incident. In an interview with [[Questlove]] (drummer for [[the Roots]], whom Costello collaborated with in 2013), he stated: \"It's upsetting because I can't explain how I even got to think you could be funny about something like that\", and further elaborating with, \"I'm sorry. You know? It's about time I said it out loud.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Courtney E. |title=Elvis Costello Opens Up About 1979 Racial Slurs in Interview With ?uestlove |url=http://radio.com/2013/10/17/elvis-costello-opens-up-about-1979-racial-slurs-in-interview-with-uestlove/ |website=Radio.com |access-date=10 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916121400/http://radio.com/2013/10/17/elvis-costello-opens-up-about-1979-racial-slurs-in-interview-with-uestlove/ |archive-date=16 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCostello is also an avid country music fan and has cited [[George Jones]] as his favourite country singer. In 1977, he appeared on Jones' duet album ''[[My Very Special Guests]]'', contributing \"[[Stranger in the House (song)|Stranger in the House]]\", which they later performed together on an [[HBO]] special dedicated to Jones.\n\n===1980s===\nThe soul-infused ''Get Happy!!'' was the first of Costello's many experiments with genres beyond those with which he is ordinarily associated. It also marked a distinct change in mood from the angry, frustrated tone of his first three albums to a more upbeat, happy manner. The single, \"[[I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down]]\" was an old [[Sam and Dave]] song (though Costello increased the [[tempo]] considerably). Lyrically, the songs are full of Costello's signature word play, to the point that he later felt he had become something of a self-parody and toned it down on later releases; he has mockingly described himself in interviews as \"rock and roll's [[Scrabble]] champion\". His only 1980 appearance in North America was at the [[Heatwave (festival)|Heatwave]] festival in August near Toronto.\n\nIn January 1981, Costello released ''[[Trust (Elvis Costello album)|Trust]]'' amidst growing tensions within the Attractions, particularly between Bruce and Pete Thomas. In the U.S., the single \"Watch Your Step\" was released and played live on [[Tom Snyder]]'s ''Tomorrow'' show, and received airplay on FM rock radio. In the UK, the single \"[[Clubland (song)|Clubland]]\" scraped the lower reaches of the charts; follow-up single \"[[From a Whisper to a Scream (song)|From a Whisper to a Scream]]\" (a duet with [[Glenn Tilbrook]] of [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]]) became the first Costello single in over four years to completely miss the charts. Costello also co-produced Squeeze's popular 1981 album ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]'' (with [[Roger Bechirian]]) and performed backing vocals on the group's hit \"Tempted\".\n\nOctober saw the release of ''[[Almost Blue]]'', an album of country music cover songs written by the likes of [[Hank Williams]] (\"Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?)\"), [[Merle Haggard]] (\"Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down\") and [[Gram Parsons]] (\"How Much I Lied\"). The album, which received mixed reviews,<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/how-elvis-costello-outlined-his-future-with-almost-blue-120065/|title=How Elvis Costello Outlined His Future With 'Almost Blue'|first1=Will|last1=Hodge|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=21 October 2016|access-date=15 July 2019|archive-date=15 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715230013/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/how-elvis-costello-outlined-his-future-with-almost-blue-120065/|url-status=live}}</ref> was a tribute to the country music that Costello had grown up listening to, especially George Jones. The first pressings of the record in the UK bore a sticker with the message: \"WARNING: This album contains country & western music and may cause a radical reaction in narrow minded listeners.\" ''Almost Blue'' did spawn a surprise UK hit single in a version of George Jones' \"[[Good Year for the Roses]]\" (written by [[Jerry Chesnut]]), which reached No.&nbsp;6.\n\n''[[Imperial Bedroom]]'' (1982) had a much darker sound, due in part to the lavish production of [[Geoff Emerick]], famed for engineering several [[The Beatles|Beatles]] records. It remains one of his most critically acclaimed records, but again it failed to produce any hit singles\u2014\"[[You Little Fool]]\" and the critically acclaimed \"[[Man Out of Time]]\" both failed to reach the Top 40 in the UK. Costello has said he disliked the marketing pitch for the album. ''Imperial Bedroom'' also features Costello's song \"[[Almost Blue (song)|Almost Blue]]\", inspired by the music of jazz singer and trumpeter [[Chet Baker]], who would later perform and record a version of the song (on ''Chet Baker in Tokyo'').\n\nIn 1983, he released ''[[Punch the Clock]]'', featuring female backing vocal duo ([[Afrodiziak]]) and a four-piece horn section ([[the TKO Horns]]), alongside the Attractions. [[Clive Langer]] (who co-produced with Alan Winstanley), provided Costello with a melody which eventually became \"[[Shipbuilding (song)|Shipbuilding]]\", which featured a trumpet solo by Baker. Prior to the release of Costello's own version, a version of the song was a minor UK hit for former [[Soft Machine]] founder [[Robert Wyatt]].\n\nUnder the pseudonym The Imposter, Costello released \"Pills and Soap\", an attack on the changes in British society brought on by [[Thatcherism]], released to coincide with the run-up to the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 UK general election]]. ''Punch the Clock'' also generated an international hit in the single \"[[Everyday I Write the Book]]\", aided by a music video featuring lookalikes of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] undergoing domestic strife in a suburban home. The song became Costello's first [[Top 40]] hit single in the U.S. Also in the same year, Costello provided vocals on a version of the [[Madness (band)|Madness]] song \"Tomorrow's Just Another Day\" released as a [[B-side]].\n\nTensions within the band \u2013 notably between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas \u2013 were beginning to tell, and Costello announced his retirement and the break-up of the group shortly before they were to record ''[[Goodbye Cruel World (Elvis Costello album)|Goodbye Cruel World]]'' (1984). Costello would later say of this record that they had \"got it as wrong as you can in terms of the execution\". The record was poorly received upon its initial release; the liner notes to the 1995 [[Rykodisc]] re-release, penned by Costello, begin with the words \"Congratulations! You've just purchased our worst album\". Costello's retirement, although short-lived, was accompanied by two compilations, ''Elvis Costello: The Man'' in the UK, Europe and Australia, and ''[[The Best of Elvis Costello & The Attractions]]'' in the U.S.\n\nIn 1985, he appeared in the [[Live Aid]] benefit concert in England, singing the Beatles' \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" as a solo artist. (The event was overrunning and Costello was asked to \"ditch the band\".) Costello introduced the song as an \"old northern English folk song\", and the audience was invited to sing the chorus. In the same year Costello teamed up with friend [[T-Bone Burnett]] for the single \"The People's Limousine\" under the moniker of The Coward Brothers. That year, Costello also produced ''[[Rum Sodomy & the Lash]]'' for the Irish punk/folk band [[the Pogues]].\n\n1985 also saw Costello appear in the Alan Bleasdale film [[No Surrender (film)|''No Surrender'']], playing a small role as a very bad stage magician hired to perform at a seedy Liverpool night club on a bleak New Year's Eve.\n\nGrowing antipathy between Costello and Bruce Thomas contributed to the Attractions' first split in 1986 when Costello was preparing to make a comeback. Working in the U.S. with Burnett, a band containing a number of [[Elvis Presley]]'s sidemen (including [[James Burton]] and [[Jerry Scheff]]), and minor input from the Attractions, he produced ''[[King of America]]'', an acoustic guitar-driven album with a country sound. It was billed as performed by \"The Costello Show featuring the Attractions and Confederates\" in the UK and Europe and \"The Costello Show featuring Elvis Costello\" in North America. Around this time he legally changed his name back to Declan MacManus, adding Aloysius as an extra middle name. Costello retooled his upcoming tour to allow for multiple nights in each city, playing one night with the Confederates, one night with the Attractions, and one night solo acoustic. In May 1986, he performed at [[Self Aid]], a benefit concert held in [[Dublin]] that focused on the chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time.\n\nLater that year, Costello returned to the studio with the Attractions and recorded ''[[Blood & Chocolate]]'', which was lauded for a [[post-punk]] fervour not heard since 1978's ''This Year's Model''. It also marked the return of producer [[Nick Lowe]], who had produced Costello's first five albums. While ''Blood & Chocolate'' failed to chart a hit single of any significance, it did produce what has since become one of Costello's signature concert songs, \"[[I Want You (Elvis Costello song)|I Want You]]\". On this album, Costello adopted the alias Napoleon Dynamite, the name he later attributed to the character of the [[emcee]] that he played during the [[vaudeville]]-style tour to support ''Blood & Chocolate''. (The pseudonym had previously been used in 1982, when the B-side single \"Imperial Bedroom\" was credited to Napoleon Dynamite & the Royal Guard; whether the title of the 2004 film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' was inspired by Costello is disputed). After the tour for ''Blood & Chocolate'', Costello split from the Attractions, due mostly to tensions between Costello and Bruce Thomas. Costello would continue to work with Attraction Pete Thomas as a session musician for future releases.\n\nCostello's recording contract with Columbia Records ended after ''Blood & Chocolate''. In 1987 he released a compilation album, ''[[Out of Our Idiot]]'', on his UK label, [[Demon Records]] consisting of B-sides, side projects, and unreleased songs from recording sessions from 1980 to 1987. He signed a new contract with [[Warner Bros.]] and in early 1989 released ''[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]'', which spawned his biggest single in the U.S., the Top 20 hit \"[[Veronica (song)|Veronica]]\", one of several songs Costello co-wrote with [[Paul McCartney]]. At the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]] on 6 September in Los Angeles, \"Veronica\" won the MTV Award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video|Best Male Video]].<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/winners-by-category.jhtml 1989 MTV Video Music Awards: Video Vanguard Award] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629222913/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/winners-by-category.jhtml |date=29 June 2012 }} MTV.

He also co-composed and co-produced, with [[Richard Harvey]], the [[G.B.H. (soundtrack)|title and incidental music for the mini-series]] ''[[G.B.H. (TV series)|G.B.H.]]'' by [[Alan Bleasdale]]. This entirely instrumental, and largely orchestral, soundtrack garnered a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], for Best Music for a TV Series for the pair.\n\nIn 1993, Costello experimented with classical music with a critically acclaimed collaboration with the [[Brodsky Quartet]]<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Juliet Letters (review) |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |date=18 March 1993 |magazine=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-juliet-letters-19930318 |access-date=27 August 2017 |archive-date=30 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830045333/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-juliet-letters-19930318 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>1993 Review of \"The Juliet Letters\" by Bradley Smith. Retrieved May 2009{{dubious|date=July 2011|publication not listed, unverifiable}}</ref> on ''[[The Juliet Letters]]''. During this period, he wrote a full album's worth of material for [[Wendy James]], and these songs became the tracks on her 1993 solo album ''Now Ain't the Time for Your Tears''. Costello returned to rock and roll the following year with a project that reunited him with the Attractions, ''[[Brutal Youth]]''. In 1995, he released ''[[Kojak Variety]]'', an album of cover songs recorded five years earlier, and followed in 1996 with an album of songs originally written for other artists, ''[[All This Useless Beauty]]''. This was the final album of original material that he issued under his Warner Bros. contract, and also his final album with the Attractions.\n\nIn the spring of 1996, Costello played a series of intimate club dates, backed only by Steve Nieve on the piano, in support of ''All This Useless Beauty''. An ensuing summer and fall tour with the Attractions proved to be the death knell for the band. With relations between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas at a breaking point, Costello announced that the current tour would be the Attractions' last. The quartet performed their final U.S. show in [[Seattle]], Washington on 1 September 1996, before wrapping up their tour in Japan. Costello would still continue to work frequently with Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas; eventually, both would be members of Costello's new back-up band, The Imposters.\n\nTo fulfill his contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Costello released a greatest hits album titled ''[[Extreme Honey]]'' (1997). It contained an original track titled \"The Bridge I Burned\", featuring Costello's son, Matt, on bass. In the intervening period, Costello had served as artistic chair for the 1995 [[Meltdown Festival]], which gave him the opportunity to explore his increasingly eclectic musical interests. His involvement in the festival yielded a one-off live [[Extended play|EP]] with jazz guitarist [[Bill Frisell]], which featured both cover material and a few of his own songs.\n\nIn 1998, Costello signed a multi-label contract with [[Polygram Records]], sold by its parent company the same year to become part of the [[Universal Music Group]]. Costello released his new work on what he deemed the suitable imprimatur within the family of labels. His first new release as part of this contract involved a collaboration with [[Burt Bacharach]]. Their work had commenced earlier, in 1996, on a song called \"God Give Me Strength\" for the movie ''[[Grace of My Heart]]''. This led the pair to write and record the critically acclaimed album ''[[Painted From Memory]]'', released under his new contract in 1998, on the [[Mercury Records]] label, featuring songs that were largely inspired by the dissolution of his marriage to [[Cait O'Riordan]]. Costello and Bacharach performed several concerts with full orchestral backing, and also recorded an updated version of Bacharach's \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\" for the soundtrack to ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', with both appearing in the film to perform the song. He also wrote \"I Throw My Toys Around\" for ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'' and performed it with [[No Doubt]]. The same year, he collaborated with [[Paddy Moloney]] of [[The Chieftains]] on \"The Long Journey Home\" on the soundtrack of the [[PBS]]/[[Disney]] [[The Irish in America: Long Journey Home]] miniseries. The soundtrack won a [[Grammy]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=1999 Grammy Awards|magazine=Billboard|date=6 March 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Costello contributed a version of \"[[She (Charles Aznavour)|She]]\", released in 1974 by [[Charles Aznavour]] and [[Herbert Kretzmer]], for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'', with [[Trevor Jones (composer)|Trevor Jones]] producing. For the 25th anniversary of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', Costello was invited to the programme, where he re-enacted his abrupt song-switch: This time, however, he interrupted the [[Beastie Boys]]' \"Sabotage\", and they acted as his backing group for \"Radio Radio\".\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:Elvis Costello 15 June 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Costello performing at Glastonbury, 2005]]\n[[File:Elvis costello.jpg|thumb|Costello performing in 2006]]\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005, Costello re-issued his back catalogue in the U.S., from ''My Aim Is True'' (1977) to ''All This Useless Beauty'' (1996), on double-disc collections on the [[Rhino Records]] label. These releases, which each contained second discs of bonus material, ultimately fell out of print by 2007 after Universal Music acquired the rights to Costello's catalogue. Universal subsequently released new deluxe editions of ''My Aim Is True'' and ''This Year's Model'' with new bonus material of full-length concerts from the time of each album's release. These deluxe editions also fell out of print and Universal has reverted to re-releasing Costello's pre-1987 albums in their original context without bonus material.\n\nIn 2000, Costello appeared at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|the Town Hall]], New York, in Steve Nieve's opera ''[[Welcome to the Voice]]'', alongside [[Ron Sexsmith]] and [[John Flansburgh]] of [[They Might Be Giants]]. In 2001, Costello was artist-in-residence at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and wrote the music for a new ballet. He produced and appeared on an album of pop songs for the classical singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]]. He released the album ''[[When I Was Cruel]]'' in 2002 on [[Island Records]], and toured with a new band, the Imposters (essentially the Attractions but with a different bass player, [[Davey Faragher]], formerly of [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]]). He appeared as himself in the \"[[How I Spent My Strummer Vacation]]\" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crerar |first=Simon |title=The 33 funniest Simpsons cameos ever |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-33-funniest-simpsons-cameos-ever-vg9jgq67gxr |accessdate=2022-01-26 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=2007-07-05}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 February 2003, Costello, along with [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Steve Van Zandt]], and [[Dave Grohl]], performed a version of [[the Clash]]'s \"[[London Calling (song)|London Calling]]\" at the 45th Grammy Awards ceremony, in honour of Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]], who had died the previous December.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/17-bruce-springsteen-collaborations-from-chuck-berry-to-lada-gaga-20110124/london-calling-with-dave-grohl-and-elvis-costello-0751054 |title=Great Bruce Springsteen Collaborations: 'London Calling' With Dave Grohl and Elvis Costello |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=27 September 2015 |archive-date=29 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929054412/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/17-bruce-springsteen-collaborations-from-chuck-berry-to-lada-gaga-20110124/london-calling-with-dave-grohl-and-elvis-costello-0751054 |url-status=live }}</ref> In March, Elvis Costello & the Attractions were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

That September, he released ''[[North (Elvis Costello album)|North]]'', an album of piano-based ballads concerning the breakdown of his former marriage, and his falling in love with Krall. Also that year, Costello made an appearance in the television series ''[[Frasier]]'' as a folk singer in the Cafe Nervosa, sending Frasier and Niles on a search for a new coffee bar.<ref>[http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/frasier-farewell-nervosa/ \"''Frasier'': Farewell, Nervosa (2003)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923123151/http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/frasier-farewell-nervosa/ |date=23 September 2012 }}.

Costello co-wrote many songs on Krall's 2004 CD, ''[[The Girl in the Other Room]]'', the first of hers to feature several original compositions. In July 2004, Costello's first full-scale orchestral work, ''[[Il Sogno]]'', was performed in New York. The work, a ballet after [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', was commissioned by Italian dance troupe Aterballeto, and received critical acclaim from the classical music critics. Performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], the recording was released on CD in September by [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. In September 2004, Costello released the album ''[[The Delivery Man]]'', recorded in [[Oxford, Mississippi]], on [[Lost Highway Records]], and it was hailed as one of his best.\n\n[[File:Elvis Costello - European Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|left|Costello's hand prints on the European Walk of Fame, [[Rotterdam]]]]\nA CD recording of a collaboration with [[Marian McPartland]] on her show ''[[Piano Jazz]]'' was released in 2005. It featured Costello singing six jazz standards and two of his own songs, accompanied by McPartland on piano.

''[[The River in Reverse]]'' was released in the UK on the [[Verve Records|Verve]] label the following year in May.\n\nA 2005 tour included a gig at [[Glastonbury]] that Costello considered so dreadful that he said \"I don't care if I ever play England again.

The result was Costello's ''The River in Reverse'' which is a collaboration with New Orleanian, Allen Toussaint and recorded with The Crescent City Horns. Costello turned to older songs to reflect the national malaise at the time.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nIn a studio recording of Nieve's opera ''[[Welcome to the Voice]]'' (2006, Deutsche Grammophon), Costello interpreted the character of Chief of Police, with [[Barbara Bonney]], [[Robert Wyatt]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and Amanda Roocroft, and the album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the ''Billboard'' classical charts. Costello later reprised the piece on the stage of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in Paris in 2008, with Sting, [[Joe Sumner]] (Sting's son) and Sylvia Schwartz. Also released in 2006 was a live recording of a concert with the Metropole Orkest at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]], entitled ''My Flame Burns Blue''. The soundtrack for ''[[House (TV series)|House, M.D.]]'' featured Costello's interpretation of \"Beautiful\" by [[Christina Aguilera]], with the song appearing in the second episode of Season 2.\n\nCostello was commissioned to write a [[chamber opera]] by the Danish Royal Opera, [[Copenhagen]], on the subject of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s infatuation with Swedish soprano [[Jenny Lind]].
