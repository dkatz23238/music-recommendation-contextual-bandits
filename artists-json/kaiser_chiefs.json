Wilson elaborated further on the stark contrast between this last album and 'Stay Together': \"The thing about writing a protest album is it's straightforward. Only an idiot would disagree with you. You're just saying war is bad. But when you start talking about relationships like on this record it's harder because there\u2019s a lot more blurred line.

For the album the band reunited with [[Ben H. Allen]], the producer who worked on the band's 2014 album ''[[Education, Education, Education & War]]''. The album was preceded by a UK tour in January and February, including concerts at London's [[O2 Academy Brixton]] and [[O2 Academy Birmingham]], where several new songs from the album were premiered. The band also played a homecoming show at Elland Road in Leeds on 8 June 2019. Duck was later toured around arenas in the UK and Europe in early 2020.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Record Collection\", was released on 23 May 2019, with \"People Know How To Love One Another\" released as a second single on 6 June 2019. \"Golden Oldies\" was released as the third single in October 2019.\n\nThe name sparked interest with fans which was the opposite of what the band wanted. According to Wilson, they had always had trouble naming records so went with a random title suggested by White.\n\nAlthough the album entered at number three in the UK charts, it rapidly fell out of the list after only two weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/15414/kaiser-chiefs/ |title=Kaiser Chiefs |website=Official Charts|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2022, the band announced the single \"How 2 Dance\", which will be released on November 4th. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cj47VQgKWLx/ |title=Kaiser Chiefs |website=Instagram|access-date=19 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Other appearances==\nIn July 2005 they were chosen to open Bob Geldof's [[Live 8]] festival in [[Philadelphia]]; their performance was broadcast by satellite to every Live 8 venue around the world, giving the band massive worldwide exposure.\n\nIn August 2006, the band released a book entitled ''A Record of Employment'', which along with photos by Peter Hill, documented the band's rise from being unsigned to their triumph at the Brit Awards that year, where the band won awards for 'Best British Band','Best Rock Act' and 'Best New Artist'. Later a DVD entitled ''Enjoyment'', which documented concerts from the first album era was released, this showed members of the band hypothetically interviewed when 'jaded rock stars'.\n\nIn October 2008, they also appeared on MTV Day, in Greece, along with bands like the (Greek) C-Real, REM and the singer [[Gabriella Cilmi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvgreece.gr/article.php?id=2399&category_id=28 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110721083554/http://www.mtvgreece.gr/article.php?id=2399&category_id=28 |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 July 2011 |title=R.E.M, Kaiser Chiefs, C:Real & Gabriella Cilmi |publisher=MTVGreece.gr |access-date=21 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDuring an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, David Letterman spoke to Nick Hodgson about buying the Kaiser Chiefs drum set after a brief discussion between the pair an undisclosed price was agreed.
