They were signed to [[Island Records]] from 2001 to 2012 and have released six albums and one [[extended play]] to date.

Claims have included that it is a mispronunciation of a German street, slang for someone who owns many sneakers, or a word the band came up with while they were \"joking around.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2002-03-08-0203060887-story.html|title=SO WHAT, REALLY, IS A HOOBASTANK?|publisher=sun-sentinel.com |access-date=April 4, 2022}}</ref>\n\nHoobastank started playing gigs at the local venue [[Cobalt Cafe]] along with [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] and [[Linkin Park]]. They recorded their first full-length self-released album in 1998 called ''They Sure Don't Make Basketball Shorts Like They Used To'', which features a saxophone section headed by Jeremy Wasser, who executive produced the album and recorded the \"Summer Romance\" saxophone solo on [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]' ''[[S.C.I.E.N.C.E.]]'' album. The Incubus connections continued with Fourth Street Recording's music producer Jim Wirt and logos and visual design by Brett Spivey.\n\nBy this stage, Hoobastank had developed a strong reputation in Southern California. This attracted interest from [[Island Records]], who subsequently signed the band in 2000. At the time of signing, the band had completed a second full-length album, titled ''Forward'', also featuring Jeremy Wasser. However, the band felt that the direction they were heading in would work best without a sax, so Wasser departed the band and the album was shelved. A few tracks were rerecorded for release on the band's self-titled 2001 release. The original recordings from the ''Forward'' sessions made their way to the Internet via peer to peer sites in late 2001.\n\n===''Hoobastank'' (2001\u20132002)===\nHoobastank released its [[Hoobastank (album)|self-titled debut album]] in November 2001.

Also, the song was featured in the 2002 inline skating game, ''[[Aggressive Inline (video game)|Aggressive Inline]]'', appearing on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]] consoles. The second single \"[[Running Away]]\" was even more successful, reaching No.&nbsp;44 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, No.&nbsp;2 on the Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;9 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;3 on the MP3.com download chart. The ''Hoobastank'' album went Platinum due to these hit singles and reached No.&nbsp;25 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts and No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' Heatseeker chart.\n\nThe album achieved recognition internationally with the band touring in Europe and Asia in support of the record. \"[[Remember Me (Hoobastank song)|Remember Me]]\", the third single released from this album, was a moderate hit, reaching No.&nbsp;23 on the Modern Rock charts. The band made a song titled \"Losing My Grip\" for the soundtrack of the movie ''[[The Scorpion King]]''.\n\n===''The Reason'' (2003\u20132005)===\nIn early 2003, the group contributed the song \"Right Before Your Eyes\" to ''[[Daredevil: The Album]]''. The band then entered the studio with producer [[Howard Benson]]. Recording was disrupted for a month when Dan Estrin was seriously injured in a minibike accident in August. Estrin had recovered by October and the band headed off on a [[Nokia]] Unwired Tour with [[The All-American Rejects]] and [[Ozomatli]] in November.\n\nTheir second album ''[[The Reason (Hoobastank album)|The Reason]]'' was released in December 2003. The single \"Out of Control\" was made available for download on the band's website. Doug Robb said on the band's website: \"A lot of it is about asking questions or questioning all that people see. It's not all about religion. \"Out of Control\" is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by being devoted to anything.\" \"Same Direction\" would reach No.&nbsp;9 on the US Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;16 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;16 on a composite World Modern Rock chart (based on the US, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Australia). A year later, the ''[[Let It Out (DVD)|Let It Out]]'' DVD collected the band's videos. \"The Reason\" was put to a popular music video on [[tangle.com|Tangle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tangle.com/view_video.php?viewkey=acb74a48e2a0a871be96 |title=A reason to live - Today's Christian Videos |publisher=Tangle.com |access-date=October 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[The Reason (Hoobastank song)|title track]] was released as a single in the first half of 2004.

In Canada, it spent 21 weeks at the top, setting a new record for most weeks at No.&nbsp;1.  Meanwhile, in the United States, the album reached No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart.\n\nThe band's international profile was increased by a support slot on [[Linkin Park]]'s ''[[Meteora (album)|Meteora]]'' world tour in early 2004.\n\n===''Every Man for Himself'' (2006\u20132007)===\n[[File: US Navy 070123-N-2970T-005 Members of the band 'Hoobastank' sign autographs for fans after their concert at Fleet Activities Sasebo (CFAS).jpg|thumb|Hoobastank signing autographs for fans in 2007]]\n\nTheir third album ''[[Every Man for Himself (album)|Every Man for Himself]]'' was released in May 2006 and debuted at No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' chart.
