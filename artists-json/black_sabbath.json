They are often cited as pioneers of [[heavy metal music]].<ref name=\"Larson2004a\"/> The band helped define the genre with releases such as ''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'' (1970), ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (1970) and ''[[Master of Reality]]'' (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes following Osbourne's departure in 1979 and Iommi is the only constant member throughout their history.\n\nAfter previous iterations of the group \u2013 the Polka Tulk Blues Band and Earth \u2013 the band settled on the name Black Sabbath in 1969. They distinguished themselves through occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and [[down-tuned guitars]]. Signing to [[Philips Records]] in November 1969, they released their first single, \"[[Evil Woman (Crow song)|Evil Woman]]\", in January 1970, and their debut album, ''Black Sabbath'', was released the following month. Though it received a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success, leading to a follow-up record, ''Paranoid'', later that year. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's ''[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]'', critics were starting to respond favourably.\n\nOsbourne's excessive substance abuse led to his firing in 1979. He was replaced by former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]]. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured many personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists [[Ian Gillan]], [[Glenn Hughes (English musician)|Glenn Hughes]], [[Ray Gillen]] and [[Tony Martin (British singer)|Tony Martin]], as well as several drummers and bassists. Martin, who replaced Gillen in 1987, was the second-longest serving vocalist and recorded three albums with Black Sabbath before his dismissal in 1991. That same year, Iommi and Butler were rejoined by Dio and drummer [[Vinny Appice]] to record ''[[Dehumanizer]]'' (1992). After two more studio albums with Martin, who replaced Dio in 1993, the band's original line-up reunited in 1997 and released a live album, ''[[Reunion (Black Sabbath album)|Reunion]],'' the following year; they continued to tour occasionally until 2005. Other than various back catalogue reissues and compilation albums, as well as the ''[[Mob Rules (album)|Mob Rules]]''-era line-up reunited as [[Heaven & Hell (band)|Heaven & Hell]], there was no further activity under the Black Sabbath name for six years. They reunited in 2011 and released their final studio album and 19th overall, ''[[13 (Black Sabbath album)|13]]'', in 2013, which features all of the original members except Ward.

Pleased with the ''Vol. 4'' album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a \"giant synthesiser\". The band rented a house in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. \"Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on ''Vol. 4'', and we really got discontent\", Iommi said. \"Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something.

Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the U.S., exposing the band to a wider American audience. In the same year, the band shifted management, signing with notorious English manager [[Don Arden]]. The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath's former management, and while on stage in the U.S., Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation.{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=76}}\n\nBlack Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at [[Morgan Studios]] in [[Willesden]], this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from ''Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath''. \"We could've continued and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to.

To expand their sound, the band added keyboard player [[Gerald Woodroffe]], who also had appeared to a lesser extent on ''Sabotage''. During the recording of ''[[Technical Ecstasy]]'', Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" /> Recording of ''Technical Ecstasy'' was difficult; by the time the album was completed, Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" /> It was released on 25 September 1976 to mixed reviews, and \u2013 for the first time \u2013 later music critics gave the album less favourable retrospective reviews; two decades after its release, AllMusic gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was \"unravelling at an alarming rate\".<ref name=\"TE AMG Review\">{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/technical-ecstasy-mw0000197070|title=Technical Ecstasy \u2013 Review|website=AllMusic|access-date=9 February 2013}}</ref> The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. ''Technical Ecstasy'' failed to reach the top 50 in the U.S. and was the band's second consecutive release not to achieve Platinum status, although it was later certified Gold in 1997.<ref name=\"riaa\"/> The album included \"[[Dirty Women]]\", which remains a live staple, as well as Ward's first lead vocal on the song \"It's Alright\".<ref name=\"TE AMG Review\" /> Touring in support of ''Technical Ecstasy'' began in November 1976, with openers [[Boston (band)|Boston]] and [[Ted Nugent]] in the U.S., and completed in Europe with [[AC/DC]] in April 1977.<ref name=\"MusicMight\"/>\n\nIn late 1977, while in rehearsal for their next album and just days before the band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band.

If any recordings of this version of the band other than the \"Look! Hear!\" footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them.<ref name=\"walker_interview\" />\n\nOsbourne initially set out to form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. \"Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band\", Iommi explained. \"He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick\".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nThe band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, writing and recording what would become ''[[Never Say Die!]]''. \"It took quite a long time\", Iommi said. \"We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope.

It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the U.S.<ref name=\"riaa\"/>\n\nTouring in support of ''Never Say Die!'' began in May 1978 with openers [[Van Halen]]. Reviewers called Black Sabbath's performance \"tired and uninspired\", a stark contrast to the \"youthful\" performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time.<ref name=\"MusicMight\"/> The band filmed a performance at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as ''Never Say Die''. The final show of the tour \u2013 and Osbourne's last appearance with the band until later reunions \u2013 was in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], on 11 December.\n\nFollowing the tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne \"was on a totally different level altogether\".{{sfn|Iommi|2012}} The band would come up with new song ideas, but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them.{{sfn|Iommi|2012}} Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely.{{sfn|Iommi|2012}} \"At that time, Ozzy had come to an end\", Iommi said. \"We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time.

It just fizzled out\".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=95}} Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" /> \"I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually.

Don Arden was at this point still trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin the band, as he viewed the original line-up as the most profitable.{{sfn|Iommi|2012}} Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. \"They were totally different altogether\", Iommi explains. \"Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing ''across'' the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in \"Iron Man\". Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing.\"{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=98}}\n\nGeezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979 for personal reasons.
