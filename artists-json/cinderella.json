Her story is told in [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]'s ''Varia Storia'': lost her mother in early childhood and raised by her father, Aspasia, despite living in poverty, has dreamt of meeting a noble man. As she dozes off, the girl has a vision of a dove transforming into a woman, who instructs her on how to remove a physical imperfection and restore her own beauty. In another episode, she and other courtesans are made to attend a feast hosted by [[Persian people|Persian]] regent [[Cyrus the Younger]].

She is portrayed as an orphaned child in her early childhood. Before his death, her father gave her three magical objects: a chestnut, a nut and an almond. She used to work as a servant in the King's palace. Nobody ever took notice of the poor girl. One day she heard of a big ball and with the help of a magical spell turned herself into a beautiful princess. The prince fell in love with her and gave her a ring. On the following night the Prince gave her a diamond and on the third night he gave her a ring with a large gem on it. By the end of the ball \u010aiklemfusa would run away hiding herself in the cellars of the Palace. She knew that the Prince was very sad about her disappearance so one day she made some krustini (typical Maltese biscuits) for him and hid the three gifts in each of them. When the Prince ate the biscuits he found the gifts he had given to the mysterious Princess and soon realized the huge mistake he had made of ignoring \u010aiklemfusa because of her poor looks. They soon made marriage arrangements and she became his wife.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://education.gov.mt/en/nationalliteracyagency/PublishingImages/Pages/Resources/Rakkonti/\u010aeklemfusa%20-%20Rakkont.pdf|title=\u010aiklemfusa|website=Rakkonti|access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i34ZwXDNn1E| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/i34ZwXDNn1E| archive-date=2021-10-29|title=\u010aiklemfusa|website=Filmat mill-A\u0121enzija tal-Litteri\u017cmu|access-date=23 May 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/44340/1/Book_review_The_Maltese_Cindirella_and_the_Women%E2%80%99s_Storytelling_Tradition_2019.pdf|title= Book Review: The Maltese Cinderella and the Women's Storytelling Tradition (Veronica Veen)|journal=The Gozo Observer|number=39|date=2019|first=Anton F.|last=Attard}}</ref>\n\n===Outside Europe===\n====''Ye Xian''====\nThe tale of [[Ye Xian]] first appeared in ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' written by [[Duan Chengshi]] around 860.<ref name=Beauchamp>{{cite journal |url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/25ii/10_25.2.pdf |title=Asian Origins of Cinderella: The Zhuang Storyteller of Guangxi |journal=Oral Tradition |volume=25 |number=2 |first=Fay |last=Beauchamp |pages=447\u2013496 |access-date=25 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215135835/http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/25ii/10_25.2.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In this version, Ye Xian is the daughter of the local tribal leader who died when she was young.

The story itself was set in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], at that time the most important political and cultural center of [[Southern Italy]] and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the [[Neapolitan Language|Neapolitan dialect]]. It was later retold, along with other Basile tales, by [[Charles Perrault]] in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]'' (1697),<ref name=\"Bottigheimer, Ruth 2008 pp. 175\"/> and by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their folk tale collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' (1812).\n\nThe name \"Cenerentola\" comes from the Italian word \"cenere\" (ash, cinder). It has to do with the fact that servants and scullions were usually soiled with ash at that time, because of their cleaning work and also because they had to live in cold basements so they usually tried to get warm by sitting close to the fireplace.\n\n===''Cenerentola'', by Basile===\n[[Giambattista Basile]], a Neapolitan writer, soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled ''Lo cunto de li cunti'' (The Story of Stories), or ''[[Pentamerone]]''. It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a [[Absolute monarchy|monarch]] for the owner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634.\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A prince has a daughter, Zezolla (tonnie) (the Cinderella figure), who is tended by a beloved governess. The governess, with Zezolla's help, persuades the prince to marry her. The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla (tonnie), and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes to the island of Sinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her: a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king hosts a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is. Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants. The third time, the king's servant captures one of her slippers. The king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a shoe-test, identifies Zezolla (tonnie) after the shoe jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually marries her.<ref>Basile, Giambattista (1911).

The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of \"glass\" slippers.<ref>A modern edition of the original French text by Perrault is found in Charles Perrault, ''Contes'', ed. Marc Soriano (Paris: Flammarion, 1989), pp. 274\u201379.</ref>\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A wealthy widower has a beautiful young daughter, a girl of unparalleled kindness and sweet temper. The gentleman marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two [[false hero|daughters]], who are equally vain and selfish. The girl is forced into servitude by her stepmother, where she is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After the girl's chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in ashes, giving rise to the mocking nickname \"Cendrillon\" (Cinderella) by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her.\n:One day, the prince invites all the people in the land to a [[ball (dance)|royal ball]]. The two [[Ugly sisters|stepsisters]] gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids aren't invited to the ball.\n:As the two stepsisters and the stepmother depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her [[Fairy godmother]] magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a pumpkin into a golden [[carriage]], [[Mouse|mice]] into horses, a rat into a [[coachman]], and lizards into [[footman|footmen]]. She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Fairy Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before midnight, when the [[magic (paranormal)|spells]] will be broken.\n:At the ball, the entire [[noble court|court]] is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Fairy Godmother. She then innocently greets the two stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.\n:Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Fairy Godmother's help. The prince has become even more infatuated with the mysterious woman at the ball, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken.\n:The prince's herald tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the herald arrives at Cinderella's home, the two stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the two stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella's stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees. Cinderella had hoped her step-family would love her always. Cinderella marries the prince and forgives her two stepsisters, then marrying them off to two wealthy noblemen of the court. They all lived happily ever after.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The annotated classic fairy tales|date=2002|publisher=Norton|others=Tatar, Maria, 1945\u2013|isbn=0393051633|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=49894271}}</ref>\n\nThe first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless.

This version is much more violent than that of Charles Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father has not died and the two stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit in the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother in this version of the Brothers Grimm, but rather help comes from a wishing tree that the heroine planted on her deceased mother's grave when she recites a certain chant. In the second edition of their collection (1819), the Brothers Grimm supplemented the original 1812 version with a coda in which the two stepsisters suffer a bloody and terrible punishment, even worse than death, by the princess Cinderella, who can become very dangerous when she is angry, for their cruelty.<ref>Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm; Zipes, Jack; Desz\u00f6, Andrea. \"CINDERELLA\".

She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Ashfool\"). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.\n\nOne day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.\n\nThe king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.\n\n[[File:Cinderella by Elenore Abbott.jpg|thumb|right|Cinderella prays to the tree and the little birds provide her a beautiful dress. Art by Elenore Abbott.]]\nThe girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.\n\nThe next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a \"dirty little Cinderella\" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had won without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace. While passing the hazel tree the two magic doves from heaven declare Aschenputtel as the true bride of the prince, and remained on her shoulders, one on the left and the other on the right.\n\nIn a coda added in the second edition of 1819, during Aschenputtel's royal wedding, the false stepsisters had hoped to worm their way into her favour as the future queen, but this time they don't escape their princess' silent rage, which she kept to herself until that day, by not killing them. As she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, Aschenputtel's doves fly off her shoulders and strike the two stepsisters' eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. It is their [[Ultimatum|last chance]] of redemption, but since they are desperate to win the new princess' affections, they don't give up and go through the ceremony, so when the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her beloved prince march out of the church, her doves fly again, promptly striking the remaining eyes of the two evil stepsisters blind, a truly awful comeuppance they have to endure. Then, finally free from abuse and enslavement, Aschenputtel leaves her family forever to be a princess with her beloved prince, while the stepsisters live their lives as blind beggars, as her father and stepmother are in total disgrace.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19068/19068-h/19068-h.htm#illus-135 Aschenputtel], included in ''Household Stories'' by the Brothers Grimm, translated by Lucy Crane, at [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\n==Plot variations and alternative tellings==\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones Cinderella.jpg|thumb|''Cinderella'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], 1863, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]\nFolklorists have long studied variants on this tale across cultures.

In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]'', ''[[Catskin]]'', All-Kinds-of-Fur, and ''[[Allerleirauh]]'', and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there.<ref>Heidi Anne Heiner, \"[https://www.surlalunefairytales.com/a-g/donkeyskin/donkeyskin-related.html Tales Similar to Donkeyskin]\"</ref> In ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Katie Woodencloak (Norwegian Version of Cinderella)|date=5 April 2016|url=https://fairytalez.com/katie-woodencloak/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405205135/http://fairytalez.com/katie-woodencloak/ |archive-date=5 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', [[Gioachino Rossini]] inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is mistreated by her [[Stepfamily#stepfathers|stepfather]]. (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' [[dowry|dowries]] larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry. Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.<ref>[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p 213-4 {{ISBN|0-374-15901-7}}</ref>\n\nIn some retellings, at least one stepsister is somewhat kind to Cinderella and second guesses the Stepmother's treatment. This is seen in ''[[Ever After (film)|Ever After]]'', [[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True|the two]] [[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time|direct-to-video sequels]] to [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 film]], and [[Cinderella (2013 Broadway production)|the 2013 Broadway musical]].\n\n{{gallery\n|mode=packed\n|height=200\n|File:Thomas Sully - Cinderella at the Kitchen Fire - 2005.1 - Dallas Museum of Art.jpg|''Cinderella at the Kitchen Fire'', [[Thomas Sully]], 1843\n|File:Cinderella 1865 (2).png|The stepsisters, 1865 edition of Cinderella\n|File:Cinderella Dressing Her Sisters.png|Cinderella Dressing Her Sisters, ''Aunt Friendly's Gift'', 1890\n|File:Journeys through Bookland - a new and original plan for reading applied to the world's best literature for children (1922) (14780909344).jpg|Stepsisters from ''Journeys through Bookland'', 1922\n|File:Page facing 80 illustration from Fairy tales of Charles Perrault (Clarke, 1922).jpg|The stepsisters, illustration in ''The fairy tales of Charles Perrault'' by [[Harry Clarke]], 1922\n}}\n\n===Ball, ballgown, and curfew===\nThe number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three. The [[fairy godmother]] is Perrault's own addition to the tale.<ref>Jane Yolen, p 23, ''Touch Magic'' {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}</ref> The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]]'s version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as in the Finnish ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''. Playwright [[James Lapine]] incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical ''[[Into the Woods]]''. [[Giambattista Basile]]'s ''[[Cenerentola]]'' combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', ''[[Rushen Coatie]]'', ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'', ''[[The Story of Tam and Cam]]'', or ''[[The Sharp Grey Sheep]]''\u2014these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in ''[[The Golden Slipper]]'', a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In \"The Anklet\", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. [[Gioachino Rossini]], having agreed to do an opera based on ''Cinderella'' if he could omit all magical elements, wrote ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.\n\nThe midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.<ref>Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 116 W.

In Rossini's opera \"''[[La Cenerentola]]''\" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'' the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers. Some interpreters, perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's \"glass slipper\" (''pantoufle de verre'') had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (''pantoufle de [[vair]]'') in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 28, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref> {{efn|Glass Slippers, \u2014An article hitherto only used to adorn the foot of Cinderella in a fairy tale, may now be seen in that extensive repository of discoveries and improvements, the [[Polytechnic Institution]], Regent-street.

(Throughout the pantomime, the Baron is continually harassed by the Broker's Men (often named after current politicians) for outstanding rent. The Fairy Godmother must magically create a coach (from a pumpkin), footmen (from mice), a coach driver (from a frog), and a beautiful dress (from rags) for Cinderella to go to the ball.

This is partly based on the Grimm Brothers' version of \"Cinderella\", including the enchanted birds, mother's grave, three balls, and mutilation and blinding of the stepsisters. It opened on Broadway in 1987 and has had many revivals. In this film, Cinderella is actually the Baker's ex-sister-in-law, since she married her prince and her prince's brother married Rapunzel, and the baker is Rapunzel's brother. After she divorced the prince she became Rapunzel and the Baker's ex-sister-in-law.\n*''[[Cinderella (Lloyd Webber musical)|Cinderella]]'' is a musical composed by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] that premiered in the West End in 2021.\n\n===Films and television===\nOver the decades, hundreds of films have been made that are either direct adaptations from Cinderella or have plots loosely based on the story.\n\n====Animation====\n[[File:Betty Boop - Poor Cinderella (1934) - HD.webm|thumb|thumbtime=15|[[Betty Boop]] as Cinderella in the 1934 animation ''[[Poor Cinderella]]'']]\n*''Aschenputtel'' (1922), a [[Silhouette animation|silhouette shadow play]] short by [[Lotte Reiniger]].
