Produced by Amos, the album explores topics like American politics and environmental issues, mixed with mythological elements and first-person narrations.\n\nThe initial inspiration for the album came from a trip that Amos took to the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] (Tennessee-North Carolina), home of her alleged Native American ancestors; however, two events deeply influenced the final record: in November 2016, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States of America; two months later, in January 2017, Amos's mother, Mary Ellen, had a stroke that left her unable to speak. Shocked by both events, Amos spent the first half of 2017 writing and recording the songs that would eventually form ''Native Invader''. The album, released on September 8, 2017, was presented in two formats: standard and deluxe. The standard version includes 13 songs, while the deluxe edition adds two extra songs to the tracklist: \"Upside Down 2\" and \"Russia\".

Her concerts are notable for their changing set lists from night to night.\n\n'''Little Earthquakes Tour'''\n: Amos's first world tour began on January 29, 1992, in London and ended on November 30, 1992, in [[Auckland]].

Amos performed solo each night on her iconic [[B\u00f6sendorfer]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} piano, and on a [[prepared piano]] during \"Bells for Her\". The tour included 181 concerts.\n\n'''Dew Drop Inn Tour'''\n: The third world tour began on February 23, 1996, in [[Ipswich]], England, and ended on November 11, 1996, in [[Boulder]]. Amos performed each night on piano, [[harpsichord]], and [[Pump organ|harmonium]], with [[Steve Caton]] on guitar on some songs. The tour included 187 concerts.\n\n'''Plugged '98 Tour'''\n: Amos's first band tour. Amos, on piano and [[Kurzweil Music Systems|Kurzweil]] keyboard, was joined by [[Steve Caton]] on guitar, [[Matt Chamberlain]] on drums, and Jon Evans on bass. The tour began on April 18, 1998, in [[Fort Lauderdale]] and ended on December 3, 1998, in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], including 137 concerts. Highlights from the tour were included on the live disc of ''To Venus and Back''.\n\n'''[[5 \u00bd Weeks Tour]] / To Dallas and Back'''\n: Amos's fifth tour was North America\u2013only. The first part of the tour was co-headlining with [[Alanis Morissette]] and featured the same band and equipment line-up as in 1998. Amos and the band continued for eight shows before Amos embarked on a series of solo shows. The tour began on August 18, 1999, in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], and ended on December 9, 1999, in [[Denver]], including 46 concerts.\n\n'''Strange Little Tour'''\n: This tour was Amos's first since becoming a mother in 2000 and her first tour fully solo since 1994 ([[Steve Caton]] was present on some songs in 1996). It saw Amos perform on piano, [[Rhodes piano]], and [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], and though the tour was in support of her covers album, the set lists were not strictly covers-oriented. Having brought her one-year-old daughter on the road with her, this tour was also one of Amos's shortest ventures, lasting just three months. It began on August 30, 2001, in London and ended on December 17, 2001, in [[Milan]], including 55 concerts.\n\n'''On Scarlet's Walk / Lottapianos Tour'''\n: Amos's seventh tour saw her reunited with [[Matt Chamberlain]] and Jon Evans, but not [[Steve Caton]]. The first part of the tour, which featured Amos on piano, Kurzweil, Rhodes, and Wurlitzer, was six months long and Amos went out again in the summer of 2003 for a tour with [[Ben Folds]] opening. The tour began on November 7, 2002, in [[Tampa]] and ended on September 4, 2003, in [[West Palm Beach]], featuring 124 concerts. The final show of the tour was filmed and released as part of a DVD/CD set titled ''[[Welcome to Sunny Florida]]'' (the set also included a studio EP titled ''[[Scarlet's Hidden Treasures]]'', an extension of the ''[[Scarlet's Walk]]'' album).\n\n'''Original Sinsuality Tour / Summer of Sin'''\n: This tour began on April 1, 2005, in [[Clearwater, Florida]], with Amos on piano, two [[Hammond organ|Hammond B-3]] organs, and Rhodes. The tour also encompassed Australia for the first time since 1994. Amos announced at a concert on this tour that she would never stop touring but would scale down the tours. Amos returned to the road in August and September for the Summer of Sin North America leg, ending on September 17, 2005, in Los Angeles. The tour featured \"Tori's Piano Bar\", where fans could nominate cover songs on Amos's website which she would then choose from to play in a special section of each show. One of the songs chosen was the [[Kylie Minogue]] hit \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\", which Amos dedicated to her the day after Minogue's breast cancer was announced to the public. Other songs performed by Amos include [[The Doors]]' \"People are Strange\", [[Depeche Mode]]'s \"Personal Jesus\", [[Joni Mitchell]]'s \"[[The Circle Game (song)|The Circle Game]]\", [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[Live to Tell]]\" and \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\", [[Bj\u00f6rk]]'s \"[[Hyperballad]]\", [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[When the Levee Breaks]]\" (which she debuted in Austin, Texas, just after the events of Hurricane Katrina), [[Kate Bush]]'s \"And Dream of Sheep\" and [[Crowded House]]'s \"Don't Dream It's Over\", dedicating it to drummer Paul Hester who had died a week before. The entire concert tour featured 82 concerts, and six full-length concerts were released as ''[[The Original Bootlegs]]''.\n\n'''American Doll Posse World Tour'''\n: This was Amos's first tour with a full band since her 1999 Five and a Half Weeks Tour, accompanied by long-time bandmates Jon Evans and Matt Chamberlain, with guitarist Dan Phelps rounding out Amos's new band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://undented.com/news/707/the-tour-has-begun |title=Undented |website=Undented |date=May 28, 2007 |access-date=October 14, 2009}}</ref> Amos's equipment included her piano, a Hammond B-3 organ, and two Yamaha S90 ES keyboards. The tour kicked off with its European leg in Rome, Italy, on May 28, 2007, which lasted through July, concluding in [[Israel]]; the Australian leg took place during September; the North American leg lasted from October to December 16, 2007, when the tour concluded in Los Angeles. Amos opened each show dressed as one of the four non-Tori personae from the album, then Amos would emerge as herself to perform for the remaining two-thirds of the show. The entire concert tour featured 93 concerts, and 27 full-length concerts of the North American tour were released as official bootlegs in the ''[[Legs and Boots]]'' series.\n\n'''Sinful Attraction Tour'''\n: For her tenth tour, Amos returned to the trio format of her 2002 and 2003 tours with bassist Jon Evans and drummer Matt Chamberlain while expanding her lineup of keyboards by adding three [[M-Audio]] MIDI controllers to her ensemble of her piano, a Hammond B-3 organ, and a Yamaha S90 ES keyboard. The North American and European band tour began on July 10, 2009, in [[Seattle]], Washington, and ended in [[Warsaw]] on October 10, 2009. A solo leg through Australia began in [[Melbourne]] on November 12, 2009, and ended in [[Brisbane]] on November 24, 2009.
