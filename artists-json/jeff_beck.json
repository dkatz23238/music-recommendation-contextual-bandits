Other\" and contributed lead guitar on four songs, including one co-written by him. In September 1969, he teamed with the rhythm section of [[Vanilla Fudge]]: bassist [[Tim Bogert]] and drummer [[Carmine Appice]] (when they were in England to resolve contractual issues), but when Beck fractured his skull in a car accident near Maidstone in December the plan was postponed for two and a half years, during which time Bogert and Appice formed [[Cactus (American band)|Cactus]]. Beck later remarked on the 1960s period of his life: \"Everyone thinks of the 1960s as something they really weren't. It was the frustration period of my life. The electronic equipment just wasn't up to the sounds I had in my head.\"{{sfn|Heslam|1992|p=292}}\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1970, when Beck had regained his health, he set about forming a band with drummer [[Cozy Powell]]. Beck, Powell and producer [[Mickie Most]] flew to the United States and recorded several tracks at [[Motown]]'s famed Studio A in Hitsville U.S.A. with [[the Funk Brothers]], Motown's in-house band, but the results remained unreleased. By April 1971 Beck had completed the line-up of this new group with guitarist/vocalist [[Bobby Tench]], keyboard player [[Max Middleton]] and bassist [[Clive Chaman]]. The new band performed as \"the Jeff Beck Group\" but had a substantially different sound from the first line-up.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n''[[Rough and Ready (album)|Rough and Ready]]'' (October 1971), the first album they recorded, on which Beck wrote or co-wrote six of the album's seven tracks (the exception being written by Middleton), included elements of soul, rhythm-and-blues and jazz, foreshadowing the direction Beck's music would take later in the decade.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:Early Jeff Beck.jpg|thumb|200px|Beck playing in 1973]]\nA second album ''[[Jeff Beck Group (album)|Jeff Beck Group]]'' (July 1972) was recorded at TMI studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] with the same personnel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Graves|first=Tom|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/jeff-beck-group-mw0000649876|title=Jeff Beck Group Review|website=AllMusic|access-date=14 February 2009}}</ref> Beck employed [[Steve Cropper]] as producer{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=115}} and the album displayed a strong [[Soul music|soul]] influence, five of the nine tracks being covers of songs by American artists. One, \"I Got to Have a Song\", was the first of four [[Stevie Wonder]] compositions covered by Beck. Shortly after the release of the ''Jeff Beck Group'' album, the band was dissolved and Beck's management put out the statement that: \"The fusion of the musical styles of the various members has been successful within the terms of individual musicians, but they didn't feel it had led to the creation of a new musical style with the strength they had originally sought.\"{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=122}}\n\nBeck then started collaborating with bassist [[Tim Bogert]] and drummer [[Carmine Appice]], who became available following the demise of [[Cactus (American band)|Cactus]] but continued touring as the Jeff Beck Group in August 1972, to fulfill contractual obligations with his promoter, with a line-up including Bogert, Appice, [[Max Middleton]] and vocalist [[Kim Milford]]. After six appearances Milford was replaced by [[Bobby Tench]], who was flown in from the UK{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=123}} for the ''Arie Crown Theatre'' Chicago performance and the rest of the tour,{{sfn|Joynson|1998|p=415}} which concluded at the [[Paramount Theatre (Seattle, Washington)|Paramount North West Theatre, Seattle]]. After the tour Tench and Middleton left the band and the [[power trio]] [[Beck, Bogert & Appice]] emerged. Appice took on the role of vocalist with Bogert and Beck contributing occasionally.{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=124}}\n\nThey were included on the bill for ''Rock at The Oval'' in September 1972, still as \"the Jeff Beck Group,\" which marked the start of a tour schedule of UK, the Netherlands and Germany. Another U.S. tour began in October 1972, starting at the [[Hollywood Sportatorium]] Florida and concluding on 11 November 1972 at The Warehouse, [[New Orleans]].{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|pp=125\u2013131}} In April 1973 the album ''[[Beck, Bogert & Appice (album)|Beck, Bogert & Appice]]'' was released (on Epic Records). While critics acknowledged the band's instrumental prowess the album was not commercially well received except for its cover of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s hit \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\".\n\nOn 3 July 1973 Beck joined [[David Bowie]] onstage to perform \"[[The Jean Genie]]\"/\"[[Love Me Do]]\" and \"[[Around and Around]].\" The show was recorded and filmed, but none of the released editions included Beck. During October 1973 Beck recorded tracks for [[Michael Fennelly (musician)|Michael Fennelly]]'s<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p17485|pure_url=yes}}|author=Thomas, Bryan|title=Michael Fennelly|publisher=allmusic.com| access-date=31 July 2009}}</ref> album ''Lane Changer'' and attended sessions with [[Hummingbird (band)|Hummingbird]], a band derived from the Jeff Beck Group, but did not to contribute to their [[eponymous]] first album.{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=146}}\n\nEarly in January 1974 [[Beck, Bogert & Appice]] played at the [[Rainbow Theatre (Finsbury Park)|Rainbow Theatre]], as part of a European tour.

This last recorded work by the band previewed material intended for a second studio album, included on the bootleg ''At Last Rainbow''.

Their live album ''[[Live in Japan (Beck, Bogert & Appice album)|Beck, Bogert & Appice Live in Japan]]'', recorded during their 1973 tour of Japan, was not released until February 1975 by Epic/Sony.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAfter a few months Beck entered Underhill Studio and met with the group [[Upp (band)|Upp]], whom he recruited as backing band for his appearance on the BBC TV programme ''Guitar Workshop'' in August 1974. Beck produced and played on their self-titled debut album and their second album ''This Way Upp'', though his contributions to the second album went uncredited. In October Beck began to record instrumentals at [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios]] with [[Max Middleton]], bassist [[Phil Chen]] and drummer Richard Bailey, using [[George Martin]] as producer and arranger.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nJeff Beck's solo album ''[[Blow by Blow]]'' (March 1975) evolved from these sessions and showcased Beck's technical prowess in jazz-rock. The album reached number four in the charts and is Beck's most commercially successful release. Beck, fastidious about [[Overdubbing|overdubs]] and often dissatisfied with his solos, often returned to AIR Studios until he was satisfied. A couple of months after the sessions had finished producer George Martin received a telephone call from Beck, who wanted to record a solo section again. Bemused, Martin replied: \"I'm sorry, Jeff, but the record is in the shops!\"{{sfn|Foster|Cunningham|2000|pp=13, 119, 120, 315}}\n[[File:Jeff Beck in Amsterdam 1979.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Beck performing in Amsterdam; 1979]]\nBeck put together a live band for a US tour, preceded by a small and unannounced gig at The Newlands Tavern in Peckham, London. He toured through April and May 1975, mostly supporting the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], retaining Max Middleton on keyboards but with a new [[rhythm section]] of bassist [[Wilbur Bascomb]] and noted session drummer [[Bernard Purdie|Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie]].\n\nIn a May 1975 show in Cleveland, Ohio (Music Hall), he became frustrated with an early version of a [[talk box]] he used on his arrangement of the Beatles' \"[[She's a Woman]]\", and after breaking a string, tossed his legendary Yardbirds-era [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] guitar off the stage. He did the same with the talk box and finished the show playing a Les Paul and without the box. During this tour he performed at [[Yuya Uchida (singer)|Yuya Uchida]]'s \"World Rock Festival\", playing a total of eight songs with Purdie. In addition he performed a guitar and drum instrumental with Johnny Yoshinaga and, at the end of the festival, joined in a live jam with bassist [[Felix Pappalardi]] of [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] and vocalist [[Joe Yamanaka|Akira \"Joe\" Yamanaka]] from the [[Flower Travellin' Band]]. Only his set with Purdie was recorded and released.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nHe returned to the studio and recorded ''[[Wired (Jeff Beck album)|Wired]]'' (1976), which paired ex-[[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] drummer and composer [[Narada Michael Walden]] and keyboardist [[Jan Hammer]]. The album used a jazz-rock fusion style, which sounded similar to the work of his two collaborators. To promote the album, Beck joined forces with the [[Jan Hammer|Jan Hammer Group]], playing a show supporting [[Alvin Lee]] at [[The Roundhouse]] in May 1976, before embarking on a seven-month-long world tour. This resulted in the live album ''[[Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group Live]]'' (1977).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAt this point, Beck was a [[tax exile]] and took up residency in the US, remaining there until his return to the UK in the autumn of 1977. In the spring of 1978, he began rehearsing with ex-[[Return to Forever]] bassist [[Stanley Clarke]] and drummer [[Gerry Brown (drummer)|Gerry Brown]] towards a projected appearance at the Knebworth Festival, but this was cancelled after Brown dropped out. Beck toured Japan for three weeks in November 1978 with an ad hoc group consisting of Clarke and newcomers [[Tony Hymas]] (keyboards) and [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] (drums) from [[Jack Bruce]]'s band.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nWork then began on a new studio album at [[the Who]]'s [[Ramport Studios]] in London and continued sporadically throughout 1979, resulting in ''[[There & Back (Jeff Beck album)|There & Back]]'' in June 1980. It featured three tracks composed and recorded with Jan Hammer, while five were written with Hymas. Stanley Clarke was replaced by [[Mo Foster]] on bass, both on the album and the subsequent tours.
