When designing the poster for the performance, Baez considered changing her performing name to either Rachel Sandperl, the surname of her longtime mentor [[Ira Sandperl]], or Maria from the song \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\". She later opted against doing so, fearing that people would accuse her of changing her last name because it was Spanish.

The collection of traditional folk [[Ballad (music)|ballads]], blues, and [[lament]]s sung to her own guitar accompaniment sold moderately well.

''The Daily Progress''.</ref>\n     \nHer second release, ''[[Joan Baez, Vol. 2]]'' (1961), went \"[[Music recording sales certification|gold]]\", as did ''[[Joan Baez in Concert]], Part 1'' (1962) and ''[[Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2]]'' (1963). Like its immediate predecessor, ''Joan Baez, Vol. 2'' contained strictly traditional material. Her two albums of live material, ''Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1'' and its second counterpart were unique in that unlike most live albums, they contained only new songs rather than established favorites. It was ''Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2'' that featured Baez's first-ever Dylan cover.\n\nFrom the early to mid 1960s, Baez emerged at the forefront of the American [[roots revival]], where she introduced her audiences to the then-unknown [[Bob Dylan]] and was emulated by artists such as [[Judy Collins]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Bonnie Raitt]]. On November 23, 1962, Baez appeared on the cover of ''Time Magazine''\u2014a rare honor then for a musician.\n\nThough primarily an album artist, several of Baez's singles have charted, the first being her 1965 cover of [[Phil Ochs]]' \"There but for Fortune\", which became a mid-level chart hit in the U.S. and a top-ten single in the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Joan_Baez_1966.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Baez in 1966]]\nBaez added other instruments to her recordings on ''[[Farewell, Angelina]]'' (1965), which features several Dylan songs interspersed with more traditional fare.\n\n[[File:Joan_Baez_(1966).jpg|thumb|upright|Baez in 1966 at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam airport]]]]\nDeciding to experiment with different styles, Baez turned to [[Peter Schickele]], a classical music composer, who provided classical orchestration for her next three albums: ''[[No\u00ebl (Joan Baez album)|No\u00ebl]]'' (1966), ''[[Joan (album)|Joan]]'' (1967), and ''[[Baptism: A Journey Through Our Time]]'' (1968). ''No\u00ebl'' was a Christmas album of traditional material, while ''Baptism'' was akin to a [[concept album]], featuring Baez reading and singing poems written by celebrated poets such as [[James Joyce]], [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], and [[Walt Whitman]]. ''Joan'' featured interpretations of work by then-contemporary composers, including [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], [[Tim Hardin]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Donovan]].\n\nIn 1968, Baez traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where a marathon recording session resulted in two albums. The first, ''[[Any Day Now (Joan Baez album)|Any Day Now]]'' (1968), consists exclusively of Dylan covers. The other, the country-music-infused ''[[David's Album]]'' (1969), was recorded for then-husband [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]], a prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] protester eventually imprisoned for [[draft resistance]]. Harris, a country music fan, turned Baez toward more complex [[country rock|country-rock]] influences beginning with ''David's Album''.\n\nLater in 1968, Baez published her first memoir, ''Daybreak'' (by [[Dial Press]]). In August 1969, her appearance at [[Woodstock]] in upstate New York raised her international musical and political profile, particularly after the successful release of the documentary film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1970).\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, Baez began writing many of her own songs, beginning with \"Sweet Sir Galahad\" and \"A Song For David\", both songs appearing on her 1970 ''[[(I Live) One Day at a Time]]'' album; \"Sweet Sir Galahad\" was written about her sister Mimi's second marriage, while \"A Song For David\" was a tribute to Harris. ''One Day at a Time'', like ''David's Album'', featured a decidedly country sound.\n\nBaez's distinctive vocal style and political activism had a significant impact on American popular music. She was one of the first musicians to use her popularity as a vehicle for social protest, singing and marching for human rights and peace. [[Pete Seeger]], [[Odetta]], and decades-long friend [[Harry Belafonte]] were her early social justice advocate influences.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/joan-baez-9195061|title=Joan Baez|website=Biography.com|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> Baez came to be considered the \"most accomplished interpretive folksinger/songwriter of the 1960s\".<ref name = Baez1941>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3830.html Joan Baez].

She delivered Vanguard one last success with the gold-selling album ''[[Blessed Are...]]'' (1971), which included a top-ten hit in \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\", her cover of [[The Band]]'s signature song. With ''[[Come from the Shadows]]'' (1972), Baez switched to [[A&M Records]], where she remained for four years and six albums.\n\nJoan Baez wrote \"The Story of Bangladesh\" in 1971.

The two songs were issued as a single on [[Decca Records|Decca]] (32890). In addition to this, another LP was released on Decca (DL 7-9188) and was later reissued by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on black (STV-81072) and green (VC-81072) vinyl. In 1998, a limited release on CD by the \"Valley Forge Record Groupe\" was released.\n\nBaez's first album for A&M, ''[[Come from the Shadows]]'', was recorded in Nashville, and included a number of more personal compositions, including \"Love Song to a Stranger\" and \"Myths\", as well as work by Mimi Farina, John Lennon, and Anna Marly.\n\n''[[Where Are You Now, My Son?]]'' (1973) featured a 23-minute title song which took up all of the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the album. Half [[spoken word]] poem and half tape-recorded sounds, the song documented Baez's visit to [[Hanoi]], [[North Vietnam]], in December 1972 during which she and her traveling companions survived the 11-day-long [[Christmas Bombings]] campaign over Hanoi and [[Haiphong]].<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2002/12/26/joan_baez Democracy Now, December 26, 2002] (audio).

It included the song \"[[Cucurrucuc\u00fa paloma]]\". Flirting with mainstream pop music as well as writing her own songs for ''[[Diamonds & Rust]]'' (1975), the album became the highest selling of Baez's career and included a second top-ten single in the form of the title track.\n\nAfter ''[[Gulf Winds]]'' (1976), an album of entirely self-composed songs and ''[[From Every Stage]]'' (1976), a live album that had Baez performing songs \"from every stage\" of her career, Baez again parted ways with a record label when she moved to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] for ''[[Blowin' Away]]'' (1977) and ''[[Honest Lullaby]]'' (1979).\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nIn 1980, Baez was given honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degrees by [[Antioch University]] and [[Rutgers University]] for her political activism and the \"universality of her music\". In 1983, she appeared on the [[Grammy Awards]], performing Dylan's anthemic \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\", a song she first performed twenty years earlier.\n\n[[File:Dylan-Baez-Santana.jpg|thumb|right | alt=On stage outdoors, Dylan in a leather jacket and iconic porkpie hat & scarf, Baez wears a peasant skirt, sarape, tassled scarf around neck, her arm around Dylan's shoulder.

She has toured on behalf of many other causes, including [[Amnesty International]]'s 1986 ''[[A Conspiracy of Hope]]'' tour and a guest spot on their subsequent ''[[Human Rights Now!]]'' tour.\n\nBaez found herself without an American label for the release of ''[[Live -Europe '83|Live Europe 83]]'' (1984), which was released in Europe and Canada but not released commercially in the U.S. She did not have an American release until the album ''[[Recently (album)|Recently]]'' (1987) on [[Gold Castle Records]].\n\nIn 1987, Baez's second autobiography, called ''And a Voice to Sing With'', was published and became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]]. That same year, she traveled to the Middle East to visit with and sing songs of peace for Israel and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]].\n\nIn May 1989, Baez performed at a music festival in [[communism|communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]] called Bratislavsk\u00e1 l\u00fdra. While there, she met future [[List of Presidents of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak president]] [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], whom she let carry her guitar so as to prevent his arrest by government agents. During her performance, she greeted members of [[Charter 77]], a dissident human-rights group, which resulted in her microphone being shut off abruptly. Baez then proceeded to sing ''[[a cappella]]'' for the nearly four thousand gathered. Havel cited her as a great inspiration and influence in that country's [[Velvet Revolution]], the revolution in which the Soviet-dominated Communist government there was overthrown.\n\nBaez recorded two more albums with Gold Castle: ''[[Speaking of Dreams]]'', (1989) and ''[[Brothers in Arms (Joan Baez album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' (1991). She then landed a contract with a major label, [[Virgin Records]], recording ''[[Play Me Backwards]]'' (1992) for Virgin shortly before the company was purchased by [[EMI]]. She then switched to Guardian, with whom she produced a live album, ''[[Ring Them Bells]]'' (1995), and a studio album, ''[[Gone from Danger]]'' (1997).\n\nIn 1993, at the invitation of [[Refugees International]] and sponsored by the [[Soros Foundation]], she traveled to the war-torn [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] region of former-[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in an effort to help bring more attention to the suffering there. She was the first major artist to perform in [[Sarajevo]] since the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav civil war]].\n\nIn October of that year, Baez became the first major artist to perform in a professional concert presentation on [[Alcatraz Island]] (a former [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|U.S. federal prison]]) in San Francisco, California, in a benefit for her sister Mimi's Bread and Roses organization. She later returned for another concert in 1996.\n\n===2000s===\nBeginning in 2001, Baez has had several successful long-term engagements as a lead character at San Francisco's [[Teatro ZinZanni]].<ref name=\"BaezSFChron\">{{cite web |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/12/DD231448.DTL |title= Now it's Countess Baez |first= Steve|last= Winn |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date= October 12, 2001 }}</ref> In August 2001, Vanguard began re-releasing Baez's first 13 albums, which she recorded for the label between 1960 and 1971.

Then, on January 13, 2006, Baez performed at the funeral of [[Lou Rawls]], where she led [[Jesse Jackson]], Sr., Wonder, and others in the singing of \"[[Amazing Grace]]\". On June 6, 2006, Baez joined [[Bruce Springsteen]] on stage at his San Francisco concert, where the two performed the rolling anthem \"[[Pay Me My Money Down]]\". In September 2006, Baez contributed a live, retooled version of her classic song \"Sweet Sir Galahad\" to a [[Starbucks]]'s exclusive XM Artist Confidential album. In the new version, she changed the lyric \"here's to the dawn of their days\" to \"here's to the dawn of ''her'' days\", as a tribute to her late sister Mimi, about whom Baez wrote the song in 1969. Later on, October 8, 2006, she appeared as a special surprise guest at the opening ceremony of the [[Forum 2000]] international conference in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. Her performance was kept secret from former [[President of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic President]] Havel until the moment she appeared on stage. Havel was a great admirer of both Baez and her work. During Baez's next visit to Prague, in April 2007, the two met again when she performed in front of a sold-out house at Prague's [[Lucerna Music Bar#Lucerna Palace|Lucerna Hall]], a building erected by Havel's grandfather. On December 2, 2006, she made a guest appearance at the [[Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir]]'s Christmas Concert at the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Oakland]], California.

At the time, Baez had already released her debut album and her popularity as the emerging \"Queen of Folk\" was on the rise. Baez was initially unimpressed with the \"urban [[hillbilly]]\", but was impressed with one of Dylan's first compositions, \"[[Song to Woody]]\" and remarked that she would like to record it.\n\nBy 1963, Baez had already released three albums, two of which had been certified gold, and she invited Dylan on stage to perform alongside her at the Newport Folk Festival. The two performed the Dylan composition \"[[With God on Our Side (song)|With God on Our Side]]\", a performance that set the stage for many more duets like it in the months and years to come. Typically while on tour, Baez would invite Dylan to sing on stage partly by himself and partly with her, much to the chagrin of her fans.<ref name=\"American Masters\" />\n\nBefore meeting Dylan, Baez's topical songs were very few: \"[[Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream]]\", \"We Shall Overcome\", and an assortment of [[Negro spirituals]]. Baez would later say that Dylan's songs seemed to update the topics of protest and justice.\n\nBy the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the UK, their relationship had slowly begun to fizzle out. The couple are captured in [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s documentary film ''[[Dont Look Back]]''<!-- {{sic}} --> (1967).\n\nBaez toured with Dylan as a performer on his [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] in 1975\u201376. She sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue]]'', released in 2002. Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special ''Hard Rain'', filmed at [[Fort Collins]], [[Colorado]], in May 1976. Baez also starred as 'The Woman in White' in the film ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'' (1978), directed by Bob Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue. They performed together at the Peace Sunday anti-nuke concert in 1982.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/flashback-bob-dylan-and-joan-baez-cover-jimmy-buffet-in-1982-229823/|title=Flashback: Bob Dylan, Joan Baez Cover Jimmy Buffet in 1982|first1=Andy|last1=Greene|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 5, 2016|access-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref> Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 along with [[Carlos Santana]].\n\nBaez discussed her relationship with Dylan in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s documentary film ''[[No Direction Home]]'' (2005), and in the PBS ''[[American Masters]]'' biography of Baez, ''How Sweet the Sound'' (2009).\n\nBaez wrote and composed at least three songs that were specifically about Dylan. In \"To Bobby\", written in 1972, she urged Dylan to return to political activism, while in \"[[Diamonds & Rust (song)|Diamonds & Rust]]\", the title track from [[Diamonds & Rust|her 1975 album]], she revisited her feelings for him in warm, yet direct terms.<ref name = Gray>{{cite book | last = Gray | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Gray (author) | title = The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia | publisher = The Continuum International Publishing Group | location = London | year = 2006 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/bobdylanencyclop00gray/page/30 30\u201331] | isbn = 978-0-8264-6933-5 | url = https://archive.org/details/bobdylanencyclop00gray/page/30 }}</ref> \"[[Winds of the Old Days (song)|Winds of the Old Days]]\", also on the ''Diamonds & Rust'' album, is a bittersweet reminiscence about her time with \"Bobby\".\n\nThe references to Baez in Dylan's songs are far less clear.

As for \"[[Like A Rolling Stone]]\", \"Visions of Johanna\", \"[[She Belongs to Me]]\", and other songs alleged to have been written about Baez, neither Dylan nor biographers such as [[Clinton Heylin]] and [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] have had anything definitive to say either way regarding the subject of these songs.\n\n===David Harris===\nIn October 1967, Baez, her mother and nearly 70 other women were arrested at the Oakland, California, Armed Forces Induction Center for blocking its doorways to prevent entrance by young inductees, and in support of young men who refused [[conscription|military induction]]. They were incarcerated in the [[Santa Rita Jail]], and it was here that Baez met [[David Harris (protestor)|David Harris]], who was kept on the men's side but who still managed to visit with Baez regularly.\n\nThe two formed a close bond upon their release and Baez moved into his draft-resistance [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] in the hills above [[Stanford, California]]. The pair had known each other for three months when they decided to wed. After confirming the news to Associated Press, media outlets began dedicating ample press to the impending nuptials (at one point, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine referred to the event as the \"Wedding of the Century\").{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\nAfter finding a [[pacifist]] preacher and a church outfitted with peace signs and writing a blend of [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] and [[Quaker wedding]] vows, Baez and Harris married in New York City on March 26, 1968. Her friend [[Judy Collins]] sang at the ceremony. After the wedding, Baez and Harris moved into a home in the Los Altos Hills on {{convert|10|acre|hectare}} of land called Struggle Mountain, part of a commune, where they tended gardens and were strict vegetarians.\n\nA short time later, Harris refused induction into the armed forces and was indicted. On July 16, 1969, Harris was taken by federal marshals to prison.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901123,00.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081214140634/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901123,00.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = December 14, 2008 | title = People: July 25, 1969 | publisher  = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date =  July 25, 1969 | access-date = June 18, 2010}}</ref><!-- leaving Baez alone -- not alone at all, on that commune, according to the article. --> Baez was visibly pregnant in public in the months that followed, most notably at the [[Woodstock]] Festival, where she performed a handful of songs in the early morning.
