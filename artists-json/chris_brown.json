The multitude of genres influencing his music can be heard in many of his singles, like \"[[Deuces (song)|Deuces]]\", \"[[Sweet Love (Chris Brown song)|Sweet Love]]\", \"[[Liquor (song)|Liquor]]\", \"[[Zero (Chris Brown song)|Zero]]\", \"[[Back to Love (Chris Brown song)|Back to Love]]\" or \"[[Don't Check on Me]]\".

His [[dance-pop]] side in the single \"[[Forever (Chris Brown song)|Forever]]\" off his second album ''Exclusive'' opened the door for many other [[Europop]] songs like \"[[Yeah 3x]]\", \"[[Beautiful People (Chris Brown song)|Beautiful People]]\", \"[[Turn Up the Music (Chris Brown song)|Turn Up The Music]]\" and \"[[Don't Wake Me Up (Chris Brown song)|Don't Wake Me Up]]\", but it begun to be less present in his music starting from his album ''[[X (Chris Brown album)|X]]''.<ref name=\"apnews.com\">{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/c50de9d46932477eb90a32e63da323d4|title = Chris Brown's 45-song album not the skip-fest you'd expect|website = [[Associated Press]]|date = November 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Themes====\nBrown's lyrical production is typically considered to be \"emotional\" or \"hedonistic\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/2902467/chris-brown-my-friend-new-song/|title=Chris Brown's Emotional New Song Is For 'Anybody Dealing With Injustice'|first=Madeline|last=Roth|website=MTV News|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.capitalgazette.com/la-et-ms-chris-brown-royalty-r-kelly-the-buffet-review-20151218-story.html|title=On new albums, Chris Brown and R.
