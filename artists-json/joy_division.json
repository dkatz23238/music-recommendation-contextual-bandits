See WP:ENGVAR.--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Salford]] in 1976. The group consisted of vocalist [[Ian Curtis]], guitarist/keyboardist [[Bernard Sumner]], bassist [[Peter Hook]] and drummer [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]].\n\nSumner and Hook formed the band after attending a June 1976 [[Sex Pistols]] concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early [[punk rock|punk]], they soon developed a sparse sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the [[post-punk]] movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP ''[[An Ideal for Living]]'' drew the attention of the Manchester television personality [[Tony Wilson]], who signed them to his independent label [[Factory Records]]. Their debut album ''[[Unknown Pleasures]]'', recorded with producer [[Martin Hannett]], was released in 1979.\n\nFrontman Curtis struggled with personal problems including a failing marriage, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[epilepsy]]. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's health condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced [[generalised tonic-clonic seizure|seizure]]s on stage. He died by suicide on the eve of what would have been the band's first North American tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, ''[[Closer (Joy Division album)|Closer]]'', was released two months later; it and the single \"[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]\" became their highest-charting releases.\n\nBetween July and October 1980 the remaining members regrouped under the name [[New Order (band)|New Order]]. They were successful throughout the next decade, blending post-punk with [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[dance music]] influences.<ref name=\"Ankeny\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/new-order-mn0000334193/biography |title=New Order: Biography |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=20 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation ===\nOn 4 June 1976,<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/sex-pistols-free-trade-manchester-11423565 |title=Four Manchester bands we owe to the Sex Pistols' Lesser Free Trade Hall gig 40 years ago |date=3 June 2016 |publisher=Manchester Evening News |access-date=4 June 2020}}</ref> childhood friends [[Bernard Sumner]] and [[Peter Hook]] separately attended a [[Sex Pistols]] show at the [[Free Trade Hall|Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall]].

He wrote; \"I was like, head in hands, 'Oh fucking hell, it's happening again ... Martin had fucking melted the guitar with his [[Marshall Time Modulator|Marshall Time Waster]].

He was also anxious about how American audiences would react to his epilepsy.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=117}}\n\nThe evening before the band were due to depart for America, Curtis returned to his Macclesfield home to talk to Deborah.

Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as fairly generic and \"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\". Critic [[Simon Reynolds]] observed how the band's originality only \"really became apparent as the songs got slower\", and their music took on a \"sparse\" quality. According to Reynolds, \"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris's drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=110}} According to music critic Jon Savage, \"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\".{{sfn|Curtis|1995|loc=\"Foreword\"}} In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers.

Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, \"He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian\".{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=75}} During the recording sessions for ''Closer'', Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=116}}\n\nProducer Martin Hannett \"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=112}} The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\".<ref name=\"Mojo 1994\"/> Hannett demanded clean and clear \"sound separation\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound\".{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=113}} Music journalist [[Richard Cook (journalist)|Richard Cook]] noted that Hannett's role was \"crucial\". There are \"devices of distance\" in his production and \"the sound is an illusion of physicality\".<ref name=\"Cook\">{{cite magazine |last=Cook |first=Richard |date=24 December 1983 |title=Cries & Whispers |magazine=[[NME]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Lyrics ===\nCurtis was the band's sole lyricist, and he typically composed his lyrics in a notebook, independently of the eventual music to evolve.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=74}} The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group [[Jam session|jammed]] during rehearsals.

They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like.\"{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=75}} The other Joy Division members have said that at the time, they paid little attention to the contents of Curtis's lyrics.<ref name=\"Lester\"/> In a 1987 interview with ''[[Option (music magazine)|Option]]'', Morris said that they \"just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Woodard |first=Josef |date=November 1987 |title=Out from the Shadows: New Order |magazine=[[Option (music magazine)|Option]]}}</ref> Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of ''Closer'' did many who were close to the singer realise \"[h]is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics\".{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=139}} The surviving members regret not seeing the warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. Morris said that \"it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics...you'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?'

The band were especially unhappy with Hannett's mix of ''Unknown Pleasures'', which reduced the abrasiveness of their live sound for a more cerebral and ghostly sound. According to Sumner \"the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars\".<ref name=\"Mojo 1994\"/>\n\nDuring their live performances, the group did not interact with the audience; according to Paul Morley, \"During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear more than two or three words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Morley |first=Paul |author-link=Paul Morley |date=16 February 1980 |title=Simply the First Division |magazine=NME}}</ref> Curtis would often perform what became known as his \"'dead fly' dance\", as if imitating a seizure; his arms would \"start flying in [a] semicircular, hypnotic curve\".<ref name=\"Mojo 1994\"/> Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic seizure, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=115}} Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, \"We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit.
