The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]], lead guitarist [[Ray Toro]], rhythm guitarist [[Frank Iero]], and bassist [[Mikey Way]]. They are considered one of the most influential rock groups of the [[2000s in music|2000s]] and a major act in the [[pop-punk]] and [[emo]] genres, despite the band rejecting the latter label.\n\nFounded on September 12, 2001 by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, and drummer Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed with [[Eyeball Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love]]'', in 2002. They signed with [[Reprise Records]] the next year and released their major-label debut, ''[[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]]'', in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by [[Bob Bryar]]. The album was a commercial success, and it attained platinum status over a year later.\n\nThe success of the band's previous albums was eclipsed by that of their 2006 [[rock opera]] [[concept album]], ''[[The Black Parade]]'', which was a major commercial success, with lead single \"[[Welcome to the Black Parade]]\" topping the UK singles chart. The album solidified the band's following, despite negative coverage in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' generating controversy. The band's fourth studio album, ''[[Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys]]'', was released in 2010. Bryar departed the band prior to the release of the album, and in 2012, they added touring keyboardist [[James Dewees]]. In 2012 and 2013, the band released a series of singles they had recorded in 2009 under the collective title ''[[Conventional Weapons]]''. My Chemical Romance announced its breakup on March 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mychemicalromance.com/news/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709010453/http://www.mychemicalromance.com/news/ |archive-date=2013-07-09 |title=News &#124; My Chemical Romance |access-date=2014-07-27}}</ref> In 2014, a [[greatest hits album]] titled ''[[May Death Never Stop You]]'' was released<ref name=\"kerrang1\">[http://www.kerrang.com/blog/2013/12/my_chemical_romance_greatest_hits.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219015000/http://www.kerrang.com/blog/2013/12/my_chemical_romance_greatest_hits.html |date=December 19, 2013 }}</ref> and a [[The Black Parade/Living with Ghosts|tenth-anniversary reissue of ''The Black Parade'']] was released in 2016.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, the band announced a reunion show, which took place in [[Los Angeles]] on December 20, 2019.<ref name=\"pitchfork.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/my-chemical-romance-announce-reunion-show/|title=My Chemical Romance Announce Reunion Show|website=Pitchfork|date=October 31, 2019|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31|archive-date=October 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031193423/https://pitchfork.com/news/my-chemical-romance-announce-reunion-show/|url-status=live}}</ref> In January 2020, they announced additional shows and a [[My Chemical Romance Reunion Tour|Reunion Tour]], which commenced in 2022 after a two-year postponement due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].\n\n<!-- For upcoming tours, see 'Tours' section below. --><!-- Music style and legacy -->\n==History==\n===Early career and ''I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love'' (2001\u20132002)===\n{{Main|I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love}}\n[[File:WTC smoking on 9-11.jpeg|thumb|Witnessing the [[September 11 attacks]] influenced Way to form My Chemical Romance.]]\nThe band was formed by frontman [[Gerard Way]] and drummer Matt Pelissier in [[Newark, New Jersey]], soon after the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/my-chemical-romance-mn0000520545|title=My Chemical Romance|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=March 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302144145/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/my-chemical-romance-mn0000520545|url-status=live}}</ref> Witnessing the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers fall influenced Way's life to the extent that he decided to start a band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wow.cl/prontus_wow/site/artic/20080223/pags/20080223211406.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313074511/http://www.wow.cl/prontus_wow/site/artic/20080223/pags/20080223211406.html|title=Press conference held in Chile|date=February 2008|access-date=December 18, 2013|archive-date=March 13, 2008}}</ref> Way has said \"music was this thing I secretly wanted to do\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrCUEY8rgPE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119101211/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrCUEY8rgPE|archive-date=January 19, 2021|title=My Chemical Romance: Question and Answer Interview|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=December 4, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and later wrote the song \"Skylines and Turnstiles\" to express his feelings about September 11 and shortly thereafter, [[Ray Toro]] was recruited as the band's guitarist because at the time Way could not sing and play the [[guitar]] simultaneously.<ref name=\"alt press\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theimmortalityproject.com/fansite/press/apnov04.html |title=Art Imitates Life \u2013 My Chemical Romance |access-date=2006-12-23 |publisher=Alternative Press |year=2004 |author=Simon, Leslie |work=Alternative Press Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128135648/http://www.theimmortalityproject.com/fansite/press/apnov04.html |archive-date=November 28, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe name of the band was suggested by bass guitarist [[Mikey Way]], younger brother of Gerard, who was working in a [[Barnes & Noble]] when he was struck by the title of a book by [[Irvine Welsh]] named ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/8181/11-things-didnt-know-chemical-romance/|title=11 Things You Didn't know about My Chemical Romance|work=Kerrang!|access-date=March 7, 2016|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305162551/http://www.kerrang.com/8181/11-things-didnt-know-chemical-romance/|url-status=live}}</ref> The first recording sessions were undertaken in Pelissier's attic, where the songs \"Our Lady of Sorrows\" and \"Cubicles\" were recorded.

After initial crowd hostility, it became clear the band was simply performing under a pseudonym in keeping with the theme of the album. Since then, the band would often perform under the alias \"The Black Parade\", wearing the costumes seen in the album's music videos.
