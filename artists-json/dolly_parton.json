After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]'', which led to success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), before her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records. She has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.\n\nParton's music includes [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach no.{{nbs}}1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with [[Reba McEntire]]). She has 44 career Top{{nbs}}10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career-charted singles over the past 40 years. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\", \"[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9{{nbs}}to{{nbs}}5]]\". As an actress, she has starred in films such as ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9{{nbs}}to{{nbs}}5]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), for which she earned [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], as well as ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' (1984), ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' (1989), ''[[Straight Talk]]'' (1992) and ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' (2012).\n\nShe has garnered 11 [[Grammy Awards]] and 50 nominations, including the Lifetime Achievement Award; ten [[Country Music Association]] Awards, including Entertainer of the Year and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award; five [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], also including Entertainer of the Year; four [[People's Choice Awards]]; and three [[American Music Awards]]. She is also in [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|a select group]] to have received at least one nomination from the [[Academy Awards]], Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]]. In 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In 2022, she was nominated for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], she initially declined the nomination, but ultimately accepted it; the Hall of Fame later announced that Parton will be inducted.\n\nOutside of her work in the music industry, she also co-owns [[The Dollywood Company]], which manages a number of entertainment venues, including the [[Dollywood]] theme park, the [[Dollywood's Splash Country|Splash Country]] water park, and a number of [[dinner theatre]] venues including The Dolly Parton Stampede and Pirates Voyage.  She has founded a number of charitable and philanthropic organizations, chief among which is the [[Dollywood Foundation]], which manages a number of projects to bring education and poverty relief to [[East Tennessee]] where she grew up.\n\n==Early life and career==\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]] in [[Pittman Center, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Schmidt|editor-first=Randy L. |title=Dolly on Dolly: interviews and encounters with Dolly Parton|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2017 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRB0DQAAQBAJ |isbn=978-1-61373-519-0 |quote=But if you want to know the names of some hollers and some ridges and some knobs where I lived, I was born at Pittman Center on Pittman Center Road. }}</ref> \nShe is the fourth of twelve children born to Avie Lee Caroline ([[Maiden and married names|n\u00e9e]] Owens; 1923\u20132003) and Robert Lee Parton Sr. (1921\u20132000).

Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique, high [[soprano]] voice was not suited to the genre.\n\nAfter her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\", as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy\", which went to number 17.

As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|magazine=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s \"[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]\", released in late 1967, reached the country Top{{nbs}}10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted Top{{nbs}}10 singles for the pair.\n\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]\", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17.

The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored.

Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated.

During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again''{{'s}} release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher...

Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top{{nbs}}10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had twelve Top{{nbs}}10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of \"I Will Always Love You\", from the feature film ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982) scraped the Top{{nbs}}50 that year and her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" (written by the [[Bee Gees]] and produced by [[Barry Gibb]]), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with \"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\", \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\", \"[[Tennessee Homesick Blues]]\" (1984), \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), \"[[Don't Call It Love]]\" (1985) and \"[[Think About Love]]\" (1986) all reaching the country Top{{nbs}}10 (\"Tennessee Homesick Blues\" and \"Think About Love\" reached number one; \"Real Love\" also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit).

The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on ''Billboard's'' Country Albums chart, and also reached the Top{{nbs}}10 on ''Billboard''{{'s}} Top{{nbs}}200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top{{nbs}}10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\", which went to number one. ''Trio'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]]'' (1987), including the single \"[[The River Unbroken]]\", it ended up a commercial let-down, causing Parton to focus on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses]]\".

Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful. But her 1993 album ''[[Slow Dancing with the Moon]]'' won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart. She recorded \"The Day I Fall in Love\" as a duet with [[James Ingram]] for the feature film ''[[Beethoven's 2nd (film)|Beethoven's 2nd]]'' (1993). The songwriters (Ingram, [[Carole Bayer Sager]], and [[Clif Magness]]) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast.
