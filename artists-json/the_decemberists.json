The band consists of [[Colin Meloy]] ([[lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[guitar]], principal songwriter), [[Chris Funk]] (guitar, multi-instrumentalist), [[Jenny Conlee]] ([[piano]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[accordion]]), [[Nate Query]] ([[bass guitar|bass]]), and [[John Moen]] ([[drum kit|drums]]).\n\nTheir debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[5 Songs (The Decemberists EP)|5 Songs]]'', was self-released in 2001. Their eighth and latest full-length album ''[[I'll Be Your Girl]]'' was released on March 16, 2018, by [[Capitol Records]], and is the band's fifth record with the label.\n\nIn addition to their lyrics, which often focus on historical incidents and/or folklore, the Decemberists are also well known for their eclectic live shows. [[Audience participation]] is a part of each performance, typically during encores. The band stages whimsical reenactments of sea battles and other centuries-old events, typically of regional interest, or acts out songs with members of the crowd.\n\nIn 2011,  the track \"[[Down by the Water (The Decemberists song)|Down by the Water]]\" from the album ''[[The King Is Dead (album)|The King Is Dead]]'' was nominated for Best Rock Song at the [[54th Grammy Awards]].\n\n==History==\n\n===2000: Formation===\nThe Decemberists formed in 2000 when Colin Meloy left his band [[Tarkio (band)|Tarkio]] in Montana and moved to Portland, Oregon. There he met Nate Query, who introduced Meloy to Jenny Conlee (they had played together in the band Calobo) and the three scored a silent film together. Playing a solo show prior to meeting Query, Meloy met Chris Funk. Funk was a fan of Tarkio and played pedal steel on the first two Decemberists releases, not \"officially\" becoming a member until the third effort. The band's first drummer, Ezra Holbrook, was replaced by [[Rachel Blumberg]] after ''[[Castaways and Cutouts]]'', who in turn was replaced by [[John Moen]] after ''[[Picaresque (album)|Picaresque]]''. The band's name refers to the [[Decembrist revolt]], an 1825 insurrection in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. Meloy has stated that the name is also meant to invoke the \"drama and melancholy\" of the month of December.<ref>{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Gene|date=June 17, 2004|title=On Behalf of Orangina: The Decemberists perform their dramatic, literary alt-rock, with orangina soda in tow|work=[[Tucson Weekly]]|url=https://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/on-behalf-of-orangina/Content?oid=1076532|access-date=October 10, 2006}}</ref> [[5 Songs (The Decemberists EP)|''5 Songs'']], the band's debut [[extended play]], was self-released in 2001. The members at that time played for several hours in a McMenamins hotel the night before to raise the money needed to record in the studio the next day. This originally served as a demo tape and the five songs on it (minus \"Apology Song\") were recorded in under two hours.\n\n===2003\u20132005: Kill Rock Stars===\nAfter releasing its first full record, ''[[Castaways and Cutouts]]'', on [[Hush Records]], the group moved onto the [[Kill Rock Stars]] recording label. After the re-release of ''Castaways'', ''[[Her Majesty the Decemberists]]'' was released in 2003. In 2004, the band released \"[[The Tain (Decemberists album)|The Tain]]\", an eighteen-and-a-half minute single track based on the [[Irish mythology|Irish mythological]] epic {{lang|ga|[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]}}. The band's final album with Kill Rock Stars was ''[[Picaresque (album)|Picaresque]]'', which was recorded in a former church.\n\nIn March 2005, the band distributed a music video via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], the self-produced \"[[16 Military Wives]]\" (from ''[[Picaresque (album)|Picaresque]]'').<ref>{{cite news | title=Rockers Flex BitTorrent's Muscle | date=March 23, 2005 | publisher=Wired News | url=http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,66969,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109190719/http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,66969,00.html | archive-date=November 9, 2006 }}</ref> In the same month, the band's equipment trailer was stolen;<ref>{{cite news | title=Decemberists Shipwrecked By Pirates | date=March 22, 2005 | publisher=CMJ | url=http://www.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=3547565 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404101429/http://cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=3547565 | archive-date=April 4, 2005 }}</ref> fans contributed to a replacement fund, and another fundraiser was organized via an [[eBay]] auction, with buyers bidding for copies of ''[[Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey]]'' and original artwork by [[Carson Ellis]].

To cap off this period of activity, the band released the follow-up outtake EP ''[[Long Live the King (EP)|Long Live the King]]'' on November 1, 2011, as well as a live album from their tour for ''The King is Dead'' titled ''[[We All Raise Our Voices to the Air (Live Songs 04.11\u201308.11)]]'' on March 13, 2012. In addition, the band recorded a song for ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' soundtrack, called \"One Engine\". The soundtrack, ''[[The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond]]'', was released on March 20, 2012.\n\nWhile on hiatus, the group's only activity as The Decemberists was a cameo appearance on the 7th episode in the 24th season of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in which the band was rendered in the show's traditional style of animation and presented as the hip, new music teachers of Springfield Elementary. As well, the episode's theme music was performed with the signature folk flair of The Decemberists.\n\n===2014\u20132015: ''What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World'' ===\nDuring a solo tour in 2013, Meloy announced that The Decemberists would end their hiatus and begin working on a new album within the next year.
