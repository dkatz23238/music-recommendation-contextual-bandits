Dylan and Miller had been in several bands together in high school but went their separate ways upon graduation.  Dylan had moved to [[New York City]] to go to art school while Miller had started his own band called the 45's.  After the 45's broke up in 1989, Miller regained contact with Dylan and they began forming a new band called the Apples.  Barrie Maguire, who was in the 45's with Miller, joined the band as their bass player.  In 1990, [[Peter Yanowitz]] was added as the drummer.  The final member to join the group was keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]].  Jaffee was an active member of the [[Los Angeles]] music scene and had been playing with multiple bands in the area.  He met Dylan in 1990 in the Kibitz Room, a bar located in the back of [[Canter's]]; a Jewish deli located on [[Fairfax Avenue]] in Los Angeles.  He had heard the Apples were looking for an organ player and after meeting and talking with Dylan in the Kibitz Room, the two headed for Dylan's car to listen to the band's demo tape.  Jaffee was impressed by the songs and asked to join in on the band's next rehearsal.  After a long rehearsal session, Jaffee joined the band on the spot.<ref>{{cite serial |episode=Rami Jaffee |series=Dean Delray's Let There Be Talk|title=The Wallflowers |network=iTunes |date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Wallflowers Who's Who: Rami Jaffee |url=http://www.the-wallflowers.net/people.html |website=The Wallflowers Network |access-date=August 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716035500/http://www.the-wallflowers.net/people.html |archive-date=July 16, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===1991\u20131994: Debut album===\nThe Apples changed their name to the Wallflowers and began playing clubs around Los Angeles, specifically the [[Sunset Strip]], such as the [[Whisky a Go Go]], [[Gazzarri's]] and the [[Viper Room]]. While they were playing clubs the band was also sending their demo tape to record companies and figures within the music industry. One of those tapes caught the attention of Andrew Slater, who would eventually become the Wallflowers' manager.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Fricke |first1=David |title=The Confessions of Jakob Dylan: A Wallflower's Coming Out |url=http://www.the-wallflowers.net/article_rs1000.htm |via=The Wallflowers Network |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=June 5, 2014 |archive-date=October 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013150951/http://www.the-wallflowers.net/article_rs1000.htm }}</ref> Slater brought the Wallflowers to [[Virgin Records]], who signed the band to a record contract. The Wallflowers then set out to make their first album.  However, finding a producer who was willing to work with them proved to be difficult. The band was intent on recording live and few producers were willing to produce that way. Paul Fox eventually stepped in and agreed to produce the album. By the time the Wallflowers got into the studio in 1991, they had a small catalog of songs they had been performing live which they wanted to record for their debut album. All of the songs were written by Dylan with the rest of the band members contributing input on the music. When in the studio, the band were intent on using as little recording equipment as possible.  Dylan explained: \"If I could have had it my way I would not have seen a microphone or a cable anywhere.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wallflower |url=http://www.the-wallflowers.net/articles96_97.html |via=The Wallflowers Network |work=Details Magazine |access-date=June 5, 2014 |date=July 1997 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013145453/http://www.the-wallflowers.net/articles96_97.html |archive-date=October 13, 2006 }}</ref> When it came to recording, the songs were drawn out past the 3 to 4 minute norm; many songs were close to 5 minutes in length with two exceeding 7 minutes.

Around this time, the company was going through a shift in management which led to the removal of [[Jeff Ayeroff]] and Jordan Harris, the two people who initially brought the Wallflowers to Virgin. After Ayeroff and Harris left the company the Wallflowers began to feel that they had no future with Virgin and asked to be released from their contract.  The split with Virgin has been regarded as mutual.<ref>{{cite serial |title=The Truth About That First Record |episode=The Wallflowers |series=iTunes Originals |network=iTunes |date=2005}}</ref> By mid-1993 the Wallflowers were without a record label.\n\nAfter leaving Virgin, the Wallflowers went back to playing Los Angeles clubs in hopes of getting signed with another label. The band found it difficult to even get label representatives to come to their shows. In the year it took to get another record deal the Wallflowers gained and lost several band members. Bass player Barrie Maguire was asked to leave for undisclosed reasons in early 1993. The Wallflowers continued playing shows with replacement bass player Jimmie Snider until May 1993 when the band hired Greg Richling. Dylan and Richling went to high school together. The Wallflowers continued to play club shows in Los Angeles through early 1994 when drummer Peter Yanowitz left the band to join his girlfriend Natalie Merchant's band. Yanowitz brought in Barrie Maguire to help record Merchant's debut solo album, ''[[Tigerlily]]''. Around the time of Yanowitz's departure the Wallflowers caught the attention of [[Jimmy Iovine]] and Tom Whalley of [[Interscope Records]], who then signed the band to their label in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wallflowers Who's Who: Barrie Maguire |url=http://www.the-wallflowers.net/people.html |website=The Wallflowers Network |access-date=June 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716035500/http://www.the-wallflowers.net/people.html |archive-date=July 16, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Wallflowers Who's Who: Greg Richling |url=http://www.the-wallflowers.net/people.html |website=The Wallflowers Network |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716035500/http://www.the-wallflowers.net/people.html |archive-date=July 16, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===1995\u20131998: ''Bringing Down the Horse''===\nAfter signing with Interscope Records, the Wallflowers began preparations for their second album, ''[[Bringing Down the Horse]]''.

Jaffee has yet to say whether he has officially quit the Wallflowers but has continued to record and tour with the [[Foo Fighters]]. Jimmy Wallace has subbed in his spot ever since.  The Wallflowers continued to tour through the summer of 2013 and played their final show of the summer on August 17 at the River Roots Live Festival in [[Davenport, Iowa]], to a crowd of 17,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Scenes at River Roots Live 2013|url=http://roadtips.typepad.com/a_salesguys_guide_to_the_/2013/09/behind-the-scenes-at-river-roots-live-2013.html|website=Road Tips|access-date=October 20, 2014}}</ref> This show would turn out to be longtime bassist Greg Richling's and drummer Jack Irons' final show with the band. On September 8, Richling officially announced that he was leaving the Wallflowers after 20 years with the band. He left to pursue other interests. Irons announced he was leaving soon after, on September 15. Irons reportedly left to focus on his band project, Arthur Channel, who released their debut album on October 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yeatts|first1=Andrianna|title=Song Premiere: Arthur Channel|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2013/09/song-premiere-arthur-channel-16-children/|website=American Songwriter|access-date=October 20, 2014|date=September 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Wallflowers have continued to play shows since 2013 with a new drummer, bass player, guitar player, and keyboardist filling in for Irons, Richling, Mathis, and Jaffee.<ref name=\"Hamad 2016\">{{cite web | last=Hamad | first=Michael | title=Jakob Dylan's Wallflowers Still Connecting With Classics | website=courant.com | date=August 23, 2016 | url=https://www.courant.com/ctnow/music/hc-wallflowers-toyota-oakdale-theatre-wallingford-20160822-story.html | access-date=March 25, 2021}}</ref> Dylan stated later he would be continuing making music under name The Wallflowers as a solo project: \"The Wallflowers is me, and if I go under my own name, it's me.
