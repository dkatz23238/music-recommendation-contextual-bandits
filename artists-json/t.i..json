Harris began to gain major recognition in 2003 following his first high-profile feature on fellow Atlanta-based rapper [[Bone Crusher (rapper)|Bone Crusher]]'s single \"[[Never Scared (song)|Never Scared]]\". Harris earned more prominence with the release of ''[[Trap Muzik]]'' (2003), which included the [[Top 40]] songs \"[[Rubber Band Man]]\" and \"[[Let's Get Away]]\" (featuring [[Jazze Pha]]). The following year, Harris appeared on [[Destiny's Child]]'s international [[Hit single|hit]] \"[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]\" (alongside [[Lil Wayne]]), and capitalized on it with the release of his ''[[Urban Legend (album)|Urban Legend]]'' (2004) album. His subsequent albums, ''[[King (T.I. album)|King]]'' and ''[[T.I. vs. T.I.P.]]'', generated high record sales and were supported by popular singles, such as \"[[What You Know (T.I. song)|What You Know]]\" and \"[[Big Shit Poppin' (Do It)]]\", respectively.\n\nHarris' sixth album, ''[[Paper Trail]]'' (2008), became his most successful project, with the album being [[RIAA certification|certified gold]] for first-week sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States, additionally making it his third consecutive number one album. In 2013, Harris was featured on [[Robin Thicke]]'s single \"[[Blurred Lines]]\" (alongside [[Pharrell Williams]]), which peaked at number one on several major music charts. In November 2013, Harris announced that he had signed with [[Columbia Records]] after his 10-year contract with Atlantic came to an end. He released his Columbia debut ''[[Paperwork (T.I. album)|Paperwork]],'' in October 2014. In February 2016, Harris signed a distribution deal with [[Roc Nation]] and another deal with [[Epic Records]] in September 2018.

In the video, a man wearing a shirt which said \"Trap House\" was being beaten. T.I. mistook the logo to refer to \"Trap Muzik\". [[G-Unit]] artist [[Young Buck]] asked fellow [[Southern rap]]pers T.I. and Ludacris to appear on his new record on the track \"Stomp\". T.I. recorded a verse which contained a line that Young Buck considered to be an underhanded snub towards Ludacris: \"Me gettin' beat down? / That's ludicrous.\" Young Buck spoke to Ludacris about the verse, to maintain his neutrality in the controversy. Ludacris then recorded the verse that can be found on the album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489952/20040804/young_buck.jhtml|title=Young Buck To 'Stomp' Out Luda/ T.I.

The original version of the latter featured [[Kanye West]].\n\n=== Lil' Flip ===\nWhile T.I. was incarcerated in 2004, another popular southern rapper, [[Lil Flip]], took issue with him over his \"King of the South\" claims which launched a much publicized feud. In an October 26, 2004 interview with ''HipHopDX.com'', T.I. said he'd heard comments about Flip's \"lyrical ability\" for a long time but told [[music journalist]] [[Bayer Mack]] he didn't speak on it because he \"wasn't raised like that\".

Then it was said a fight broke out with one of the members of Lil Flip's entourage started swinging at T.I. until one of T.I.'s bodyguards started shooting. The same day T.I. went on a [[Houston]], Texas radio station talking about the altercation. He revealed that he had the tape and he was going to release it with an upcoming mixtape, but that did not happen because [[James Prince]] stopped him from distributing the tape. It is unknown whether T.I. still has the tape or not. The feud was squashed by Rap-a-Lot's Prince after having them sit down and resolve their feud. The feud was documented by the [[Houston Press]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/issues/2005-04-07/music/music2.html|title=Where's the Beef?

The music video for \"[[What Up, What's Haapnin]]\" was shot in Shawty Lo's [[housing project]] Bowen Homes, an apparent insult towards Shawty Lo.
