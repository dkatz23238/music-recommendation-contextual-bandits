She started her career as a singer in the [[acid jazz]] band Crisp in the mid-1990s in [[Adelaide]]. In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]], titled ''OnlySee'', in Australia. She moved to London and provided vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', in 2001, and her third, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004.\n\nSia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing and focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]), \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]).\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No. 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" and a trilogy of music videos co-directed by Sia and starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album, ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\". The same year, she began her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others, and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018, she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019. Sia has written many songs for films, and she directed a feature film, titled ''[[Music (2021 film)|Music]]'', which was released in early 2021 alongside an album, ''[[Music \u2013 Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture]]''.\n\nShe is an advocate for animal rights. Among the [[List of awards and nominations received by Sia|accolades]] received by Sia are nearly a dozen [[ARIA Awards]], 9 [[Grammy Award]] nominations and an [[MTV Video Music Award]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nSia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].
