The band consists of lead vocalist [[Sam Endicott]], guitarist [[Michael Zakarin]], keyboardist John Conway, bassist [[Mike Hindert]] and drummer Anthony Burulcich. They are best known for their 2005 top 10 UK single \"[[An Honest Mistake]]\" and their certified gold 2008 single \"Believe\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=The+Bravery#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum|website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]}}</ref> Before their initial split, they released three studio albums: ''[[The Bravery (album)|The Bravery]]'' (2005), ''[[The Sun and the Moon (The Bravery album)|The Sun and the Moon]]'' (2007) and ''[[Stir the Blood]]'' (2009). They also released a remixed edition of their second album, called ''[[The Sun and the Moon Complete]]'', in 2008, as well as an [[digital music|Internet live album]] called ''Live at the Wiltern Theater'' in 2010. The group's music is mostly [[post-punk]], [[dance music|dance]]-influenced rock.\n\nThe band was inactive from the early 2010s onward, with Endicott confirming the band's indefinite hiatus in April 2014. On July 31, 2021, The Bravery's website confirmed the return of the group.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and rising fame (2003)===\nFrontman-songwriter [[Sam Endicott]] and keyboardist John Conway were classmates at [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]. The two began a musical partnership, playing together in various bands in the Poughkeepsie area including a project with future ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' star [[Jonathan Togo]]. After graduating, Endicott and Conway moved to New York City, where Endicott switched from bass guitar to vocals and began writing music that would later become The Bravery.\n\nGuitarist Michael Zakarin joined after answering an advert in a local paper, and brought with him bassist Mike Hindert, a classmate of his from [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Drummer Anthony Burulcich was living in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] where he had studied percussion at [[Berklee College of Music]]. After his sister's death, Burulcich moved back to his childhood home in [[Long Island]] New York to be with his family. On the day Burulcich was moving, while driving with his belongings in a [[U-Haul]] truck, Endicott called him.\n\nThe band played their first gig at the Stinger Club in Brooklyn in November 2003. To promote their local shows, they manufactured 1,000 posters and 3 song cd samplers containing the songs \"An Honest Mistake\", \"No Brakes\" and \"Public Service Announcement\". Both items featured the iconic \u201cPhoenix\u201d image by New York artist [http://cfinley.com [[C. Finley]]]. The same artwork later became the cover of The Bravery's debut album. The band self promoted themselves by handing out CDs and postering the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]]. The band also promoted themselves on the internet and were one of the first bands on [[MySpace]] to have a profile. Their MySpace profile pointed to thebravery.com, where the same 3 songs were available as downloadable [[MP3]]s.<ref>[http://www.thedelimagazine.com/bravery/index.htm The Deli \u2013 Interview with The Bravery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209091156/http://www.thedelimagazine.com/bravery/index.htm |date=December 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===''Unconditional EP'' (2004)===\nAfter a few months of headlining and selling out small clubs, The Bravery booked a residency at the Lower East side club [[Arlene's Grocery]].
