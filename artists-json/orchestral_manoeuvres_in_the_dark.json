See [[WP:ENGVAR]].--> an English [[electronic music|electronic]] band formed in [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], [[Merseyside]], in 1978. The group consists of co-founders [[Andy McCluskey]] (vocals, bass guitar) and [[Paul Humphreys]] (keyboards, vocals), along with [[Martin Cooper (musician)|Martin Cooper]] (keyboards, saxophone) and [[Stuart Kershaw]] (drums); McCluskey has been the only constant member. Regarded as pioneers of electronic music, OMD combined an [[Experimental music|experimental]], [[Minimal music|minimalist]] ethos with pop sensibilities, becoming key figures in the late-1970s/early-1980s emergence of [[synth-pop]]. The band were also one of the original acts involved in the [[MTV]]-driven [[Second British Invasion]] of the US.\n\nMcCluskey and Humphreys led precursor group [[The Id (band)|the Id]] from 1977\u20131978, and re-recorded their track \"[[Electricity (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Electricity]]\" as OMD's debut single in 1979. Weathering an \"uncool\" image and a degree of hostility from music critics, the band achieved popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 [[List of anti-war songs|anti-war song]] \"[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]\", and gained further recognition via ''[[Architecture & Morality]]'' (1981) and its three hit singles. Although later reappraised, ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'' (1983) was seen as overly experimental, and eroded European support. The group embraced a more radio-friendly sound on ''[[Junk Culture]]'' (1984); this change in direction led to greater success in the United States, and spawned hits including \"[[If You Leave (song)|If You Leave]]\" (from the 1986 film ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'').\n\nIn 1989, creative differences saw Humphreys and other members form the spin-off band [[the Listening Pool]], leaving McCluskey the only remaining member of OMD. The group returned with a new line-up and explored the [[dance-pop]] genre: ''[[Sugar Tax (album)|Sugar Tax]]'' (1991) and its initial singles were hits in Europe. OMD then began to flounder amid the guitar-oriented [[grunge]] and [[Britpop]] movements, eventually disbanding in 1996. McCluskey later conceived [[girl group]] [[Atomic Kitten]], for whom he served as a principal songwriter, while Humphreys formed the duo [[Onetwo (band)|Onetwo]] alongside [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]] vocalist [[Claudia Br\u00fccken]].\n\nIn 2006, OMD reformed with Humphreys and McCluskey revisiting the experimental territory of their early work; the band have achieved 13 top-20 entries on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Their 20th century output yielded 18 top-40 appearances on the [[UK Singles Chart]], as well as four top-40 entries on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although sometimes identified as a [[Cult following|cult band]], OMD have sold over 40 million records worldwide, and have influenced many artists across diverse genres and disciplines.\n\n==History==\n===1975\u20131979: Roots and early years===\n[[File:Andy_McCluskey.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Singer and co-founder Andy McCluskey]]\nFounders [[Andy McCluskey]] and [[Paul Humphreys]] met at primary school in [[Meols]] in the early 1960s, and in the mid-1970s, as teenagers, they were involved in different local groups but shared a distaste for [[Cock rock|guitar-driven rock with a macho attitude]] popular among their friends at the time.<ref>Taylor, Paul.

McCluskey's first album from the new OMD was the [[dance-pop]] ''[[Sugar Tax (album)|Sugar Tax]]'' album in May 1991, which charted at No.&nbsp;3 in the UK. McCluskey recruited in 1989 Liverpool musicians Raw Unlimited (Lloyd Massett, [[Stuart Kershaw]], Nathalie Loates) as collaborators for the making of ''Sugar Tax'': writing credits carefully distinguished between songs written by OMD (i.e., McCluskey) and songs written by OMD/Kershaw/Massett.<ref>''Sugar Tax'' liner notes. 1991.

McCluskey's live band was then formed by [[Nigel Ipinson]] (keyboards), Phil Coxon (keyboards), and Abe Juckes (drums) from late 1990.

The lead single \"[[Stand Above Me]]\" peaked at no. 21 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], with a follow-up single, \"[[Dream of Me (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Dream of Me]]\", charting at no. 24. Paul Humphreys, while no longer part of the group, co-wrote the single \"[[Everyday (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Everyday]]\" (a No. 59 UK chart entry). The fifth track from ''Liberator'', \"[[Dream of Me (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Dream of Me]]\", was built around a sample from \"[[Love's Theme]]\" by [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]], a track which was written and produced by [[Barry White]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.omd.uk.com/discography/liberator/ |title=Liberator |website=Omd.uk.com |access-date=18 May 2017 }}</ref> To release the \"Dream of Me\" track as an OMD single, however, McCluskey had to agree that the single release of the track would remove the actual \"Love's Theme\" sample, but still be officially titled \"Dream of Me (Based on Love's Theme)\", and furthermore would still give a writing credit to White.<ref>''Liberator'' liner notes. 1993.

The record spawned OMD's first Top 20 hit in five years, \"[[Walking on the Milky Way (song)|Walking on the Milky Way]]\".\n\nThough both ''Liberator'' and ''Universal'' produced minor hits, McCluskey retired OMD in late 1996, having faced waning public interest amid the [[grunge]] and [[Britpop]] movements.<ref name=\"Majewski2014\"/><ref name=\"C\u00e1rdenas\"/> A particular source of frustration was the modest commercial response to \"[[Walking on the Milky Way (song)|Walking on the Milky Way]]\", over which McCluskey said he \"sweated blood\", considering it \"about as good a song as I could write\". However, the track was not [[playlist]]ed by [[BBC Radio 1]], and [[Woolworths Group (United Kingdom)|Woolworths]] did not stock it.
