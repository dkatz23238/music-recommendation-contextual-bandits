From their fourth single, \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\" (1986), Erasure established themselves on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming one of the most successful acts of the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. From 1986 to 2007, the pair achieved 24 consecutive top-40 entries in the UK singles chart. By 2009, 34 of their 37 chart-eligible singles and EPs had made the UK top 40, including 17 climbing into the top 10.

With their second release ''[[The Circus (Erasure album)|The\u00a0Circus]]''\u00a0the following year in 1987 came major success, the album skyrocketing to a UK number 6 and spawning four top-20 singles. \n\nTheir third album, ''[[The Innocents (Erasure album)|The\u00a0Innocents]]''\u00a0released in 1988, was rendered a number one and was followed the same year by the Christmas EP ''[[Crackers\u00a0International]]''\u00a0peaking at number 2. ''The Innocents'' set the scene as being the first in a string of albums to place in the top spot, with their next five long-form releases also reaching the pole position of the [[UK Albums Chart]]: the albums ''[[Wild! (Erasure album)|Wild!]]''\u00a0(1989) and the Mercury Prize nominated ''[[Chorus (Erasure album)|Chorus]]''\u00a0(1991), the [[ABBA]] tribute EP ''[[Abba-esque]]''\u00a0(1992), the compilation ''[[Pop!\u00a0The\u00a0First\u00a020\u00a0Hits]]''\u00a0(1992), then the album ''[[I\u00a0Say\u00a0I Say\u00a0I\u00a0Say]]''\u00a0(1994). \n\nErasure's best-known songs are mainly from albums of this period and include \"[[Oh L'amour]]\", \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\", \"[[Victim of Love (Erasure song)|Victim of Love]]\", \"[[The Circus (song)|The Circus]]\", \"[[Ship of Fools (Erasure song)|Ship of Fools]]\", \"[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]\", \"[[A Little Respect]]\", \"[[Crackers International|Stop!]]\", \"[[Drama!]]\", \"[[Blue Savannah]]\", \"[[Star (Erasure song)|Star]]\", \"[[Chorus (Erasure song)|Chorus]]\", \"[[Love to Hate You]]\", \"[[Breath of Life (Erasure song)|Breath of Life]]\", \"[[Always (Erasure song)|Always]]\" and \"[[Run to the Sun]]\".\n\nErasure's commercial success began to fade from 1995, with the atmospheric self-titled album ''[[Erasure (album)|Erasure]]''\u00a0which, despite being a critical success, confused its audience. The mixed reception of the following album, ''[[Cowboy (album)|Cowboy]]''\u00a0(1997), confirmed a decline in Erasure's popularity until the album ''[[Loveboat (album)|Loveboat]]''\u00a0(2000), which went almost unnoticed. \n\nIn the mid-2000s, however, the duo have managed to make a commercial comeback in some European countries and in the United States, notably thanks to their cover album ''[[Other\u00a0People's\u00a0Songs]]''\u00a0(2003), followed by the album ''[[Nightbird (Erasure album)|Nightbird]]''\u00a0(2005), which won back fans. This return to favour gave the band their last two commercially successful singles: \"[[Solsbury\u00a0Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\"\u00a0(2003) (a [[Peter Gabriel]] cover) and \"[[Breathe (Erasure song)|Breathe]]\" (2005). In the late 2000s, Erasure began briefly a new commercial decline with the acoustic album ''[[Union Street (album)|Union\u00a0Street]]''\u00a0(2006) followed by ''[[Light\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0End\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0World]]''\u00a0(2007) and ''[[Tomorrow's\u00a0World (album)|Tomorrow's\u00a0World]]''\u00a0(2011), and the Christmas album ''[[Snow Globe (album)|Snow\u00a0Globe]]''\u00a0(2013).\n\nErasure have maintained their return to the top 20 album charts with ''[[The\u00a0Violet\u00a0Flame]]''\u00a0(2014), ''[[World\u00a0Be\u00a0Gone]]''\u00a0(2017) and ''[[The Neon\u00a0(Erasure album)|The\u00a0Neon]]''\u00a0(2020). Despite the singles from this decade not managing to reach the charts, however, a solid international fanbase enables Erasure to maintain its activity through touring and online sales, as well as the royalties attached to the catalogue of their past successful records.\n\nAchieving mainstream success at home in the UK, Erasure also has a strong following abroad, especially in some European countries\u2014mainly in\u00a0Ireland, Germany, Austria, Denmark and Sweden. Surprisingly, Erasure has a broad audience in some South American countries, especially in Argentina, Chile and Peru. In the US, Erasure had three successful singles: \"[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]\" (1988) at number 12, their biggest chart placing ever in that country, \"[[A Little Respect]]\" (1988) at number 14, and \"[[Always (Erasure song)|Always]]\" (1994) at number 20. In Russia, as well as in the former [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc countries]], Erasure is mostly known for the sole song \"[[Love to Hate You]]\" (1991). In France, \"[[Oh L'amour]]\" (1986) was the band's only successful single, peaking at number 14 in the singles top 50 of that country, followed by \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\" (1986) that underperformed at a low number 39 (in February 1987) and still remains to this day Erasure's last entry in the French singles chart.\n\nOverall in their career, Erasure have penned over 200 songs and have sold over 28 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|date=25 August 2014|title=ERASURE New Single \"Elevation\" Remixed by BT|url=http://www.emusician.com/artists/1333/erasure-new-single-elevation-remixed-by-bt/48484|access-date=10 September 2017|website=Remixmag.com}}</ref><ref name=\"simpson\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nAs a teenager, [[Vince Clarke]] was inspired to make [[electronic music]] after hearing [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] synth band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/erasure-vince-clarke-2020-interview-2648175250.html|title=Synthpop King Vince Clarke on Erasure's 18th Studio Album, 'The Neon'|last=Shand|first=Max|date=12 October 2020|website=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=3 March 2021|quote=[OMD] were such a huge influence on me.

Their debut album, ''[[Wonderland (Erasure album)|Wonderland]]'', was mostly recorded in 1985 and released in June 1986. Although it only made the UK top 75, it made a sizeable mark in Germany, making the top 20.\n\nIt was the release of album ''[[The Circus (Erasure album)|the Circus]] that their fourth single, \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\", finally received gained recognition in the UK in late 1986. The song peaked at number 2 in the UK and Germany and spent many weeks in the UK top 40, marking the beginning of a long string of major hits for the duo.\n\nThe single's parent album, ''[[The Circus (Erasure album)|The Circus]]'', was released in March 1987 and reached number 6 and turned platinum in the UK with three additional hit singles: \"[[It Doesn't Have To Be]]\", \"[[Victim of Love (Erasure song)|Victim of Love]]\" and \"[[The Circus (song)|The Circus]]\". The album remained on the charts for over a year.\n\nErasure's third album, ''[[The Innocents (Erasure album)|The Innocents]]'', was released in April 1988. Preceded by the top 10 single \"[[Ship of Fools (Erasure song)|Ship of Fools]]\", the album hit number one in the UK on its initial release and returned to the summit a year later, eventually going double platinum. It also turned platinum in the U.S., generating two top 20 hits in \"[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]\" and \"[[A Little Respect]]\". ''The Innocents'' was the first of five consecutive number one albums for Erasure in the UK, including the greatest hits compilation ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]''. In November 1988, the ''[[Crackers International]]'' EP, hit number 2 in the UK. The albums ''[[Wild! (Erasure album)|Wild!]]'' (1989) and ''[[Chorus (Erasure album)|Chorus]]'' (1991) both contained four top 20 singles and were major sellers.\n\n''[[Crackers International]]'' was bettered in 1992 by another EP, ''[[Abba-esque]]'', (covering 4 [[ABBA]] hits), which became Erasure's first (and to-date only) number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=MTV>{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Erasure Bio|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/erasure/biography/|website=MTV Artists|access-date=25 January 2016}}</ref> It featured a video of the duo dressed in ABBA outfits, and was one of the principal drivers of the ABBA revival scene in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Image:19920908 erasure andybell magdeburg.jpg|200px|thumb|Andy Bell in 1992]]\nAlso in 1990, Erasure contributed the song \"[[Too Darn Hot]]\" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. In 1992, a singles compilation, ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]'', also hit number one and went triple platinum, featuring all the band's singles released from 1985 to 1992.\n\nIn 1994, Erasure released ''[[I Say I Say I Say]]'', their fifth consecutive number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Its first single, \"[[Always (Erasure song)|Always]]\", became the band's third top 20 hit in the United States. A second single, \"[[Run to the Sun]]\", was released in July and became their final UK top 10 hit until 2003. \"[[I Love Saturday]]\" was released in November and was the third and final single from the album.\n\n===Releases 1995\u20132007===\nThe October 1995 release of the album ''[[Erasure (album)|Erasure]]'' marked a determined shift away from Erasure's signature three-minute synthpop to a more introspective and experimental sound. Nevertheless, it made the UK top 15 and spawned two UK top 20 singles, \"[[Stay with Me (Erasure song)|Stay with Me]]\" and \"[[Fingers & Thumbs (Cold Summer's Day)|Fingers & Thumbs]]\". A remixed version of \"[[Rock Me Gently (Erasure song)|Rock Me Gently]]\" was released only in Germany and the Czech Republic as the third single.\n\nIn spite of a return to three-minute pop songs, the 1997 album ''[[Cowboy (album)|Cowboy]]'' did not restore the success of their 1986\u20131994 era. ''Cowboy'' enjoyed a short-lived success, peaking at number 10 in the UK but lasting only two weeks in the UK top 40. In the U.S. ''Billboard'' charts though, it was one of their most successful records. The first single \"[[In My Arms (Erasure song)|In My Arms]]\" reached number 13 in the UK and entered the top 2 on the U.S. Dance chart.  The second single \"[[Don't Say Your Love Is Killing Me]]\" made number 23 in the UK. The third single \"[[Rain (Erasure song)|Rain]]\" was also only released in Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn October 2000, Erasure released their ninth studio album ''[[Loveboat (album)|Loveboat]]'', co-produced with [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], though only peaking at a lowly number 45. The first single was \"[[Freedom (Erasure song)|Freedom]]\", which made a brief entry into the UK top 30. In 2001, they released a limited EP, ''[[Moon & the Sky]]'' containing new versions of the title song, a cover of the song \"[[Baby Love]]\" and some acoustic versions of ''Loveboat'' songs.\n\nThe 2003 release ''[[Other People's Songs]]'' was a collection of [[cover version]]s. Its first single, a cover of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s song \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\", reached the UK top 10, and Erasure were invited to perform on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for the first time since March 1997.  The second single from the album was a cover of [[Steve Harley]]'s \"[[Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)]]\", which made number 14 in the UK. \nIn 2003, a new 'best of' compilation was released, called ''[[Hits! The Very Best of Erasure]]''. Included was a new version of the 1986 song \"Oh L'amour\" \u2014 originally a commercial flop in the UK, this new version charted in the top 15.\n\nErasure's 2005 album ''[[Nightbird (Erasure album)|Nightbird]]'''s first single, \"[[Breathe (Erasure song)|Breathe]]\", reached number 4 in the UK charts (their first top 5 hit in more than a decade) and achieved the number one position on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|U.S. Dance chart]], 18 years after their first chart-topper.\n\nThe next single, \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Erasure song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which made the UK top 15, enabled purchasers to configure their own remixes of the single through the band's website, with each variant of the song limited to a single download.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sean.co.uk/a/musicjournalism/var/erasure_download_mp3_customisation.shtm|title=Erasure pioneers customised MP3 sales|publisher=Sean.co.uk|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref> The third single was a double A-side, featuring new versions of \"[[Here I Go Impossible Again]]\"/\"[[All This Time Still Falling Out of Love]]\".\n\n''[[Union Street (album)|Union Street]]'' was a 2006 side-project which featured a collection of previously released album tracks that the band re-interpreted in an [[Acoustic music|acoustic]]/[[country & western]] style.
