When he was a child, his family took regular trips to the country, where his grandfather ran a farm. He attended Seven Oaks Elementary School and [[Chapin High School]]. While home from college, he was a waiter at California Dreaming restaurant in Columbia. Beam earned a bachelor's degree in art from [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. He specialized in painting before graduating from the [[Florida State University Film School]] with an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degree. Before the release of the first Iron & Wine album, Beam's main source of income was as a professor of film and cinematography at the [[University of Miami]] and [[Miami International University of Art & Design]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2008-04-10/music/iron-and-wine/a | title= ''Iron and Wine'', Jason Ferguson, Miami New Times, April 10, 2008}}</ref> He had been writing songs for over seven years before a friend lent him a four-track recorder. He began making demos and gave one to his friend Michael Bridwell, brother of [[Band of Horses]] lead singer, [[Ben Bridwell]]. Michael handed it to Mike McGonigal, editor of [[Yeti (magazine)|Yeti magazine]], who chose \"Dead Man's Will\", later released on ''[[In the Reins]]'', for inclusion on one of his magazine's compilation CDs. Beam later came to the attention of [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]] co-owner, [[Jonathan Poneman]], who contacted Beam to propose a deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.splendidezine.com/features/iron/|title=\"Iron and Wine\", Georgiana Cohen|website=Ssplendidezine.com|access-date=August 25, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011025939/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/iron/|archive-date=October 11, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"AmericanStatesman\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehighhat.com/Pop&Clicks/002/iron_and_wine.html | title=\"Planting Together: An interview with Iron and Wine's Sam Beam\", Maud Newton|website=Thehighhat.com|access-date=August 25, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/iron+wine | title=\"Iron & Wine: Biography\", James Christopher Monger, Rovi|website=Pandora.com|access-date=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\nBeam released his first Iron & Wine album, ''[[The Creek Drank the Cradle]]'', on the Sub Pop label in 2002. Beam wrote, performed, recorded and produced the album in his home studio. Featuring acoustic guitars, [[banjo]], and [[slide guitar]], the album's music has been compared to that of [[Nick Drake]],<ref>{{cite web | last=Kearney | first=Ryan | title=Iron & Wine: The Creek Drank the Cradle |work=Pitchfork | date=October 2, 2002 | url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4126-the-creek-drank-the-cradle/ | access-date=October 11, 2010 }}</ref> [[Simon and Garfunkel]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Bickford |first=B.R. |title=Iron & Wine: \"The Creek Drank the Cradle\" |work=Salon.com |date=February 19, 2003 |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/audio/music/2003/02/19/iron_wine/index.html |access-date=May 14, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716134647/http://dir.salon.com/story/audio/music/2003/02/19/iron_wine/index.html |archive-date=July 16, 2006 }}</ref> [[Elliott Smith]], [[Neil Young]] and [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]].\n\nAlso in 2002, Beam recorded a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[The Postal Service]]'s then-unreleased song \"[[Such Great Heights]]\". Rather than being included on an Iron & Wine release, the track was initially included as a [[A-side and B-side|b-side]] of the original version by The Postal Service. It was later included on the B-sides and rarities album, ''[[Around the Well]]''. He then followed up on his debut album in 2003 with ''[[The Sea & The Rhythm]]'', an EP containing other home-recorded tracks with a similar style to the songs on the debut.\n\nBeam's second full-length album, ''[[Our Endless Numbered Days]]'' (2004), was recorded in a professional studio with a significant increase in fidelity. Produced in Chicago by [[Brian Deck]], the focus was still on acoustic material, but the inclusion of other band members gave rise to a slightly different sound. That same year, he recorded the song \"The Trapeze Swinger\" for the film ''[[In Good Company (2004 film)|In Good Company]]'', and had his version of \"Such Great Heights\" featured in an advertisement for [[M&M's]] and in the film and soundtrack for ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]''. This version was later used in a 2006 [[Ask.com]] advertisement, and eventually released as a single in 2006 backed with recordings of \"The Trapeze Swinger\" and \"Naked as We Came\" made for Radio Vienna.\n\n[[File:Sarahbeam.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Sarah Beam, Samuel's sister, at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland]]\nIn February 2005, he released an EP entitled ''[[Woman King]]'', which expanded on the sounds of his previous LP with the addition of electric guitars. Each track features a spiritual female figure, and had subtle [[Bible|Biblical]] undertones.\n\nThe EP ''[[In the Reins]]'', a collaboration with the Arizona-based rock band [[Calexico (band)|Calexico]], was released in September 2005. Beam wrote all of the EP's songs years earlier, but Calexico added their trademark fusion of [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] rock, traditional Mexican music and [[jazz]] to the songs' arrangements. Several tracks, most notably, \"Burn That Broken Bed\", feature brass instruments, a first for Beam's music.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|others=Iron & Wine |date=2011 |title=\"Burn That Broken Bed\" }}</ref>\n\nThe third full-length Iron & Wine album, entitled ''[[The Shepherd's Dog]]'', was released September 25, 2007.<ref>Khanna, Vish.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011175602/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=115&csid2=4&fid1=27544 \"Iron and Wine\u2019s Guiding Light\"], ''[[Exclaim!]]'', October 2007.</ref> This album was voted one of the ten best of 2007 by ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine.<ref>''Paste'' magazine issue No. 38</ref> Contributors included Joey Burns and Paul Niehaus of [[Calexico (band)|Calexico]], as well as jazz musicians Matt Lux and [[Bob Burger]].<ref name=\"exclaimmag\">{{cite web|author=Khanna, Vish |title=Iron and Wine's Guiding Light |work=Exclaim.ca |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=115&csid2=4&fid1=27544 |date=October 2007 |access-date=September 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011175602/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=115&csid2=4&fid1=27544 |archive-date=October 11, 2007 }}</ref> When asked to describe the album to ''The Independent'', Beam remarked that \"it's not a political propaganda record, but it's definitely inspired by political confusion, because I was really taken aback when [[George W.

The ''Iron & Wine iTunes Exclusive EP'' features unreleased studio recordings, including a [[Stereolab]] cover and two tracks which had previously only appeared on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]]. The ''Live Session (iTunes Exclusive)'' features Beam and his sister, Sarah Beam, performing a number of tracks from his albums, as well as a cover of [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s \"[[Love Vigilantes]]\". Sarah Beam has contributed backing vocals on many of Beam's studio recordings.\n\nBeam's music has appeared in television series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[The L Word]]'' and ''[[House (TV series)|House M.D.]]'' \"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\" was used in the film ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]''. The song was specifically chosen for the film's prom scene by [[Kristen Stewart]], the female lead, and appears on the [[Twilight (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack]].\n\nThe B-sides and rarities album ''[[Around the Well]]'' was released in 2009. Iron & Wine also contributed the song \"Stolen Houses (Die)\" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nOn November 26, 2010 Iron & Wine released a special edition ''Record Store Day Black Friday'' 12\" vinyl and CD single called, ''Walking Far From Home'' for independent record stores.\n\n''[[Kiss Each Other Clean]]'', Iron & Wine's fourth full-length album, was released on January 25, 2011 on [[Warner Bros.
