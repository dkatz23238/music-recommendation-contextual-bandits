Corner's striking and wide-ranging voice, and his way of programming sounds and beats, make up the obvious characteristic of the IAMX sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darktwincities.com/reviews.php?review=187 |title=DarkTwinCities: ''IAMX - Kingdom of Welcome Addiction'' review by Christopher Roddy |publisher=darktwincities.com |date=2008-04-10 |access-date=2012-05-13}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2006 until 2014 IAMX was based in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], where Corner found \"the spirit to care less about the music industry and take an independent route.\"<ref name=\"Cat\" /> Berlin is also mentioned in IAMX's lyrics that concern subjects such as sexual identity, death, love, narcotic intoxication, decadence, critique of religion and politics, alienation, addiction, modern society, and gender bending. The topic of gender bending is further emphasised by Corner's own distinctive and androgynous image.<ref name=\"Front\">{{cite web |url=http://i-conoclastic.co.uk/frontandcentre/?tag=iamx |title=Front & Centre: ''IAMX @ Heaven London 13/10/2011'' |publisher=i-conoclastic.co.uk |date=2011-10-13 |access-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121040135/http://i-conoclastic.co.uk/frontandcentre/?tag=iamx |archive-date=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAs of 2014 to 2016, IAMX have relocated to Los Angeles from Berlin, citing a much-needed change to a better climate and a break with old ties in Berlin.\n\nIAMX are known for their highly energetic and theatrical live performances.

The name 'I am X' refers to ''[[Becoming X]]'', the title of the Sneaker Pimps' debut album.

''Kiss + Swallow'' was recorded in Corner's home studio in London called The Den.<ref name=\"k+sbooklet\">{{cite book| last=Corner|first=Chris|author-link=Chris Corner|title=Kiss + Swallow|series=Album booklet |publisher=BMG|location=London|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nMany of the songs were initially written by Corner for a fourth [[Sneaker Pimps]] album, but while the band was working on the album it soon became clear that the songs did not suit the new direction of Sneaker Pimps. The songs remained important to Corner, so he decided to keep working on them and to eventually use them for a separate project.<ref name=\"TW1\" />\n\nAfter the release of ''Kiss + Swallow'', Corner went on tour with IAMX, playing venues throughout Europe and the US. The live line-up varied between a revolving cast of close friends including Sue Denim of [[Robots in Disguise]] (whose vocals are also featured on the album),<ref name=\"k+sbooklet\" /> [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Julian Barratt]] of [[The Mighty Boosh]], James Cook of Nemo, Mary Ambrose,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electrified.info/html/body_i_am_x___client_tour.html |title=Electrified: ''IAMX + Client Tour'' |publisher=electrified.info|date=2004-09-27 |access-date=2012-05-20}}</ref> and actress [[Julia Davis]] of ''[[Nighty Night]]''.\n\n''Kiss + Swallow'' was released in the US on 17 June 2008. The US album included the previously unreleased track \"Polaroids\" and a remix of the title song by [[Moonbootica]]. It also carries a different cover.\n\nBetween tours in 2005, Corner wrote and produced the soundtrack for the French movie ''[[Sky Fighters|Les Chevaliers du Ciel]]'' (English title: ''Sky Fighters'') and the second Robots in Disguise album, ''[[Get RID!]]''.\n\n=== ''The Alternative'' and ''Live in Warsaw'' (2006\u20132008) ===\n\nIAMX's second album, ''[[The Alternative (album)|The Alternative]]'', was released in April 2006 in Europe, October 2007 (digitally) and November 2007 (physically) in the UK and Ireland, and May 2008 on Metropolis Records in the US. UK and US versions feature a slightly different cover with black tape rather than yellow tape. In addition to variant cover artwork, UK and US versions also feature alternate versions of several tracks with added production and added backing vocals from [[Janine Gezang]] as well as a hidden instrumental string version of \"Spit It Out\", arranged and recorded by Audrey Morse.<ref>{{cite book| last=Corner|first=Chris|author-link=Chris Corner|title=The Alternative|series=Album booklet |publisher=BMG Music Publishing UK| location=Berlin|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nIn summer 2006, a new live line-up was announced as follows: Janine Gezang on keyboards/synths, backing vocals and bass; Dean Rosenzweig on guitars and bass; and Tom Marsh on drums.

Of the songs on ''Everything Is Burning'', Chris says, \"They were half written for ''Metanoia'', there was a surplus of material that didn\u2019t make it to the album. It happens with every album that I do, where there are about 5-7 songs that don\u2019t make it. However, these tracks I felt so connected to that I didn\u2019t want to drag them into another era, they had too much of a connection to ''Metanoia'' that they had to remain connected and put the album to rest for me. This EP was in many ways me celebrating my strength and victory over that time period.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crypticrock.com/interview-chris-corner-of-iamx/|title=Interview - Chris Corner of IAMX - Cryptic Rock|website=crypticrock.com|date=13 October 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Unfall'' (2017) ===\n\nOn 22 September 2017, ''Unfall'' (the German word for 'accident') was released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spillmagazine.com/spill-album-review-iamx-unfall/ |title=Spill Album Review: IAMX - Unfall |website=Spill Magazine |date=22 September 2017 |access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref> Chris Corner expanded his sonic palette through remixes for others and his own experimental work. Chris now turned his Unfall alias into the title for an instrumental and abstract album that showcased him working with modular synthesizers and avoiding pop radio formats. During the recording process, Chris connected with famed UK producer and friend [[Jim Abbiss]] (Adele/Ladytron/Kasabian/Arctic Monkeys), whom he worked with on Sneaker Pimps debut ''Becoming X''. Both discussed how they were spending their current time exploring and experimenting and agreed that it would be fun to have Jim hang out in Chris\u2019 LA studio for a week and play around.  That turned into a fruitful seven days, as Jim ended up co-writing and co-producing several album tracks: \"Running Point\", \"Trust The Machine\", \"Cat's Cradle\", \"Polar I.\", \"TeddyLion\", \"11.11\", and \"The Disease To Please\". The last features vocals from [[The Go Go's]] rhythm guitarist and vocalist [[Jane Wiedlin]].  Chris and Jane had been looking for something to work together on, and this just came about naturally, according to Chris.\n\nThe single \"Little Deaths\" was released from the album on 15 September 2017.\n\n=== ''Alive in New Light'' (2017\u20132018) ===\nIAMX's eighth album, ''[[Alive In New Light]]'', was released on 2 February 2018.
