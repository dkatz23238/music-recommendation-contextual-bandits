In early 1970 Ferry had auditioned as lead singer for [[King Crimson]], who were seeking a replacement for [[Greg Lake]]. While [[Robert Fripp]] and [[Pete Sinfield]] decided Ferry's voice was unsuitable for King Crimson's material, they were impressed with his talent and helped the fledgling Roxy Music to obtain a contract with [[E.G. Records]].\n\n[[Andy Mackay]] replied to Ferry's advertisement, not as a keyboard-player but a saxophonist and oboist, though he did have a [[VCS3]] synthesizer. Mackay had already met [[Brian Eno]] during university days, as both were interested in avant-garde and electronic music. Although Eno was a non-musician, he could operate a synthesizer and owned a [[Revox]] reel-to-reel tape machine, so Mackay convinced him to join the band as a technical adviser. Before long Eno was an official member of the group.  Rounding out the original sextet were guitarist Roger Bunn (who had issued the well-regarded solo album ''Piece Of Mind'' earlier in 1970)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/roger-bunn-mn0001614978/biography|title=Roger Bunn - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> and drummer Dexter Lloyd, a classically trained [[timpani]]st.

Although he did not initially make the band as a guitarist, the group were impressed enough with Manzanera that he was invited to become Roxy Music's roadie, an offer which he accepted.\n\nThe band's fortunes were greatly increased by the support of broadcaster [[John Peel]] and ''Melody Maker'' journalist [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]]. Williams became an enthusiastic fan after meeting Ferry and being given a demonstration tape during mid-1971, and wrote the first major article on the band, featured on ''Melody Maker'''s \"Horizons\" page in the edition of 7 August 1971. This line-up of Roxy Music (Ferry/Mackay/Eno/Simpson/Thompson/O'List) recorded a BBC session shortly thereafter.\n\n===First two albums (1972\u20131973)===\nIn early February 1972, guitarist O'List quit the group abruptly after an altercation with Paul Thompson, which took place at their audition for David Enthoven of [[E.G. Records|EG Management]]. When O'List didn't show up for the next rehearsal, Manzanera was asked to come along, on the pretext of becoming the band's sound mixer. When he arrived he was invited to play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, Manzanera had learned their entire repertoire and as a result, he was immediately hired as O'List's permanent replacement, joining on 14 February 1972. Manzanera, the son of an English father and a Colombian mother, had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child, and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry, Mackay and Eno, he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band, with an interest in a wide variety of music. Manzanera also knew other well-known musicians, such as [[David Gilmour]], who was a friend of his older brother, and [[Soft Machine]]'s [[Robert Wyatt]].\n\nTwo weeks after Manzanera joined the band, Roxy Music signed with EG Management.<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) pp.376\u201377</ref>\n[[File:Roxy Music - TopPop 1973 13.png|thumb|right|Roxy Music perform on ''[[TopPop]]'' in 1973.

A&R staffer Tim Clark records that although he argued strongly that Island should contract them, company boss [[Chris Blackwell]] at first seemed unimpressed and Clark assumed he was not interested. A few days later however, Clark and Enthoven were standing in the hallway of the Island offices examining cover images for the album when Blackwell walked past, glanced at the artwork and said \"Looks great!

He was replaced by Rik Kenton.<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) p.376</ref>\n\nTo bring more attention to their album, Roxy Music decided to record and release a single. Their debut single was \"[[Virginia Plain]]\", which scored No.&nbsp;4 in the British charts. The band's eclectic visual image, captured in their debut performance on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', became a cornerstone for the glam trend in the UK. The single caused a renewed interest in the album. Soon after \"Virginia Plain\", Rik Kenton departed the band, which would never again have a permanent bass player.<!--Do not add note stating that Kenton was not officially replaced in the band unless the later references to Gustafson, Spenner, and Tibbs as official members of the band during their stints are changed to demonstrate that they were not.-->\n\nThe next album, ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'', was released in March 1973. It marked the beginning of the band's long, successful collaboration with producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]], who worked on all of the group's classic albums and singles in the 1970s.

Also, [[John Gustafson (musician)|John Gustafson]] became the band's bass player for the next three studio albums, but not always for live shows; though he toured with Roxy on certain dates in 1973 and 1975, other live Roxy bassists of this period (1973\u20131976) included Sal Maida, [[John Wetton]] and [[Rick Wills]].<ref>Stump, Paul \u2013 Unknown Pleasures: A Cultural biography of Roxy Music, Thunder's Mouth Press, New York, 1998, pps. 72, 154</ref>\n\nEno, meanwhile, was replaced by 18-year-old multi-instrumentalist [[Eddie Jobson]], formerly of [[progressive rock]]ers [[Curved Air]], who played keyboards and electric violin. Although some fans lamented the loss of the experimental attitude and camp aesthetic that Eno had brought to the band, the classically trained Jobson was an accomplished musician.  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to the albums ''[[Stranded (album)|Stranded]]'' (1973) and ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'' (1974) as marking \"the zenith of contemporary British art rock\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> The songs on these albums also cemented Ferry's persona as the epitome of the suave, jaded Euro-sophisticate. Although this persona undoubtedly began as a deliberately ironic device, during the mid-1970s it seemed to merge with Ferry's real life, as the working-class miner's son from the north of England became an international rock star and an icon of male style.\n\nOn the first two Roxy albums, all songs were written solely by Bryan Ferry. Beginning with ''Stranded'', Mackay and Manzanera began to co-write some material. Gradually, their songwriting and musicianship became more integrated into the band's sound, although Ferry remained the dominant songwriter; throughout their career, all but one of Roxy's singles were written either wholly or jointly by Ferry (Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson did individually write a few of the band's B-sides). ''Stranded'' was released in November 1973, and produced the top-10 single \"[[Street Life (Roxy Music song)|Street Life]]\".\n\nThe fourth album, ''Country Life'', was released in 1974, and was the first Roxy Music album to enter the US Top 40, albeit at No.&nbsp;37. ''Country Life'' was met with widespread critical acclaim, with ''Rolling Stone'' referring to it \"as if Ferry ran a cabaret for psychotics, featuring chanteurs in a state of shock\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite magazine|title=Albums Reviews: Roxy Music -Country Life|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=Jim|last=Miller|date=27 February 1975|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/123934/review/5943949/country_life|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415212253/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/123934/review/5943949/country_life|archive-date=15 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their fifth album, ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'', contained their only US top 40 hit, \"[[Love Is the Drug]]\". (Ferry said the song came to him while kicking the leaves during a walk through [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].){{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nAfter the concert tours in support of ''Siren'' in 1976, Roxy Music disbanded. Their live album ''[[Viva! (Roxy Music album)|Viva!]]'' was released in August 1976. During this time Ferry released two solo records on which Manzanera and Thompson performed, and Manzanera reunited with Eno on the critically acclaimed one-off ''[[801 Live]]'' album.\n\n===Final albums and hiatus (1978\u20131983)===\nRoxy Music reunited during 1978 to record a new album, ''[[Manifesto (Roxy Music album)|Manifesto]]'', but with a reshuffled cast. Jobson was reportedly not contacted for the reunion; at the time, Jobson was touring and recording with his own band, [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]] The sleeve of ''Manifesto'' indicated that the revived Roxy Music line-up consisted of Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson, along with [[Paul Carrack]] (ex-[[Ace (band)|Ace]], keyboards), [[Alan Spenner]] (ex-[[The Grease Band]], bass), and [[Gary Tibbs]] (ex-Vibrators, bass); despite this all other media pointed to Roxy Music being a quartet (and a trio following the 1980 departure of Thompson), with the latter three musicians being regular collaborators of the band.\n\nThree singles were issued from ''Manifesto'', including the major UK hits \"[[Angel Eyes (Roxy Music song)|Angel Eyes]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;4), and \"[[Dance Away]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;2). Both these tracks are significantly different from the album versions, as \"Dance Away\" was remixed for single release, and \"Angel Eyes\" was entirely re-recorded.\n\nAfter the tour and before the recording of the next album, ''[[Flesh and Blood (Roxy Music album)|Flesh + Blood]]'' (1980), Thompson broke his thumb in a motorcycle mishap and took a leave from the band. Soon afterward he left permanently, due to musical differences with Ferry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/interview-roxy-musics-paul-thompson-1449252|title=Interview: Roxy Music's Paul Thompson|date=6 February 2009|work=nechronicle}}</ref>\n\nAt this point, Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera became the only permanent members of Roxy Music, and were supplemented by a variety of session players over the next few years including Tibbs, Spenner, Carrack, drummer [[Andy Newmark]] and guitarist [[Neil Hubbard]]. The trio's 1980 album ''Flesh + Blood'' became a huge commercial success in their homeland, as the album went to No.&nbsp;1 on the UK charts, and spun off three UK hits: \"Oh Yeah\" (UK No.&nbsp;5), \"Over You\" (UK No.&nbsp;5), and \"Same Old Scene\" (UK No.&nbsp;12).\n\nHowever, the changed cast reflected a distinct change in Roxy's musical style. Gone were the unpredictable elements of the group's sound, giving way to smoother musical arrangements. ''Rolling Stone'' panned ''Manifesto'' (\"Roxy Music has not gone disco.

A cover of a song written and originally recorded by [[John Lennon]], Roxy Music recorded \"Jealous Guy\" as a tribute to Lennon after his 1980 death. The song topped the UK charts for two weeks in March 1981, becoming the band's only No.&nbsp;1 single.\n\nLater, with more sombre and carefully sculpted soundscapes, the band's eighth\u2014and final\u2014studio album, ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' (1982), recorded at [[Chris Blackwell]]'s [[Compass Point Studios]], was a major commercial success and restored the group's critical reputation<ref>(''Rolling Stone'': \"''Avalon'' takes a long time to kick in, but it finally does, and it's a good one.\")</ref> and contained the successful single \"[[More Than This (Roxy Music song)|More Than This]]\". The album also included several Roxy Music classics, such as \"Avalon\", \"The Main Thing\", \"The Space Between\", \"True to Life\", and \"To Turn You On\". The trio (augmented by session players) toured extensively until 1983, when Bryan Ferry dissolved the band, and band members devoted themselves full-time to solo careers.\n\n===Reunions (2001\u20132011, 2019, 2022)===\nFerry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson re-formed in 2001 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band, and toured extensively. A festival performance in Portugal and a short tour of the United States followed in 2003. Absent was Brian Eno, who criticised the motives of the band's reunion, saying, \"I just don't like the idea. It leaves a bad taste\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1185763.stm Eno attacks Roxy reunion], BBC News</ref> Later Eno remarked that his comment had been taken out of context. Manzanera and Thompson recorded and toured with Ferry on his 2002 album ''[[Frantic (album)|Frantic]]''. Eno also contributed to ''Frantic'' on the track \"I Thought\".\n\nDuring 2002, Image Entertainment, Inc., released the concert DVD ''Roxy Music Live at the Apollo'' featuring performances of 20 songs plus interviews and rehearsal footage.\n\nIn 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked the group No.&nbsp;98 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRoxy Music gave a live performance at the 2005 [[Isle of Wight Festival 2005|Isle of Wight Festival]] on 11 June 2005, their first UK concert since the 2001\u20132002 world tour. On 2 July 2005, the band played \"[[Jealous Guy]]\", \"Do the Strand\", and \"Love is the Drug\" at the Berlin contribution to [[Live8]]; \"Do the Strand\" is available on the 4-disc DVD collection, and \"Love Is the Drug\" can be found on the Live 8 Berlin DVD.\n\nIn March 2005, it was announced on Phil Manzanera's official site<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.manzanera.com| title=Phil Manzanera, Expression Records and the Roxy Music Archive| access-date=11 March 2006}}</ref> that the band, including Brian Eno, had decided to record an album of new material. The project would mark the first time Eno worked with Roxy Music since 1973's ''For Your Pleasure''. After a number of denials that he would be involved with any Roxy Music reunion, on 19 May 2006 Eno revealed that he had contributed two songs to the new album as well as playing keyboards on other tracks.

Ferry, Mackay and Eno all had studied at prominent UK art colleges during the mid-to-late 1960s, when these institutions were introducing courses that avoided traditional art teaching practice, with its emphasis on painting, and instead focused on more recent developments, most notably [[pop art]], and explored new concepts such as [[cybernetics]]. As writer Michael Bracewell notes in his book ''Roxy: The Band that Invented an Era'', Roxy Music was created expressly by Ferry, Mackay and Eno as a means of combining their mutual interests in music, modern art and fashion.\n\nFerry studied at [[Newcastle University]] in the Sixties under renowned [[pop art]]ist and educator [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], and many of Ferry's university friends, classmates and tutors \u2013 e.g. [[Rita Donagh]] and [[Tim Head]] \u2013 became well-known artists in their own right. Eno studied at [[Winchester School of Art]] and although his iconoclastic style became apparent early and caused some conflict with the college establishment, it also resulted in him meeting important artists and musicians including [[Cornelius Cardew]] and [[Gavin Bryars]]. His interest in electronic music also resulted in his first meetings with Andy Mackay, who was studying at Reading University and who had likewise developed a strong interest in avant garde and electronic music.\n\nThe three eventually joined forces in London during 1970\u201371 after meeting through mutual friends and decided to form a rock band.\n\nRoxy Music was initially influenced by other contemporary artists at the time including [[The Beatles]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[David Bowie]], [[Elton John]], [[The Animals]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[King Crimson]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[The Who]], as well as American rock'n'roll acts and genres such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Motown]]. Ferry stated that Roxy Music's unique sound came as a result of the diverse and eclectic musical backgrounds of the band's members; \"I had lots of musical influences, [[Phil Manzanera]] had this Latin heritage, being born in South America. Saxophone and oboe player [[Andy Mackay]] was classically trained. Eno with his deep interest in experimental music. They were specialists in their field. Paul Thompson brought a lot, with his very powerful, earthy drumming.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/01/bryan-ferry-roxy-music-invented-new-pop-game-for-anything |title=Bryan Ferry on how Roxy Music invented art pop: 'We were game for anything' |work=The Guardian |date=1 February 2018|access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/02/roxy-music-40-years |title=Roxy Music: the band that broke the sound barrier |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2012|access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nRoxy Music was one of the first rock music groups to create and maintain a carefully crafted look and style that included their stage presentation, music videos, album and single cover designs, and promotional materials such as posters, handbills, cards and badges.\nThey were assisted in this by a group of friends and associates who helped to sculpt the classic Roxy Music 'look', notably fashion designer [[Antony Price]], hair stylist Keith Mainwaring, photographer Karl Stoecker, the group's \"PR consultant\" Simon Puxley (a former university friend of Mackay's) and Ferry's art school classmate Nicholas De Ville. Well-known critic [[Lester Bangs]] went so far as to say that Roxy represented \"the triumph of artifice\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/roxy-music/2774 |title=Roxy Music \u2013 The Early Years \u2013 Album Reviews |work=Nme |date=2 September 2000 |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> Ferry later attributed the band's look to his interest in American music and popular culture icons including [[Marilyn Monroe]], Motown and [[Stax Records]] artists. He also stated he wanted to create an alternative image to publicity shots of pop and rock groups at the time which would feature artists \"in a dreary street, looking rather sullen. Which was the norm.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe band's self-titled debut album, produced by [[King Crimson]]'s [[Pete Sinfield]], was the first in a series of albums with increasingly sophisticated covers, with art direction by Ferry in collaboration with his friend Nick De Ville. The album artwork imitated the visual style of classic \"[[girlie magazine|girlie]]\" and [[fashion magazine]]s, featuring high-fashion shots of scantily clad models [[Amanda Lear]], [[Marilyn Cole]] and [[Jerry Hall]], each of whom had romances with Ferry during the time of their contributions, as well as model Kari-Ann Muller who appears on the cover of the first Roxy album but who was not otherwise involved with anyone in the band, and who later married [[Mick Jagger]]'s brother Chris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.librario.com/1123|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809141847/http://www.librario.com/1123|url-status=dead|title=These Vintage Years! \u2013 Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music \u2013 Kari-Ann|archive-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> The title of the fourth Roxy album, ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'', was intended as a parody of the well-known British rural magazine of the same name, and the visually punning front cover photo featured two models (two German fans, Constanze Karoli\u2014sister of [[Can (band)|Can]]'s [[Michael Karoli]]\u2014and Eveline Grunwald)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/ac26countrylife.html |title=Seventies' Greatest Album Covers: Country Life |publisher=Superseventies.com |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> clad only in semi-transparent lingerie standing against an evergreen hedge. As a result, in many areas of the United States the album was sold in an opaque plastic wrapper because retailers refused to display the cover. Later, an alternative cover, featuring just a picture of the forest, was used.\n\n==Legacy and influence==\nIn 2005, [[Tim de Lisle]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' argued that Roxy Music are the second most influential British band after [[the Beatles]]. He wrote, \"Somehow, in a landscape dominated by [[Led Zeppelin]] at one end and [[the Osmonds]] at the other, they managed to reach the Top 10 with a heady mixture of futurism, retro rock'n'roll, camp, funny noises, silly outfits, art techniques, film references and oboe solos.

Smith\", an Artists & Repertoire manager at [[Polydor Records]], in which \"Smith\"  patronisingly critiqued a demo tape that the group had submitted to the label. According to a 4 April 2021 item in the [https://www.treblezine.com/the-roxy-music-rejection-april-fools-joke-explained/ Treble e-zine], the letter was in fact an [[April Fool's Day]] prank which apparently originated from the Twitter account of former [[Talking Heads]]/[[Tom Tom Club]] drummer [[Chris Frantz]]. In May 2021, [[Tony Barrell (journalist)|Tony Barrell]], a British writer and Roxy Music fan, announced that he was the author of the letter.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tony Barrell
