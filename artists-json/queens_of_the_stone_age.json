The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist [[Josh Homme]], who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line-up changes. The current line-up consists of Homme alongside [[Troy Van Leeuwen]] (guitar, [[Lap steel guitar|lap steel]], keyboard, percussion, backing vocals), [[Michael Shuman]] (bass guitar, keyboard, backing vocals), [[Dean Fertita]] (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and [[Jon Theodore]] (drums, percussion).

Their [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self-titled debut album]] was recorded with former Kyuss members [[Alfredo Hern\u00e1ndez]] on drums and Homme on all other instruments. [[Nick Oliveri]] and [[Mark Lanegan]] joined as additional vocalists for [[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|''Rated R'']], which was commercially and critically successful, and featured their breakout single \"[[The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret]]\". ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]'' was released in 2002 to universal acclaim and commercial success, and featured [[Dave Grohl]] on drums and contributions from [[Alain Johannes]] and [[Natasha Shneider]]. Following Oliveri and Lanegan's departures, Homme was the primary singer for 2005's ''[[Lullabies to Paralyze]]'' and 2007's electronic-influenced [[Era Vulgaris (album)|''Era Vulgaris'']]. \n\nAfter a few years of inactivity, ''[[...Like Clockwork]]'' was released in 2013 and [[Villains (Queens of the Stone Age album)|''Villains'']] in 2017 with [[Mark Ronson]] as producer for the latter,<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> both of which received critical acclaim.\n\nThe band have been nominated for [[Grammy Award|Grammy Awards]] seven times; four times for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]], twice for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]], and once for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 23, 2020|title=Queens Of The Stone Age|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/queens-stone-age/8455|access-date=February 3, 2021|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and debut album (1996\u20131999)===\nAfter the breakup of his previous band, [[Kyuss]], in 1995, [[Josh Homme]] briefly joined [[Screaming Trees]] as a touring guitarist,<ref>{{cite web\n| url =http://www.thefade.net/oldsite/articles/roughedge98xxxx.html\n| title =Queens of the Stone Age Review\n| access-date =May 9, 2007\n| author =Christopher J.

In 1996 they released the eponymous ''[[Gamma Ray (EP)|Gamma Ray]]'' EP, featuring \"Born to Hula\" and \"If Only Everything\" (which would later appear on their self-titled debut as \"If Only\"). The EP featured [[Matt Cameron]] of [[Soundgarden]] and [[Pearl Jam]], Van Conner from Screaming Trees, and percussionist [[Victor Indrizzo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefade.net/oldsite/discography/gammaray.html|title=Discography entry for ''Gamma Ray''|website=thefade.net|access-date=May 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\nGamma Ray changed their name in 1997 after the German [[power metal]] band [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] threatened to sue. The name \"Queens of the Stone Age\" came from a nickname given to Kyuss by their producer [[Chris Goss]]. Homme said of the name: \"Kings would be too macho. The Kings of the Stone Age wear armor and have axes and wrestle. The Queens of the Stone Age hang out with the Kings of the Stone Age's girlfriends when they wrestle ... Rock should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls. That way everyone's happy and it's more of a party.

Homme played guitar and bass on the album (the latter credited to Homme's alter-ego Carlo Von Sexron), [[Alfredo Hern\u00e1ndez]] on the drums, and several other contributions by Chris Goss and Hutch. Homme reportedly asked Screaming Trees vocalist [[Mark Lanegan]] to appear on the record, but he was unable due to other commitments.<ref>[http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2008/01/03/mark-lanegan-the-man-comes-around/ Mark Lanegan: The Man Comes Around] \u2013 MAGNET Magazine Inc. 2011</ref>\n\nSoon after the recording sessions were finished for the album, former Kyuss bassist [[Nick Oliveri]] joined the group, and touring commenced with a band consisting entirely of ex-Kyuss members.
