Gaye relocated to Detroit with Fuqua where he signed with Tri-Phi Records as a session musician, playing drums on several Tri-Phi releases.

Starting in October 1962, Gaye performed as part of the [[Motortown Revue]], a series of concert tours headlined at the [[Northeastern United States|north]] and [[Southeastern United States|southeastern]] coasts of the United States as part of the [[Chitlin' Circuit]], a series of rock shows performed at venues that welcomed predominantly black musicians. A filmed performance of Gaye at the [[Apollo Theater]] took place in June 1963. Later that October, Tamla issued the live album, ''[[Marvin Gaye Recorded Live on Stage]]''. \"[[Can I Get a Witness]]\" became one of Gaye's early international successes.\n[[File:Marvin Gaye 1966 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Gaye in 1966|alt=|219x219px]]\n\nIn 1964, Gaye recorded a successful duet album with singer [[Mary Wells]] titled ''[[Together (Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells album)|Together]]'', which reached No. 42 on the pop album chart. The album's two-sided single, including \"[[Once Upon a Time (Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells song)|Once Upon a Time]]\" and '[[What's the Matter With You Baby]]\", each reached the top 20. Gaye's next solo success, \"[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)]]\", which [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]] wrote for him, reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 and reached the top 50 in the UK. Gaye started getting television exposure around this time, on shows such as ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Also in 1964, he appeared in the [[concert film]], ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]''. Gaye had two number-one R&B singles in 1965 with the [[The Miracles|Miracles]]\u2013[[musical composition|composed]] \"[[I'll Be Doggone]]\" and \"[[Ain't That Peculiar]]\". Both songs became million-sellers.

The song features a [[Wurlitzer electric piano|Wurlitzer]] piano, percussion, and horns. Gaye's recording of it paved the way for what later became \"[[psychedelic soul]]\".}}\n\nIn October 1967, Terrell collapsed in Gaye's arms during a performance in [[Farmville, Virginia]].{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=65}} Terrell was subsequently rushed to Farmville's Southside Community Hospital, where doctors discovered she had a malignant [[brain tumor|tumor in her brain]].{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=65}} The diagnosis ended Terrell's career as a [[live music|live performer]], though she continued to record music under careful supervision.

As writer [[Eddie Holland]] explained, \"He was the only singer I have ever heard known to take a song of that nature, that was so far removed from his natural voice where he liked singing, and do whatever it took to sell that song.\"{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=8}}\n\nIn songs such as \"Pride and Joy\", Gaye used three different vocal ranges\u2014singing in his baritone range at the beginning, bringing a lighter tenor in the verses before reaching a gospel mode in the chorus. Holland further stated of Gaye's voice that it was \"one of the sweetest and prettiest voices you ever wanted to hear\".{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=9}} And while he noted that ballads and jazz was \"his basic soul\", he stated Gaye \"had the ability to take a roughhouse, rock and roll, blues, R&B, any kind of song and make it his own\", later saying that Gaye was the most versatile vocalist he had ever worked with.{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=9}}\n\nGaye changed his vocal style in the late 1960s, when he was advised to use a sharper, raspy voice\u2014especially in Norman Whitfield's recordings. Gaye initially disliked the new style, considering it out of his range, but said he was \"into being produce-able\".{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=14}} After listening to David Ruffin and Levi Stubbs, Gaye said he started to develop what he called his \"tough man voice\"\u2014saying, \"I developed a growl.\"{{sfnm|Bowman|2006|1p=14|Ritz|1991|2p=100}} In the liner notes of his DVD set, ''Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981'', Rob Bowman said that by the early 1970s, Gaye had developed \"three distinct voices: his smooth, sweet tenor; a growling rasp; and an unreal [[falsetto]].\"{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=15}} Bowman further wrote that the recording of the ''What's Going On'' single was \"...the first single to utilize all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself.\"{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=15}} Bowman found that Gaye's multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles \"summon[ed] up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving\".{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=15}}\n\n===Social commentary and concept albums===\nPrior to recording the ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' album, Gaye recorded a cover of the song, \"[[Abraham, Martin & John]]\", which became a UK hit in 1970. Despite some political music and socially conscious material recorded by [[The Temptations]], Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social events such as the 1965 [[Watts riots]] and once asked himself, \"with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=156}} When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do [[protest music]], Gordy cautioned him, \"Marvin, don't be ridiculous. That's taking things too far.\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=157}}\n\nGaye was inspired by the [[Black Panther Party]] and supported the efforts they put forth such as giving free meals to poor families door to door. However, he did not support the violent tactics the Panthers used to fight oppression, as Gaye's messages in many of his political songs were [[nonviolent]]. The lyrics and music of ''What's Going On'' discuss and illustrate issues during the 1960s/1970s such as racism, police brutality, drug abuse, environmental issues, anti-war, and black power issues.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Party Music : The Inside Story of the Black Panthers' Band and How Black Power Transformed Soul Music|last = Vincet|first = Rickey|publisher = Lawrence Hill Books|year = 2013|pages = 288\u2013289}}</ref> Gaye was inspired to make this album because of events such as the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 race riots in Detroit]], and the [[Kent State shootings]], as well as the assassinations of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Bobby Kennedy]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |title=Things Aint Like What They Used to Be: Marvin Gaye and The Making of What's Going On |last=Charnock |first=Ruth |date=2015 |journal=United Academics Journal of Social Sciences |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120111436/http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |archive-date=November 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOnce Gaye presented Gordy with the ''What's Going On'' album, Gordy feared Gaye was risking the ruination of his image as a sex symbol.{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=16}} Following the album's success, Gaye tried a follow-up album, ''[[You're the Man (album)|You're the Man]]''. The [[You're the Man|title track]] only produced modest success, however, and Gaye and Motown shelved the album. Later on, several of Gaye's unreleased songs of social commentary, including \"[[The World Is Rated X]]\", would be issued on posthumous compilation albums. ''What's Going On'' would later be described by an [[AllMusic]] writer as an album that \"not only redefined soul music as a creative force but also expanded its impact as an agent for social change\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4344/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic (((Marvin Gaye \u2013 Overview)))|access-date=January 9, 2009}}</ref> ''You're the Man'' was finally released on March 29, 2019, through [[Motown]], [[Universal Music Enterprises]], and [[Universal Music Group]].<ref name=\"CoS\">{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/marvin-gaye-youre-the-man-official-release/|title=Marvin Gaye's lost 1972 album You're the Man to receive official release|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=Roffman|first=Michael|date=February 8, 2019|access-date=February 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124247/https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/marvin-gaye-youre-the-man-official-release/|archive-date=February 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe ''What's Going On'' album also provided another first in both Motown and R&B music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album in a [[song cycle]], segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R&B albums that traditionally included [[filler (music)|filler tracks]] to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Barry White]] making the concept album format a part of 1970s R&B music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. ''Let's Get It On'' repeated the suite-form arrangement of ''What's Going On'', as would Gaye's later albums such as ''I Want You'', ''Here, My Dear'' and ''In Our Lifetime''.\n\nAlthough Marvin Gaye was not politically active outside of his music, he became a public figure for social change and inspired/educated many people through his work.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nMarvin Gaye has been called \"the number-one purveyor of soul music\".{{sfn|Browne|2001|p=316}} In his book ''Mercy Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye'', [[Michael Eric Dyson]] described Gaye as someone \"who transcended the boundaries of [[rhythm and blues]] as no other performer had done before\".{{sfn|Dyson|2004|p=3}} Following his [[death of Marvin Gaye|death]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Gaye as someone who \"blended the soul music of the urban scene with the beat of the old-time gospel singer and became an influential force in pop music\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |title=Marvin Gaye Is Shot And Killed; Pop Singer's Father Faces Charge |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 1984 |access-date=March 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403100807/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further in the article, Gaye was also credited with combining \"the soulful directness of gospel music, the sweetness of soft-soul and pop, and the vocal musicianship of a jazz singer\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> His recordings for Motown in the 1960s and 1970s shaped that label's signature sound.
