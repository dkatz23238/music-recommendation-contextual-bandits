Their debut album, ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' (1969), remains their most commercially successful and influential release, with a potent mixture of [[jazz]], classical and [[experimental music]].<ref>[[#refBuckley2003|Buckley 2003]], p. 477, \"''Opening with the cataclysmic heavy-metal of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\", and closing with the cathedral-sized title track,''\"</ref> Following the sudden simultaneous departures of McDonald and Giles, Fripp and Sinfield assumed direction of the group for ''[[In the Wake of Poseidon]]'' (1970), ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'' (1970), and ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]'' (1971). In 1972, Fripp changed the group's instrumentation and approach, drawing from European free improvisation, and developing ever more complex compositions. They reached what some saw as a creative peak on ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'' (1973), ''[[Starless and Bible Black]]'' (1974), and ''[[Red (King Crimson album)|Red]]'' (1974). Fripp disbanded this group in 1974.\n\nIn 1981, Crimson reformed with another change in musical direction. For the first time a second guitarist (in the person of [[Adrian Belew]], who also sang his own lyrics) was included. They drew influence from African music, [[gamelan]], [[post-punk]] and New York [[Minimalist music|minimalism]]. This group lasted three years, resulting in the trio of albums ''[[Discipline (King Crimson album)|Discipline]]'' (1981), ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]'' (1982) and ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]]'' (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, Fripp revived the group as a sextet he called the \"double trio\" in 1994. This group participated in another three-year cycle of activity that included the release of ''[[Thrak]]'' (1995), and multiple concert recordings. There was a hiatus between 1997 to 2000. Four members of the previous sextet reunited in 2000 as a more [[Industrial music|industrial]]-oriented King Crimson,<ref name=\"stereogum2060790\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2060790/king-crimson-debut-album-50th-anniversary-review/reviews/the-anniversary/ |title=A Tribute To In The Court Of The Crimson King, Released 50 Years Ago Today |first=Phil |last=Freeman |date=10 October 2019 |website=stereogum.com |access-date=7 February 2021}}</ref> releasing ''[[The Construkction of Light]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Power to Believe]]'' (2003). After a five year hiatus, the group expanded (in the person of new second drummer [[Gavin Harrison]]) for a 2008 tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of their 1968 formation.\n\nFollowing another hiatus (2009\u20132012), during which Fripp was thought to be retired, King Crimson came together again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline, and new second guitarist and singer [[Jakko Jakszyk]]. This version of King Crimson continued to tour from 2014 to 2021, and released multiple live albums, rearranging and reinterpreting music from across the band's entire 50-year career for the first time.

Fripp was dissatisfied with the quality of the new music being developed by the band; Longstanding friction and disagreements between himself and Bruford led to the latter deciding to leave King Crimson for good. The resulting bad atmosphere and the lack of workable material almost broke the band up altogether. Instead, the six members opted to work in four smaller groups (or \"fraKctalisations\", as Fripp called them) known as [[ProjeKcts]]. This enabled the group to continue developing ideas and searching for a new direction without the practical difficulty (and expense) of convening all six musicians at once. From 1997 to 1999, the first four ProjeKcts played live in the United States and the United Kingdom, and released recordings that showed a high degree of free improvisation, with influences ranging from jazz, industrial, [[techno]] and [[drum'n'bass]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-beginners-guide-to-projekcts-mw0001890864 |title=King Crimson A Beginner's Guide to Projekcts |first=Lindsay|last= Planer |website=allmusic.com |access-date=22 February 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"kche9708\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/heaven-and-earth-live-and-in-the-studio-1997-2008 |title=King Crimson: Heaven & Earth: Live And In The Studio 1997-2008 |first=John |last=Kelman |date=8 June 2019 |website=[[All About Jazz]] |access-date=22 February 2021}}</ref> These have been collectively described by music critic [[J.
