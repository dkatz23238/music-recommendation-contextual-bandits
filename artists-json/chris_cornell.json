With Shepherd, the new line-up recorded ''[[Badmotorfinger]]'' in 1991. The album brought the band to a new level of commercial success, and Soundgarden found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene. ''Badmotorfinger'' included the singles \"[[Jesus Christ Pose]]\", \"[[Outshined]]\" and \"[[Rusty Cage]]\". The three singles gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations, while the videos for \"Outshined\" and \"Rusty Cage\" gained considerable airtime on MTV. The song \"Jesus Christ Pose\" and its music video was the subject of widespread controversy in 1991, and the video was removed from MTV's playlist. \"Rusty Cage\" was later covered by [[Johnny Cash]] on his 1996 album, ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]''. \"[[Room a Thousand Years Wide]]\" was released (along with the B-side \"HIV Baby\") as a 7\" single through Sub Pop's ''Single of the Month'' club a full year before the release of ''Badmotorfinger'', and later re-recorded for the album.

You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other.

So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great... I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear.

[[Jimi Hendrix]] could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to at different points in our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that's part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there's not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do a lot of different things with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness.\"<ref>{{YouTube|id=9buvTFxf2EA|title=Pearl Jam's Jeff Ament on Chris Cornell's death and depression}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his death, the sales and streams of Cornell's discography grew by more than 550% from the week prior to his death.
