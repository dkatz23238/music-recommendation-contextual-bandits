His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', combined songs in conventional [[rock and roll]] format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound [[collage]]s. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz, or classical.\n\nZappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed \"Project/Object\", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums.<ref name=\"semley2012\"/> His lyrics reflected his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so, and he has been described as the \"godfather\" of [[comedy rock]].<ref name=\"Comedy rock\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=November 14, 2020}}</ref> He was a strident critic of mainstream education and [[organized religion]], and a forthright and passionate advocate for [[freedom of speech]], [[autodidacticism|self-education]], political participation and the abolition of censorship. Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he disapproved of recreational drug use, but supported decriminalization and regulation.\n\nZappa was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while critics found it lacking emotional depth. He had greater commercial success outside the US, particularly in Europe. Though he worked as an [[independent music|independent artist]], Zappa mostly relied on distribution agreements he had negotiated with the major [[record labels]].

Living in the desert town of Lancaster, Zappa found this very exciting. Var\u00e8se invited him to visit if he ever came to New York.
