Some of the band's hit singles include \"[[Dreams (The Cranberries song)|Dreams]]\" (1992), \"[[Linger (The Cranberries song)|Linger]]\" (1993), \"[[Zombie (The Cranberries song)|Zombie]]\" (1994), \"[[Salvation (The Cranberries song)|Salvation]]\" (1996), and \"[[When You're Gone (The Cranberries song)|When You're Gone]]\" (1997).
