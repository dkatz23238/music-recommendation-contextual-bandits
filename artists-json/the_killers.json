Stoermer mostly retired from touring, citing both exhaustion from the road and lingering effects from a pyrotechnics accident, while Keuning has released a solo album. Despite his hiatus from touring, Stoermer has participated in recording sessions for ''Wonderful Wonderful'' and ''Imploding the Mirage'', and it was announced that Keuning was participating in recording ''[[Pressure Machine]]'', which was released on August 13, 2021. [[Ted Sablay]], who had served as a touring keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the band since 2006, assumed lead guitar duties for live shows in Keuning's absence, while touring rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jake Blanton took up the job of bassist and has taken Stoermer's place in live shows. With Sablay moving to lead guitar, the band hired Taylor Milne and Robbie Connolly to play rhythm guitar and keyboards live.\n\nThe Killers are considered one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century,<ref>{{cite news |last=Barlow |first=Eve |date=March 22, 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/22/brandon-flowers-killers-interview-album-the-desired-effect |title=Brandon Flowers on The Desired Effect: 'Every song on this album is a single' |work=The Guardian}}</ref> selling more than 28 million records worldwide, including 10.8 million in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.colours.cz/artists/the-killers|title=Colours of Ostrava - The Killers|website=Colours.cz|access-date=August 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9485339/killers-catalog-acquired-eldridge-publishing-deal/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social|title=The Killers' Catalog Acquired in Eldridge's First Music Publishing Deal|website=Billboard.com|access-date=November 21, 2020}}</ref> They have performed in over 50 countries and on six [[continent]]s, headlining venues such as [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Wembley Stadium]] and [[Glastonbury Festival]] (2007 and 2019).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\n\n===2001\u20132003: Origins and formation===\nIn 2001, [[Brandon Flowers]] was fired by his first band, a Utah [[synth-pop]] trio known as Blush Response.<ref name=lvw140405>{{cite news |last=Sculley |first=Alan |title=Brandon Flowers Speaks|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/archive/2005/apr/14/noise-brandon-flowers-speaks/|access-date=March 15, 2013 |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Weekly]] |date=April 14, 2005}}</ref> After attending an [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] concert at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel]] during [[The Tour of Brotherly Love]], Flowers realized his calling was to be in a rock band and began searching for like-minded musicians.<ref name=paste010605>{{cite news|last=Lanham|first=Tom|title=Oasis \u2013 Brit-Rock 'n' Role Models|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2005/06/oasis.html|access-date=March 16, 2013|newspaper=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=June 1, 2005}}</ref> He eventually came across an ad posted in a Las Vegas newspaper by [[Dave Keuning]], a 25-year-old guitarist who had moved to Vegas from [[Iowa]] a year earlier.

Vannucci was well known on the Las Vegas music scene, having played in numerous bands since he was young.

The band were keen on Stoermer joining them on a permanent basis, but he was initially reluctant to commit.

Stoermer mentioned later on that he could also play bass.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7454384/killers-mark-stoermer-interview-are-your-stars-out-video-premiere|title=Killers Mark Stoermer Interview |magazine=Billboard |access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> The band had continued as a three-piece trying out other bassists until November 2002, when Stoermer eventually accepted the invitation to join.
