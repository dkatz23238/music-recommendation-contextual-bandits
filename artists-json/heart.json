One valve lies between each atrium and ventricle, and one valve rests at the exit of each ventricle.<ref name=CNX2014/>\n\nThe valves between the atria and ventricles are called the atrioventricular valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the [[tricuspid valve]]. The tricuspid valve has three cusps,{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|pp=966\u2013967}} which connect to [[chordae tendinae]] and three [[papillary muscle]]s named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions.{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|pp=966\u2013967}} The [[mitral valve]] lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. It is also known as the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=970}}\n\nThe papillary muscles extend from the walls of the heart to valves by cartilaginous connections called chordae tendinae. These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when they close.<ref>{{cite web|author1=University of Minnesota|title=Papillary Muscles|url=http://www.vhlab.umn.edu/atlas/left-ventricle/papillary-muscles/index.shtml|website=Atlas of Human Cardiac Anatomy|access-date=7 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317203756/http://www.vhlab.umn.edu/atlas/left-ventricle/papillary-muscles/index.shtml|archive-date=17 March 2016}}</ref> During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight. As the heart chambers contract, so do the papillary muscles. This creates tension on the chordae tendineae, helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown back into the atria.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> {{efn|Note the muscles do '''not''' cause the valves to open. The pressure difference between the blood in the atria and the ventricles does this.}}{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|pp=966\u2013967}}\n\nTwo additional semilunar valves sit at the exit of each of the ventricles. The [[pulmonary valve]] is located at the base of the [[pulmonary artery]]. This has three cusps which are not attached to any papillary muscles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. The semilunar [[aortic valve]] is at the base of the [[aorta]] and also is not attached to papillary muscles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\n====Right heart====\n{{anchor|Right heart}}\nThe right heart consists of two chambers, the right atrium and the right ventricle, separated by a valve, the [[tricuspid valve]].<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThe right atrium receives blood almost continuously from the body's two major [[vein]]s, the [[Superior vena cava|superior]] and [[Inferior vena cava|inferior]] [[Vena cava|venae cavae]]. A small amount of blood from the coronary circulation also drains into the right atrium via the [[coronary sinus]], which is immediately above and to the middle of the opening of the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the [[fossa ovalis (heart)|fossa ovalis]], which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the [[Foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]].<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of [[pectinate muscle]]s, which are also present in the [[right atrial appendage]].<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThe right atrium is connected to the right ventricle by the tricuspid valve.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> The walls of the right ventricle are lined with [[trabeculae carneae]], ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. In addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the [[moderator band]] reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction. It arises from the lower part of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> The right ventricle tapers into the [[pulmonary trunk]], into which it ejects blood when contracting. The pulmonary trunk branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries that carry the blood to each lung. The pulmonary valve lies between the right heart and the pulmonary trunk.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\n====Left heart====\n{{anchor|left heart}}\nThe left heart has two chambers: the left atrium and the left ventricle, separated by the [[mitral valve]].<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThe left atrium receives oxygenated blood back from the lungs via one of the four [[pulmonary vein]]s. The left atrium has an outpouching called the [[left atrial appendage]]. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by [[pectinate muscles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/pectinate+muscle|title=pectinate muscle|publisher=The Free Dictionary|access-date=2016-07-31|archive-date=23 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823131849/https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/pectinate+muscle|url-status=live}}</ref> The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThe left ventricle is much thicker as compared with the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has [[trabeculae carneae]], but there is no [[moderator band]]. The left ventricle pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the [[heart muscle]]; the [[left coronary artery]] is above the left cusp of the valve, and the [[right coronary artery]] is above the right cusp.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\n===Wall===\n{{Further|Cardiac muscle}}\n[[File:2004 Heart Wall.jpg|thumb|Layers of the heart wall, including visceral and parietal pericardium]]\n\nThe heart wall is made up of three layers: the inner [[endocardium]], middle [[myocardium]] and outer [[epicardium]]. These are surrounded by a double-membraned sac called the pericardium.\n\nThe innermost layer of the heart is called the endocardium. It is made up of a lining of [[simple squamous epithelium]] and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the [[endothelium]] of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> The endocardium, by secreting [[endothelins]], may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\n[[File:2006 Heart Musculature.jpg|200px|thumbnail|The swirling pattern of myocardium helps the heart pump effectively]]The middle layer of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the [[cardiac muscle]]\u2014a layer of involuntary [[striated muscle tissue]] surrounded by a framework of [[collagen]]. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels and the inner muscles, forming a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceeding toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThere are two types of cells in cardiac muscle: [[cardiomyocyte|muscle cells]] which have the ability to contract easily, and [[cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker cells]] of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These contractile cells are connected by [[intercalated disc]]s which allow a rapid response to impulses of [[cardiac action potential|action potential]] from the pacemaker cells.

This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes [[artery|arteries]], [[vein]]s, and [[lymph vessel|lymphatic vessels]]. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nHeart tissue receives blood from two arteries which arise just above the aortic valve. These are the [[left main coronary artery]] and the [[right coronary artery]]. The left main coronary artery splits shortly after leaving the aorta into two vessels, the [[left anterior descending]] and the [[left circumflex artery]]. The left anterior descending artery supplies heart tissue and the front, outer side, and septum of the left ventricle. It does this by branching into smaller arteries\u2014diagonal and septal branches. The left circumflex supplies the back and underneath of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery supplies the right atrium, right ventricle, and lower posterior sections of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery also supplies blood to the atrioventricular node (in about 90% of people) and the sinoatrial node (in about 60% of people). The right coronary artery runs in a groove at the back of the heart and the left anterior descending artery runs in a groove at the front. There is significant variation between people in the anatomy of the arteries that supply the heart {{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=525}} The arteries divide at their furthest reaches into smaller branches that join at the edges of each arterial distribution.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThe [[coronary sinus]] is a large vein that drains into the right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the [[great cardiac vein]] (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the [[posterior cardiac vein]] (draining the back of the left ventricle), the [[middle cardiac vein]] (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and [[small cardiac vein]]s.{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=981}} The [[anterior cardiac veins]] drain the front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nSmall lymphatic networks called [[plexus]]es exist beneath each of the three layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the [[inferior tracheobronchial node]]. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=982}}\n\n===Nerve supply===\n[[File:2032 Automatic Innervation.jpg|thumb|Autonomic innervation of the heart]]\nThe heart receives nerve signals from the [[vagus nerve]] and from nerves arising from the [[sympathetic trunk]]. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. [[Sympathetic nervous system|Sympathetic nerves]] also influence the force of heart contraction.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=526}} Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired [[cardiovascular centre]]s in the [[medulla oblongata]]. The vagus nerve of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the [[sympathetic trunk]] act to increase the heart rate.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the [[cardiac plexus]].<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=982}}\n\nThe vagus nerve is a long, wandering nerve that emerges from the [[brainstem]] and provides parasympathetic stimulation to a large number of organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart.{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=945}} The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 [[thoracic ganglia]] and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, as well as to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter [[norepinephrine]] (also known as [[noradrenaline]]) at the [[neuromuscular junction]] of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of [[cation|positively charged ions]].<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> Norepinephrine binds to the [[beta-1 adrenergic receptor|beta\u20131 receptor]].<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\n==Development==\n{{anchor|Early development|Heart development|Development|Embryology}}\n{{main|Heart development|Human embryogenesis}}\n[[File:2037 Embryonic Development of Heart.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Development of the human heart during the first eight weeks (top) and the formation of the heart chambers (bottom).

This early start is crucial for subsequent embryonic and [[prenatal development]].\n\nThe heart derives from [[splanchnopleuric mesenchyme]] in the neural plate which forms the [[cardiogenic region]]. Two [[endocardial tubes]] form here that fuse to form a primitive heart tube known as the [[tubular heart]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/GrossAnatomy/thorax0/heartdev/main_fra.html |title=Main Frame Heart Development |publisher=Meddean.luc.edu |access-date=2010-10-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011116192836/http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/meded/grossanatomy/thorax0/heartdev/main_fra.html |archive-date=16 November 2001}}</ref> Between the third and fourth week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the formation of the septa and the valves and the remodeling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week, the septa are complete, and by the ninth week, the heart valves are complete.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nBefore the fifth week, there is an opening in the fetal heart known as the [[Foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the [[septum primum]] that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale was, called the fossa ovalis.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThe [[embryo]]nic heart begins beating at around 22 days after conception (5 weeks after the last normal menstrual period, LMP). It starts to beat at a rate near to the mother's which is about 75\u201380 [[beats per minute]] (bpm). The embryonic heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165\u2013185 bpm early in the early 7th week (early 9th week after the LMP).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DuBose |first1=T.

This circulation consists of the [[systemic circulation]] to and from the body and the [[pulmonary circulation]] to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges [[carbon dioxide]] for oxygen in the lungs through the process of [[breathing|respiration]]. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThe [[Heart#Right heart|right heart]] collects deoxygenated blood from two large veins, the [[superior vena cava|superior]] and [[inferior vena cava|inferior]] [[venae cavae]]. Blood collects in the right and left atrium continuously.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> The superior vena cava drains blood from above the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and to the middle of the opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> Additionally, the [[coronary sinus]] returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the [[tricuspid valve]] into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches [[capillaries]]. As these pass by [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] carbon dioxide is [[gas exchange|exchanged]] for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of [[diffusion]].\n\nIn the [[Heart#Left heart|left heart]], oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the [[mitral valve]] and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, [[arteriole]]s, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into [[venule]]s and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.\n\n====Cardiac cycle====\n{{main|Cardiac cycle|Systole|Diastole}}\n[[File:2027 Phases of the Cardiac Cycle.jpg|thumb|The cardiac cycle as correlated to the ECG]]\n\nThe cardiac cycle is the sequence of events in which the heart contracts and relaxes with every heartbeat.{{sfn|Guyton & Hall|2011|pp=105\u2013107}} The period of time during which the ventricles contract, forcing blood out into the aorta and main pulmonary artery, is known as [[systole]], while the period during which the ventricles relax and refill with blood is known as [[diastole]]. The atria and ventricles work in concert, so in systole when the ventricles are contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting blood. When the ventricles are relaxed in diastole, the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles. This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of the cardiac cycle, the ventricles are relaxing. As they do so, they are filled by blood passing through the open [[Mitral valve|mitral]] and [[Tricuspid valve|tricuspid]] valves. After the ventricles have completed most of their filling, the atria contract, forcing further blood into the ventricles and priming the pump. Next, the ventricles start to contract. As the pressure rises within the cavities of the ventricles, the mitral and tricuspid valves are forced shut. As the pressure within the ventricles rises further, exceeding the pressure with the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves open. Blood is ejected from the heart, causing the pressure within the ventricles to fall. Simultaneously, the atria refill as blood flows into the right atrium through the superior and [[inferior vena cava]]e, and into the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Finally, when the pressure within the ventricles falls below the pressure within the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves close. The ventricles start to relax, the mitral and tricuspid valves open, and the cycle begins again.{{sfn|Guyton & Hall|2011|pp=105\u2013107}}\n\n====Cardiac output====\n{{main|Cardiac output}}\n[[File:2029 Cardiac Cycle vs Heart Sounds.jpg|thumb|The x-axis reflects time with a recording of the heart sounds. The y-axis represents pressure.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>]]\nCardiac output (CO) is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle (stroke volume) in one minute. This is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume (SV) by the beats per minute of the heart rate (HR). So that: CO = SV x HR.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\nThe cardiac output is normalized to body size through [[body surface area]] and is called the [[cardiac index]].\n\nThe average cardiac output, using an average stroke volume of about 70mL, is 5.25 L/min, with a normal range of 4.0\u20138.0 L/min.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> The stroke volume is normally measured using an [[echocardiogram]] and can be influenced by the size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, [[sex]], [[Myocardial contractility|contractility]], duration of contraction, [[preload (cardiology)|preload]] and [[afterload]].<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\n[[Preload (cardiology)|Preload]] refers to the filling pressure of the atria at the end of diastole, when the ventricles are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill: if the ventricles contract more frequently, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the [[Frank-Starling mechanism]]. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.<ref name=\"CNX2014\" />{{sfn|Guyton & Hall|2011|pp=110\u2013113}}\n\n[[Afterload]], or how much pressure the heart must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by [[vascular resistance]]. It can be influenced by narrowing of the heart valves ([[stenosis]]) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThe strength of heart muscle contractions controls the stroke volume. This can be influenced positively or negatively by agents termed [[inotropes]].<ref name=\"BERRY2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=William|last2=McKenzie|first2=Catherine|title=Use of inotropes in critical care|journal=Clinical Pharmacist|date=1 January 2010|volume=2|pages=395|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/learning/learning-article/use-of-inotropes-in-critical-care/11049283.article|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128052534/http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/learning/learning-article/use-of-inotropes-in-critical-care/11049283.article|archive-date=28 November 2016}}</ref> These agents can be a result of changes within the body, or be given as drugs as part of treatment for a medical disorder, or as a form of [[life support]], particularly in [[intensive care unit]]s.

The prepotential accounts for the membrane reaching threshold and initiates the spontaneous depolarization and contraction of the cell; there is no resting potential.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>]]\n\nThe normal [[resting heart rate]] is called the [[sinus rhythm]], created and sustained by the [[sinoatrial node]], a group of pacemaking cells found in the wall of the right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an [[action potential]]. The [[cardiac action potential]] is created by the movement of specific [[electrolyte]]s into and out of the pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.{{sfn|Guyton & Hall|2011|pp=115\u2013120}}\n\nWhen the sinoatrial cells are resting, they have a negative charge on their membranes. A rapid influx of [[sodium]] ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive; this is called [[depolarisation]] and occurs spontaneously.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and [[calcium]] ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which [[potassium]] begins to leave it. All the ions travel through [[ion channels]] in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium start to move out of and into the cell only once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called [[voltage-gated calcium channel|voltage-gated]]. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and [[potassium channels]] open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called [[repolarization]]. When the membrane potential reaches approximately \u221260 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may begin again.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\nThe ions move from areas where they are concentrated to where they are not. For this reason sodium moves into the cell from outside, and potassium moves from within the cell to outside the cell. Calcium also plays a critical role. Their influx through slow channels means that the sinoatrial cells have a prolonged \"plateau\" phase when they have a positive charge. A part of this is called the [[absolute refractory period]]. Calcium ions also combine with the regulatory protein [[troponin C]] in the [[troponin complex]] to enable [[muscle contraction|contraction]] of the cardiac muscle, and separate from the protein to allow relaxation.<ref name=\"davis\">{{cite journal| title=Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange with troponin C and cardiac muscle dynamics |last1=Davis |first1=J.

Through a series of reflexes these help regulate and sustain blood flow.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\n<!--Baroreceptors-->Baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the [[aortic sinus]], [[carotid body|carotid bodies]], the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Baroreceptors fire at a rate determined by how much they are stretched,{{sfn|Guyton & Hall|2011|p=208}} which is influenced by blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or [[Bainbridge reflex]], associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase heart rate. The opposite is also true.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> Chemoreceptors present in the carotid body or adjacent to the aorta in an aortic body respond to the blood's oxygen, carbon dioxide levels. Low oxygen or high carbon dioxide will stimulate firing of the receptors.{{sfn|Guyton & Hall|2011|p=212}}\n\n<!--Other-->Exercise and fitness levels, age, body temperature, [[basal metabolic rate]], and even a person's emotional state can all affect the heart rate. High levels of the hormones [[epinephrine]], norepinephrine, and [[thyroid hormone]]s can increase the heart rate.

Heart failure is the result of many diseases affecting the heart, but is most commonly associated with [[Coronary artery disease|ischaemic heart disease]], [[valvular heart disease]], or high blood pressure. Less common causes include various [[Cardiomyopathy|cardiomyopathies]]. Heart failure is frequently associated with weakness of the heart muscle in the ventricles (systolic heart failure), but can also be seen in patients with heart muscle that is strong but stiff (diastolic heart failure). The condition may affect the left ventricle (causing predominantly breathlessness), the right ventricle (causing predominantly swelling of the legs and an elevated [[jugular venous pressure]]), or both ventricles. Patients with heart failure are at higher risk of developing dangerous heart rhythm disturbances or [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmias]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Cardiomyopathies ====<!-- Cardiomyopathy -->\n{{main|Cardiomyopathy}}Cardiomyopathies are diseases affecting the muscle of the heart. Some cause abnormal thickening of the heart muscle ([[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]), some cause the heart to abnormally expand and weaken ([[dilated cardiomyopathy]]), some cause the heart muscle to become stiff and unable to fully relax between contractions ([[restrictive cardiomyopathy]]) and some make the heart prone to abnormal heart rhythms ([[arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy]]). These conditions are often genetic and can be [[Inherited disease|inherited]], but some such as dilated cardiomyopathy may be caused by damage from toxins such as alcohol.

Diseased heart valves may have a narrow opening and therefore restrict the flow of blood in the forward direction (referred to as a [[Aortic stenosis|stenotic valve]]), or may allow blood to leak in the reverse direction (referred to as [[valvular regurgitation]]). Valvular heart disease may cause breathlessness, blackouts, or chest pain, but may be asymptomatic and only detected on a routine examination by hearing abnormal heart sounds or a [[heart murmur]]. In the developed world, valvular heart disease is most commonly caused by degeneration secondary to old age, but may also be caused by infection of the heart valves ([[endocarditis]]). In some parts of the world [[Rheumatic Heart Disease|rheumatic heart disease]] is a major cause of valvular heart disease, typically leading to mitral or aortic stenosis and caused by the body's immune system reacting to a [[Group A streptococcal infection|streptococcal]] throat infection.<ref name=\":4\" />{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=612\u201313}}\n\n==== Cardiac arrhythmias ====<!-- Abnormalities of rhythm-->\n{{main|Arrhythmia}}\n{{Listen|filename=Extremely_irregular_heart_sounds.wav|title=An irregular heartbeat|description=Recording of heart sounds from a 16-year-old girl with a cardiac arrhythmia.|pos=[[wav]]}}\nWhile in the healthy heart, waves of electrical impulses originate in the [[Sinoatrial node|sinus node]] before spreading to the rest of the atria, the [[atrioventricular node]], and finally the ventricles (referred to as a [[Sinus rhythm|normal sinus rhythm]]), this normal rhythm can be disrupted. Abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias may be asymptomatic or may cause palpitations, blackouts, or breathlessness. Some types of arrhythmia such as [[atrial fibrillation]] increase the long term risk of [[stroke]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSome arrhythmias cause the heart to beat abnormally slowly, referred to as a [[bradycardia]] or bradyarrhythmia. This may be caused by an [[Sick sinus syndrome|abnormally slow sinus node]] or damage within the cardiac conduction system ([[heart block]]).<ref name=\":1\" /> In other arrhythmias the heart may beat abnormally rapidly, referred to as a [[tachycardia]] or tachyarrhythmia. These arrhythmias can take many forms and can originate from different structures within the heart\u2014some arise from the atria (e.g. [[atrial flutter]]), some from the atrioventricular node (e.g. [[AV nodal reentrant tachycardia|AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia]]) whilst others arise from the ventricles (e.g. [[ventricular tachycardia]]). Some tachyarrhythmias are caused by scarring within the heart (e.g. some forms of [[ventricular tachycardia]]), others by an irritable focus (e.g. focal [[atrial tachycardia]]), while others are caused by additional abnormal conduction tissue that has been present since birth (e.g. [[Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome|Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]]).

This condition typically causes chest pain that may spread to the back, and is often caused by a viral infection ([[Infectious mononucleosis|glandular fever]], [[cytomegalovirus]], or [[coxsackievirus]]). Fluid can build up within the pericardial sac, referred to as a [[pericardial effusion]]. Pericardial effusions often occur secondary to pericarditis, kidney failure, or tumours, and frequently do not cause any symptoms. However, large effusions or effusions which accumulate rapidly can compress the heart in a condition known as [[cardiac tamponade]], causing breathlessness and potentially fatal low blood pressure. Fluid can be removed from the pericardial space for diagnosis or to relieve tamponade using a syringe in a procedure called [[pericardiocentesis]].{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=638\u2013639}}\n\n==== Congenital heart disease ====<!--Congenital disease-->\n{{main|Congenital heart defect}}\nSome people are born with hearts that are abnormal and these abnormalities are known as congenital heart defects. They may range from the relatively minor (e.g. [[patent foramen ovale]], arguably a variant of normal) to serious life-threatening abnormalities (e.g. [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]]). Common abnormalities include those that affect the heart muscle that separates the two side of the heart (a \"hole in the heart\", e.g. [[ventricular septal defect]]). Other defects include those affecting the heart valves (e.g. [[Aortic stenosis|congenital aortic stenosis]]), or the main blood vessels that lead from the heart (e.g. [[coarctation of the aorta]]). More complex syndromes are seen that affect more than one part of the heart (e.g. [[Tetralogy of Fallot]]).\n\nSome congenital heart defects allow blood that is low in oxygen that would normally be returned to the lungs to instead be pumped back to the rest of the body. These are known as [[Cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic congenital heart defects]] and are often more serious. Major congenital heart defects are often picked up in childhood, shortly after birth, or even before a child is born (e.g. [[Transposition of the great vessels|transposition of the great arteries]]), causing breathlessness and a lower rate of growth. More minor forms of congenital heart disease may remain undetected for many years and only reveal themselves in adult life (e.g., [[atrial septal defect]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Helmut|last2=Bonhoeffer|first2=Philipp|last3=De Groot|first3=Natasja M.

The [[first heart sound]] S1, is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as \"lub\". The [[second heart sound]], S2, is the sound of the semilunar valves closing during ventricular diastole and is described as \"dub\".<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> Each sound consists of two components, reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close.<ref name=\"TC2014\">{{cite book|title=Clinical Examination|last1=Talley|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=O'Connor|first2=Simon|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=978-0-7295-4198-5|pages=76\u201382|year=2013}}</ref> S2 may [[split S2|split]] into two distinct sounds, either as a result of inspiration or different valvular or cardiac problems.<ref name=TC2014/> Additional heart sounds may also be present and these give rise to [[gallop rhythm]]s. A [[third heart sound]], S3 usually indicates an increase in ventricular blood volume. A [[fourth heart sound]] S4 is referred to as an atrial gallop and is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff ventricle. The combined presence of S3 and S4 give a quadruple gallop.<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/>\n\n[[Heart murmur]]s are abnormal heart sounds which can be either related to disease or benign, and there are several kinds.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=556\u2013559}} There are normally two heart sounds, and abnormal heart sounds can either be extra sounds, or \"murmurs\" related to the flow of blood between the sounds. Murmurs are graded by volume, from 1 (the quietest), to 6 (the loudest), and evaluated by their relationship to the heart sounds, position in the cardiac cycle, and additional features such as their radiation to other sites, changes with a person's position, the frequency of the sound as determined by the side of the [[stethoscope]] by which they are heard, and site at which they are heard loudest.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=556\u2013559}} Murmurs may be caused by [[Valvular heart disease|damaged heart valves]] or congenital heart disease such as [[ventricular septal defect]]s, or may be heard in normal hearts. A different type of sound, a [[pericardial friction rub]] can be heard in cases of pericarditis where the inflamed membranes can rub together.\n\n====Blood tests====\nBlood tests play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of many cardiovascular conditions.\n\n<!--Specific tests-->[[Troponin]] is a sensitive [[biomarker]] for a heart with insufficient blood supply.

A test for [[brain natriuretic peptide]] (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered [[biomarker]]s because they are highly specific for cardiac disease.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=531}} Testing for the [[CK-MB|MB form of creatine kinase]] provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=1534}}\n\n<!--General tests-->Other blood tests are often taken to help understand a person's general health and risk factors that may contribute to heart disease. These often include a [[full blood count]] investigating for [[anaemia]], and [[basic metabolic panel]] that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A [[coagulation screen]] is often required to ensure that the right level of anticoagulation is given. [[Lipid profile|Fasting lipids]] and [[fasting blood glucose]] (or an [[HbA1c]] level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's [[cholesterol]] and diabetes status, respectively.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=521\u2013640}}\n\n====Electrocardiogram====\n{{main|Electrocardiography}}\n[[File:2028 Cardiac Cycle vs Electrocardiogram.jpg|thumb|Cardiac cycle shown against ECG]]\nUsing surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the electrical activity of the heart. This tracing of the electrical signal is the electrocardiogram (ECG) or (EKG). An ECG is a [[bedside test]] and involves the placement of ten leads on the body. This produces a \"12 lead\" ECG (three extra leads are calculated mathematically, and one lead is [[Ground (electricity)|electrically ground]], or earthed).{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=528\u2013530}}\n\nThere are five prominent features on the ECG: the [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P wave]] (atrial depolarisation), the [[QRS complex]] (ventricular depolarisation){{efn|Depolarisation of the ventricles occurs concurrently, but is not significant enough to be detected on an ECG.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=528\u2013530}}\n}} and the [[T wave]] (ventricular repolarisation).<ref name=\"CNX2014\"/> As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge (\"depolarising\") in the direction of that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative (\"repolarising\") in the direction of the lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting [[arrythmia|rhythm disturbances]] and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=528\u2013530}} Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. [[Cardiac stress test|Testing when exercising]] can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour [[Holter monitor]] if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=528\u2013530}}\n\n====Imaging====\n{{Main|Cardiac imaging}}\nSeveral [[medical imaging|imaging]] methods can be used to assess the anatomy and function of the heart, including [[ultrasound]] ([[echocardiography]]), [[angiography]], [[CT scan|CT]], [[MRI]], and [[Positron emission tomography|PET, scans]]. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ([[Transthoracic echocardiogram|transthoracic]]), or by a probe in the [[esophagus]] ([[Transesophageal echocardiogram|transesophageal]]). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any [[stenosis]], whether there is any backflow of blood ([[Regurgitation (circulation)|regurgitation]]) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an [[ejection fraction]], which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Armstrong, William F.|author2=Ryan, Thomas|author3=Feigenbaum, Harvey|title=Feigenbaum's Echocardiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LebU6zLrA8gC|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-9557-9|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423224258/https://books.google.com/books?id=LebU6zLrA8gC|archive-date=23 April 2016}}</ref> Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply.

The form and function of these hearts are different than mammalian hearts due to the fact that snakes have an elongated body, and thus are affected by different environmental factors.

This allows for some degree of separation between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered to the rest of the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other [[tetrapod]]s. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the [[conus arteriosus]] have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.<ref name=VB />\n\n=== Full division ===\n[[Archosaur]]s ([[crocodilia]]ns and [[bird]]s) and [[mammal]]s show complete separation of the heart into two pumps for a total of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals.

(In [[tetrapod]]s, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the [[ascending aorta]], while the other forms the pulmonary artery).<ref name=VB />\n\nIn the adult fish, the four chambers are not arranged in a straight row but instead form an S-shape, with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simple pattern is found in [[cartilaginous fish]] and in the [[ray-finned fish]]. In [[teleost]]s, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any [[amniote]]s, presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.<ref name=VB />\n\n===Invertebrates===\n[[File:Structural organization of the heart of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae - image.ppat.v08.i11.g001.png|thumb|The tube-like heart (green) of the mosquito ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' extends horizontally across the body, interlinked with the diamond-shaped [[insect wing#Muscles|wing muscles]] (also green) and surrounded by [[pericardium|pericardial cells]] (red).

In this system, deoxygenated blood collects around the heart in cavities ([[:wikt:sinus|sinuses]]). This blood slowly permeates the heart through many small one-way channels. The heart then pumps the blood into the [[hemocoel]], a cavity between the organs. The heart in arthropods is typically a muscular tube that runs the length of the body, under the back and from the base of the head. Instead of blood the circulatory fluid is [[haemolymph]] which carries the most commonly used [[respiratory pigment]], copper-based [[haemocyanin]] as the oxygen transporter. Haemoglobin is only used by a few arthropods.<ref name=SOLOMON2010>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdQ8AAAAQBAJ|title=Biology|last1=Solomon|first1=Eldra|last2=Berg|first2=Linda|last3=Martin|first3=Diana W.|year=2010|page=939|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-17032-7|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206054642/https://books.google.com/books?id=qdQ8AAAAQBAJ|archive-date=6 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn some other invertebrates such as [[earthworm]]s, the circulatory system is not used to transport oxygen and so is much reduced, having no veins or arteries and consisting of two connected tubes. Oxygen travels by diffusion and there are five small muscular vessels that connect these vessels that contract at the front of the animals that can be thought of as \"hearts\".<ref name=SOLOMON2010/>\n\n[[Cephalopod|Squids and other cephalopods]] have two \"gill hearts\" also known as [[branchial heart]]s, and one \"systemic heart\". The branchial hearts have two atria and one ventricle each, and pump to the [[gill]]s, whereas the systemic heart pumps to the body.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet our animals|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/Invertebrates/facts/cephalopods/default.cfm|website=Smithsonian National Zoological Park|access-date=14 August 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729081825/https://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/Invertebrates/Facts/cephalopods/default.cfm|archive-date=29 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Prosser1991\">{{cite book|vauthors=Ladd, Prosser C|title=Comparative Animal Physiology, Environmental and Metabolic Animal Physiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fQvbFlQBaQC&pg=PA537|year=1991|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-85767-9|pages=537\u2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206215610/https://books.google.com/books?id=7fQvbFlQBaQC&pg=PA537|archive-date=6 December 2016}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\nOnly the [[chordates]] (including vertebrates) and the [[hemichordates]] have a central \"heart\", which is a vesicle formed from the thickening of the [[aorta]] and contracts to pump blood.
