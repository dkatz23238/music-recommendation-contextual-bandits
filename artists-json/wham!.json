This was reflected in their earliest singles which, part-parody, part-social comment, briefly earned Wham! a reputation as a dance protest group.\n\nThe debut record to be released by the band was \"Wham Rap!\" in June 1982. It was a double A-side including the Social Mix and the Unsocial Mix. The record was not playlisted by BBC Radio 1 in the UK, partly because of the profanity in the Unsocial Mix.

Lee began her work with [[Paul Weller]] in [[the Style Council]], and was replaced by [[Helen DeMacque|Helen 'Pepsi' DeMacque]]. Holliman and DeMacque would later record as [[Pepsi & Shirlie]].\n\nWham! followed up \"Young Guns (Go for It)\" with a reissue of \"Wham Rap (Enjoy What You Do)\", \"[[Bad Boys (Wham! song)|Bad Boys]]\" and \"[[Club Tropicana]]\". By the end of 1983, Wham! were competing against pop rivals [[Culture Club]] and [[Duran Duran]] as one of Britain's biggest pop acts. Their debut album ''[[Fantastic (Wham! album)|Fantastic]]'' spent two weeks at No. 1 in the UK album charts in 1983, but the album achieved only modest success in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/wham!/ |title=WHAM! &#124; Artist |publisher=Official Charts |access-date=29 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Legal disputes with Innervision===\nSoon after this, Ridgeley became conscious of legal problems with their initial contract at Innervision.

These changes helped to propel Wham!'s next single, \"[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]\", into the top ten of several countries around the world. It became their first US and UK No. 1 single, accompanied by a video of the duo with Pepsi and Shirlie, all wearing [[Katharine Hamnett]] T-shirts with the slogans \"CHOOSE LIFE\" and \"GO GO\".<ref name=\"Sibbles 2009\">{{cite web | last=Sibbles | first=Emma | title=Get it off your chest: The slogan T-shirt has a noble history | website=The Guardian | date=2009-06-18 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/19/slogan-t-shirts-hamnett | access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref>\n\nThe next single from the Wham! album was \"[[Careless Whisper]]\", but it featured only George Michael in the music video. In certain markets, the single was promoted as \"Wham! featuring George Michael\", and in other markets, it was credited to only George Michael as a solo act but, unlike any Wham! single except \"Wham Rap!\" and \"Club Tropicana\", it was also co-written with Andrew Ridgeley. The song, about a remorseful two-timer, had more emotional depth than previous releases. It reached No. 1, selling over 1.3 million copies in the UK.<ref name=\"everyhit.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/bestsellingsingles.html |title=Best Selling Singles Of All Time |website=EveryHit.com |access-date=29 December 2012}}</ref> \"Careless Whisper\" marked a new phase in Michael's career, as his label Columbia/Epic began to somewhat distance him from the group Wham!'s playboy image.\n\nThe next single was \"[[Freedom (Wham! song)|Freedom]]\" and was simply promoted as a Wham! single. Wham! used a video edited together from footage of their tour in China for \"Freedom\"'s US single release. Their second album, ''[[Make It Big]]'', climbed to No. 1 on the album charts and the band set off on an arena tour at the end of 1984.<ref name=\"tours.yogsbackyard.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tours.yogsbackyard.co.uk/home.php |title=Tours Menu |publisher=Tours.yogsbackyard.co.uk |access-date=29 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912030459/http://www.tours.yogsbackyard.co.uk/home.php |archive-date=12 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe double A-side single \"[[Last Christmas]]/[[Everything She Wants]]\" became the highest-selling single ever to peak at No. 2 in the UK charts.

Nevertheless, Band Aid's success meant that Michael had achieved #1 status in the UK within three separate entities in 1984\u2014as a solo artist, as one half of a duo, and as part of a charity ensemble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pure80spop.co.uk/1984.htm |title=The complete list of the UK No.1 songs of the 80s :1984 |website=Pure80spop.co.uk |access-date=29 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1985, the US [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1985|''Billboard'' charts]] listed \"[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]\" as the number-three song and \"[[Careless Whisper]]\" as the number-one song of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobborst.com/popculture/top-100-songs-of-the-year/?year=1985 |title=Billboard Top 100 Songs of 1985 \u2013 Year End Charts |website=Bobborst.com |access-date=29 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===China (1985)===\nIn March 1985, Wham! took a break from recording to embark on a lengthy world tour, including a ground-breaking 10-day visit to China, the first by a Western pop group.<ref name=\"McCarty 2010\"/> The China excursion was a publicity scheme devised by [[Simon Napier-Bell]] (one of their two managers; [[Jazz Summers]] being the other). It began with a concert at the Peoples' Gymnasium in Beijing in front of 12,000 people. They also played a concert in front of 5,000 in Canton. The two concerts were played without compensation.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ROCK: East meets Wham!, and another great wall comes down|last=Neville|first=Sam|date=28 April 1985|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|via=ProQuest}}</ref> Wham!'s visit to China attracted huge media attention across the world. Napier-Bell later admitted that he used cunning tactics to sabotage the efforts of rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to be the first to play in China: he made two brochures for the Chinese authorities; one featuring Wham! fans as pleasant middle-class youngsters and one portraying Queen lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] in typically flamboyant poses. The Chinese opted for Wham!.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4379399.stm |title=How Wham! brought the West to China |work=BBC News |date=24 March 2005 }}</ref>\n\nBritish director [[Lindsay Anderson]] was engaged to accompany Wham! to China and make a documentary film about the visit. Anderson called his one-hour and 18 minute film ''If You Were There''.\nIn the final stages of editing, Anderson was dismissed<ref>{{cite web|url-status=dead|url=http://lindsayandersonfilms.comxa.com/wham.html|title=Wham in China \u2013 Foreign Skies (1986) AKA Lindsay Anderson's If You Were There|access-date=11 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305014018/http://lindsayandersonfilms.comxa.com/wham.html |archive-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> by Wham!'s management, the editing team quit, and the film was re-edited, renamed and released as ''[[Wham! in China: Foreign Skies]]''. According to a 2006 interview with ''The Independent'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/how-wham-made-lindsay-anderson-see-red-in-china-358347.html|title=How Wham! made Lindsay Anderson see red in China|author=Paul Kelbie, Scotland Correspondent|date=17 August 2012|work=The Independent|access-date=11 December 2015}}</ref> Andy Stephens, manager for Michael, said that the film [Anderson's version] was simply not good enough to be shown in public: \"It's a dreadful film&nbsp;... It's 20 years old and it's rubbish. Why on earth should we allow it to be shown?\", although after viewing it in 2008 critic and journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] described it as \"a rich, poetic, panoramic portrait of China's strangeness to the eyes of outsiders\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/19/drama |title=Sentenced to a lifetime of stress |last=Harris |first=John |author-link=John Harris (critic) |date=19 September 2008|website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Live Aid (1985)===\nSporting a beard, Michael appeared with Ridgeley onstage at [[Live Aid]] on 13 July 1985 (although they did not perform as Wham!). Michael sang \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" with [[Elton John]], while Ridgeley joined [[Kiki Dee]] in the row of backing singers. In September, Wham! released the single \"[[I'm Your Man (Wham! song)|I'm Your Man]]\" which went to No. 1 in the UK charts.\n\nAround this time, Ridgeley began a relationship with [[Keren Woodward]] of [[Bananarama]], and also took up the hobby of rally driving. \"[[Last Christmas]]\" was re-issued for the festive season and again made the UK Top 10, peaking at No. 6, while Michael took up offers he was starting to receive to add his voice to other artists' songs. He performed backing vocals for [[David Cassidy]], and also for Elton John on his successful singles \"[[Nikita (song)|Nikita]]\" (UK No. 3) and \"[[Wrap Her Up]]\" (UK No. 12), on which he sang co-lead vocals.\n\n===Breakup (1986)===\nMichael was keen to create music targeted at a more sophisticated adult market rather than the duo's primarily teenage audience, and therefore, he and Ridgeley officially announced the breakup of Wham! in the spring of 1986. Before going their separate ways, a farewell single \"[[The Edge of Heaven]]\", and a greatest hits album titled ''[[The Final (album)|The Final]]'' would be forthcoming, along with a farewell concert entitled ''[[The Final (concert)|The Final]]''. Announcing the breakup, Michael said: \"I think it should be the most amicable split in pop history.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.george.michael.szm.com/Esection/E1986sh.html|title=Press 1986 - Smash Hits|access-date=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe farewell single reached No. 1 in June 1986. \"[[Where Did Your Heart Go?]]\" was the group's final single in the United States. The song, originally recorded by [[Was (Not Was)]], was a gloomy and sombre affair. The duo's last release was a double-LP collection of all the singles to date, including some extended versions. This was released in North America as the severely pared-down ''[[Music from the Edge of Heaven]]'' with alternate tracks.\n\nAt London's [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 28 June 1986, Wham! bid goodbye to their fans and each other with an emotional embrace at the end of its final concert. 72,000 people attended the eight-hour event,<ref name=\"tours.yogsbackyard.co.uk\"/> which included support artists, on a scorching hot day in London. The duo had been together for five years, selling over 28 million records and 15 million singles. ''Foreign Skies'', the documentary of their tour of China, received its world premiere as part of the festivities.\n\n===Post-Wham! and Michael's death===\nFor several years after becoming a solo artist, Michael spoke negatively, in public, about his time with Wham!, partly because of the negativity of intense media coverage on Ridgeley. Michael complained of the constant pressure he felt, and he claimed that the duo had been mistreated financially. He also spoke disparagingly about some of the videos and songs from the Wham! repertoire, especially the video from \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\", and the songs from ''[[Fantastic (Wham! album)|Fantastic]]''. However, his perspective on the era softened somewhat in the later years of his life. At his solo concerts he would still perform \"I'm Your Man\" and \"Everything She Wants\", the latter being one of the more critically acclaimed songs from the Wham! era.\n\nAndrew Ridgeley moved to [[Monaco]] after Wham!'s breakup and tried his hand at [[Formula Three]] motor racing. Meeting with little success, Ridgeley moved to Los Angeles to pursue his singing/acting career, the failure of which caused him to return to England in 1990. Regardless, CBS Records, having taken up the option on Wham!'s contract that specified solo albums from Michael and Ridgeley, released a solo effort from Ridgeley, ''[[Son of Albert]]'', in 1990. After poor sales, CBS declined the option of a second album. On 25 June 1988, George Michael's 25th birthday, Michael played the third of three dates at Birmingham's [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC]] as part of the [[Faith World Tour]]. He appeared deeply moved when he was surprised on stage by many members of his family with Andrew Ridgeley, who was pushing a trolley carrying a huge birthday cake. They led the 13,000-strong crowd in a rendition of \"[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]\" before Ridgeley accompanied Michael in a performance of \"[[I'm Your Man (Wham! song)|I'm Your Man]]\".\n\nIn January 1991, Ridgeley joined Michael on stage for a few songs at the [[encore]] of his performance at the [[Rock in Rio]] event at the [[Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3|Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].<ref name=\"tours.yogsbackyard.co.uk\"/> On 21 November 2009, there was a Wham!-themed night on television's ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' in the UK. Michael later appeared on the show's final episode, performing a duet of \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" with finalist and eventual winner [[Joe McElderry]]. In 2012, Michael said that there was no truth in speculation that he and Ridgeley were set for a Wham! reunion to mark the 30th anniversary of the group's first album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2012-06-20/wham-reunion-rumoured-after-george-michael-announces-new-single/ |title=Wham! reunion rumours quashed by George Michael|publisher=[[ITV News]] |date=20 June 2012 |access-date=29 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nMichael died from heart and liver disease at his home in [[Goring-on-Thames|Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire]] on Christmas Day 2016.
