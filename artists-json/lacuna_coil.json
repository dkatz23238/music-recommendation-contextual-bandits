Since their formation in 1994, the group has had two name changes, being previously known as '''Sleep of Right''' and '''Ethereal''',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://events.pe.com/beaumont_tx/events/show/306015525-sevendust-with-lacuna-coil-and-avatar |title=Sevendust with Lacuna Coil and Avatar at Dixie Dance Hall |publisher=Events.PE}}</ref> and they have recorded nine studio albums, two extended plays, two live albums, two compilation albums, one video album, and sixteen singles and music videos.\n\nInspired by the combination of [[Gothic aesthetics|gothic]] imagery and music, the members have been known, musically, for composing mid-tempo songs consisting of prominent guitar lines and contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies to help create a melodic, detached sound. Much of the band's recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher mixing of the guitars within the songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/reviews/details.cfm?releaseid=246 |title=Lacuna Coil - \"Karmacode\" CD Review - in Metal Reviews |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=10 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/11535/tempidx/4/menuid/2 |title=Review: Lacuna Coil - Karmacode |publisher=Blistering.com |date=22 November 2007 |access-date=10 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325124723/http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/11535/tempidx/4/menuid/2 |archive-date=25 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThey have toured internationally and were nominated in 2006 for a [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Italian Act|MTV Europe Music Award]]. They won the 2012 [[Metal Female Voices Fest]] Award for the Best Album, the 2016 Metal Hammer Award for the Best International Band, and the 2018 [[Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards|Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award]] for Best Live Act. The band's 2012 release, ''[[Dark Adrenaline]]'', peaked at number 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

After recording a song titled \"Bleeding Souls\" for the ''Noise of Bolgia'' compilation in 1995, Claudio Leo became the band's second guitarist, and Leonardo Forti replaced Michaelangelo on the drums after his departure. The band asked [[Cristina Scabbia]], a friend and girlfriend of Marco at the time, to sing background vocals briefly, which led to her officially joining the band. Soon after, the band changed their name to '''Ethereal''', and signed to [[Century Media Records|Century Media]] at the end of 1997. Finding that the name Ethereal was already taken by a Greek band, they changed their name to Lacuna Coil, meaning \"empty spiral\".<ref name=spyral>{{cite web|url=http://www.emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=95 |title=Emptyspiral.net - The Lacuna Coil Community |access-date=14 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122948/http://www.emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=95 |archive-date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nLacuna Coil released a self-titled [[extended play|EP]] through Century Media in 1998, shortly after Raffael Zagaria, Claudio Leo, and Leonardo Forti departed. As a result, guitarist Cristiano Migliore and drummer Cristiano Mozzati were recruited officially. At this point, the band was touring with [[Moonspell]] after the release of the [[Lacuna Coil (EP)|''Lacuna Coil EP'']].\n\n===''In a Reverie'' (1998\u20132000)===\nFollowing a second European tour, the band recorded their debut full-length album ''[[In a Reverie]]'' and added second guitarist Marco Biazzi. The band supported the album with another European tour, co-headlining with [[Skyclad (band)|Skyclad]]. [[Allmusic]] rated the album 4 stars, saying it was \"a fine debut by a band that bears watching.\" The band toured mostly around Europe, generally as a support act.\n\n===''Halflife'' EP and ''Unleashed Memories'' (2000\u20132002)===\nFollowing their debut, ''In a Reverie'', the EP ''[[Halflife (EP)|Half-Life]]'' was released in 2000 with five songs: \"Half Life\", \"Hyperfast\", \"Stars\" (a cover of a [[Dubstar]] single), \"Trance Awake\" and a demo version of \"Senzafine\". The final version of the latter was included in the 2001 album ''[[Unleashed Memories]]''. While the studio album contained 10 songs, later re-releases included the ''Halflife'' EP. That same year, the band toured the United States for the first time, supporting [[Moonspell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/moonspell-frontman-comments-on-nocturnal-mourning-tour/|title=MOONSPELL Frontman Comments On 'Nocturnal Mourning' Tour|date=19 June 2006|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emptyspiral.net/features/lacuna-coil-biography/|title=Lacuna Coil Biography|date=23 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Comalies'' (2002\u20132005)===\n[[Image:Lacuna Coil Mera luna 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Cristina Scabbia]] (left) and [[Andrea Ferro]] performing at the 2005 [[M'era Luna Festival]]]]\nThe band's breakthrough album ''[[Comalies]]'' was released in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Hinds |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/comalies-mw0000226154 |title=Comalies - Lacuna Coil &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=29 October 2002 |access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref> A significant player on Europe's metal scene for nearly a decade at this point, the band was virtually unknown in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/39395 |title=Music - Lacuna Coil \u2013 Karmacode Review |publisher=411mania.com |date=4 April 2006 |access-date=10 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729084003/http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/39395 |archive-date=29 July 2009 }}</ref> The TV series ''[[Uranium (TV series)|Uranium]]'' gave the band some of its earliest US exposure; over a year later, the first single from ''Comalies'', \"[[Heaven's a Lie]]\", began to receive radio and media attention, pulling the band into North America's musical mainstream.
