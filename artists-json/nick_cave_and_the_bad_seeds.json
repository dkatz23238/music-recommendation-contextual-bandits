The band has featured international personnel throughout its career and presently consists of Cave, violinist and multi-instrumentalist [[Warren Ellis (musician)|Warren Ellis]], bassist [[Martyn P. Casey]] (all from Australia), guitarist [[George Vjestica]] (United Kingdom), keyboardist/percussionist Toby Dammit (United States) and drummers [[Thomas Wydler]] (Switzerland) and [[Jim Sclavunos]] (United States). Described as \"one of the most original and celebrated bands of the [[post-punk]] and [[alternative rock]] eras in the '80s and onward\",<ref name=\"AMbio\" /> they have released seventeen studio albums and completed numerous international tours.\n\nThe band was founded following the demise of Cave and Harvey's former group [[The Birthday Party (band)|the Birthday Party]], the members of which met at a boarding school in [[Melbourne]].<ref name=\"Simon\" /> Throughout the 1980s, beginning with their debut LP ''[[From Her to Eternity]]'' (1984), the band drew largely on post-punk, [[blues]] and [[gothic rock]], and brought in musicians such as [[Blixa Bargeld]], [[Barry Adamson]] and [[Kid Congo Powers]]. The band later softened their sound and incorporated other influences on albums such as ''[[The Good Son (album)|The Good Son]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Boatman's Call]]'' (1997). Following Harvey's departure in 2009,<ref name=\"Mick\" /> the band broadened their sound further to include electronic and ambient styles, which feature prominently on the trilogy of albums ''[[Push the Sky Away]]'' (2013), ''[[Skeleton Tree]]'' (2016) and ''[[Ghosteen]]'' (2019).\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early releases (1983\u20131985)===\nThe project that later evolved into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds began following the demise of [[the Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]] in August 1983. Both Cave and Harvey were members of the Birthday Party, along with guitarist [[Rowland S. Howard]] and bassist [[Tracy Pew]]. During the recording sessions of the Birthday Party's scheduled EPs ''[[Mutiny/The Bad Seed]]'', internal disputes developed in the band. The difference in Cave and Howard's approach to songwriting was a major factor, as Cave explained in an interview with ''On The Street'': \"the main reason why The Birthday Party broke up was that the sort of songs that I was writing and the sort of songs that Rowland was writing were just totally at odds with each other.\" Following the departure of Harvey, they officially disbanded. Cave also said that \"it probably would have gone on longer, but Mick has the ability to judge things much more clearly than the rest of us.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cave|first1=Nick|last2=Miller|first2=Rob|year=1984|title=''In a Black Box with Nick Cave''|journal=On the Street|issue=May 1984|url=http://www.bad-seed.org/~cave/interviews/83-05_ots.html|access-date=14 February 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Nick Cave 1986.jpg|thumb|150px|Cave and guitarist [[Kid Congo Powers]] during the band's 1986 tour.]]\n\nAn embryonic version of what became Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds was formed in the Birthday Party's then-home of London in September 1983, with Cave, Harvey (acting primarily as drummer), [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] guitarist Blixa Bargeld, [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]] bassist [[Barry Adamson]], and [[Jim G. Thirlwell]]. The band was initially formed as a backing band for Cave's intended solo project ''Man or Myth?'', which had been approved by the record label [[Mute Records]]. During September and October 1983, they recorded material with producer [[Flood (producer)|Flood]],<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=''From Her to Eternity''|title-link=From Her to Eternity|others=Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds|year=1984|type=CD|publisher=Mute Records|id=5099923724228}}</ref> although the sessions were cut short due to Cave's touring with [[the Immaculate Consumptive]], another project formed with Thirlwell, [[Lydia Lunch]] and [[Marc Almond]].<ref>{{cite book|title=''Alternative Rock: Third Ear - The Essential Listening Companion''|last=Thompson|first=Dave|author-link=Dave Thompson (author)|year=2000 |publisher=Miller Freeman|isbn=0-87930-607-6|page=425}}</ref> In December 1983 Cave returned to [[Melbourne, Australia]], where he formed a temporary line-up of his backing band, due to Bargeld's absence, that included Pew and guitarist [[Hugo Race]]. The band performed their first live show at Seaview in [[St. Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]] on 31 December 1983.<ref name=\"fta\">{{cite web|title=From The Archives - Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds- Concert Chronology / Gigography|url=http://www.fromthearchives.com/nc/chronology.html|work=From the Archives|access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a short Australian tour, and during a period when they were without management, Cave and his band returned to London. Cave, Harvey, Bargeld, Race and Adamson formed the project's first consistent line-up, while Cave's longtime girlfriend [[Anita Lane]] was credited as a lyricist on occasional songs (e.g., the title track of 1984's ''[[From Her to Eternity]]''). The group, which up to this time had been nameless, adopted the moniker Nick Cave and the Cavemen, which they used for the first six months of their career. However, they were later renamed Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in May 1984, in reference to the final Birthday Party EP ''The Bad Seed''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} They began recording sessions for their debut album in March 1984 at London's [[Trident Studios]] and these sessions, together with the abandoned ''Man or Myth?'' sessions from September\u2013October 1983 that were recorded at The Garden studios, formed the album ''From Her to Eternity'', released on Mute Records in 1984. Thirlwell left during the recording sessions for ''Eternity'', citing creative disagreements and desires to work on his own solo material.<ref name=Wray2014>Daniel Dylan Wray (2014) [http://thequietus.com/articles/16018-the-birthday-party-interview-nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds If This Is Heaven I'm Bailing Out: The Death Of The Birthday Party ], The Quietus, accessed 5 Jan 2017</ref> Race, and touring guitarist Edward Clayton-Jones, left to form [[the Wreckery]] in Melbourne.<ref name=\"McFarlane tW\">{{cite book | last1 = McFarlane | first1 = Ian | author-link1 = Ian McFarlane | title = [[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]] | chapter = Encyclopedia entry for 'The Wreckery' | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040803170443/http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=793 | chapter-url = http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=793 | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]] | location = [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]] | archive-date = 3 August 2004 | isbn = 1-86508-072-1 }}</ref>\n\n===Move to Germany and stylistic evolution (1985\u20131989)===\nAfter the departure of Race and Lane, the remaining members moved to West Berlin, Germany in 1985 and released a second album ''[[The Firstborn Is Dead]]''. The album was heavily influenced by the gothic [[Americana (music)|Americana]] of the [[American South]] and [[blues music]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r3471|title=''The Firstborn is Dead'' - Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds|website=[[AllMusic]]|date=6 January 2012}}</ref> exemplified in songs such as \"[[Tupelo (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds song)|Tupelo]]\" and \"Blind Lemon Jefferson\", which reference the birth of [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] respectively. Released the following year, the album ''[[Kicking Against the Pricks]]'' explored such influences with renditions of material by [[Johnny Cash]], [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[Lead Belly]]. The 1986 album also marked the arrival of Swiss drummer [[Thomas Wydler]], a member of [[Die Haut]], and featured guest appearances from Race, Pew, and Birthday Party guitarist Howard, who had briefly toured with the Bad Seeds as a substitute member in 1985.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Pew's death from an epileptic seizure also occurred in 1986.<ref name=\"Simon\" />\n\nThe band garnered an increased following due to a second 1986 album release, ''[[Your Funeral, My Trial]]'', which coincided with Adamson's departure.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} ''[[Tender Prey]]'', the dark, brooding<ref name=gs>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/15279/reviews/4139649|title=Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds - ''The Good Son'' review|publisher=Drowned in Sound|date=6 January 2012|access-date=7 January 2012|archive-date=31 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331201116/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/15279/reviews/4139649|url-status=dead}}</ref> 1988 follow-up, saw the arrival of American guitarist and [[The Gun Club]] stalwart [[Kid Congo Powers]]\u2014Harvey made the transition to bass\u2014and short-tenured German keyboardist [[Roland Wolf (musician)|Roland Wolf]].

The addition of Casey on bass allowed Harvey to return to guitar. Their next record, 1992's ''[[Henry's Dream]]'', marked a change towards a harder rock sound.

The Minogue collaboration was a mainstream hit in the UK and Australia, and won three [[ARIA Awards|Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Awards]], including Song of the Year. It was at this time that Ellis of the [[Dirty Three]] began regularly working with the band and eventually became Cave's primary collaborator.<ref name=\"Simon\" />\n\nThe sound of ''[[The Boatman's Call]]'', released in 1997, was a radical departure from the archetypal and violent narratives of the band's past, featuring songs about relationships, loss, and longing, often with sparse arrangements. Cave revealed his mindset during the creation of the album in a 2008 interview: \"When I was making half that record I was furious because certain things had happened in my love life that seriously pissed me off. And some of those songs came straight out of that. I don't regret making it ... the songs are of a moment when you felt a certain way. When ... you just think, 'Fuck - please!'\"<ref name=\"Simon\" /> The album's corresponding tour was later documented on the 2008 live album ''[[Live at the Royal Albert Hall (Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds album)|Live at the Royal Albert Hall]]''.

The proper follow-up to ''The Boatman's Call'' was 2001's ''[[No More Shall We Part]]''. The record featured guest appearances by [[Kate & Anna McGarrigle]] and was generally well received in reviews: one critic hailed the album as an \"entire album of deeply tragic and beautiful love songs without irony, sarcasm, or violent resolution\", while also stating that the work is at risk of devolving \"into schmaltz\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/no-more-shall-we-part-r525864/review|title=''No More Shall We Part'' - Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds|publisher=All Music|date=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe band then released ''[[Nocturama (album)|Nocturama]]'' in 2003. The album marked a return to band-oriented and collaborative arrangements, as previous releases involved a decreased level of input from Cave's bandmates.
