With her distinctive [[mezzo-soprano]] sound, she was a significant singer of [[blue-eyed soul]], [[Pop music|pop]] and dramatic [[Ballad|ballads]], with [[chanson|French chanson]], [[Country music|country]], and [[Jazz music|jazz]] also in her repertoire. During her 1960s peak, she ranked among the most successful British female performers on both sides of the Atlantic. Her image \u2013 marked by a [[peroxide blonde]] [[bouffant]]/[[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] hairstyle, heavy makeup (thick black eyeliner and [[eye shadow]]) and  [[evening gown]]s, as well as stylised, gestural performances \u2013 made her an icon of the [[Swinging Sixties]].<ref name=queen />\n\nBorn in [[West Hampstead]] in London into a family that enjoyed music, Springfield learned to sing at home. In 1958, she joined her first professional group, [[The Lana Sisters]]. Two years later, with her brother [[Tom Springfield]] and [[Reshad Feild|Tim Feild]], Springfield formed the folk-pop vocal trio [[The Springfields]]. Two of their five 1961\u201363 Top 40 UK hits \u2013 \"[[Island of Dreams (song)|Island of Dreams]]\" and \"Say I Won't Be There\" \u2013 reached no. 5 in the charts, both in the spring of 1963. In 1962 they also hit big in the States with their cover of \"[[Silver Threads and Golden Needles]]\".\n\nSpringfield's solo career began in late 1963 with the upbeat pop record \"[[I Only Want to Be with You]]\" \u2014 a  UK no. 4 hit, and the first of her six transatlantic Top 40 hits in the 1960s, along with \u201cStay Awhile\u201d (1964), \"All I See Is You\" (1966), \"[[I'll Try Anything]]\" (1967) and the two releases now considered her signature songs: \"[[You Don't Have to Say You Love Me]]\" (1966 UK no. 1/US no. 4) and \"[[Son of a Preacher Man]]\" (1968/69 UK no. 9/US no. 10). The latter features on the 1968 pop and [[soul music|soul]] album ''[[Dusty in Memphis]]'', one of Springfield's defining works. In March 2020, the US [[Library of Congress]] added it to the [[National Recording Registry]], which preserves audio recordings considered to be \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\nBetween 1964 and 1969 Springfield hit big in her native Britain with several singles which in America either failed to chart or were not released, among them \"[[I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself]]\" (the biggest of her many [[Burt Bacharach|Bacharach]]/[[Hal David|David]] covers), \"In the Middle of Nowhere\", \"Some of Your Lovin'\", \"[[Goin' Back]]\" and [[I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten (song)|\"I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten]]\". Conversely, she charted in the US (but not in the UK) with hits including \"[[Wishin' and Hopin']]&thinsp;\", \"[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\" and \"[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]\".\n\nFrom 1971 to 1986 Springfield failed to register a hit from five album releases (aside from a minor 1979 UK chart appearance), but her 1987 collaboration with UK [[synthpop]] duo [[Pet Shop Boys]], \"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This? (song)|What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\", took her back to the top of the charts, reaching no. 2 on both the [[UK Singles Chart|UK singles chart]] and [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. The collaboration also yielded two 1989 UK Top 20 hits: \"[[Nothing Has Been Proved]]\" and \"[[In Private]]\". In 1990, Springfield charted with \u201cReputation\u201d \u2013 the last of 25 Top 40 UK hits in which she features.\n\nA fixture on British television, Springfield presented many episodes of the hip 1963\u201366 British TV music series ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' and, between 1966 and 69, hosted her own series on the [[BBC TV|BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. In 1966, Springfield topped the popularity polls, including ''[[Melody Maker]]''{{'}}s Best International Vocalist,<ref>{{cite web |title=Dusty Springfield obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/mar/04/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=4 March 1999 |access-date=10 May 2020}}</ref> and was the first UK singer to top the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' readers' poll for Female Singer.
