It contains elements of [[minimalistic music|minimalistic]] style, [[contemporary classical music|contemporary]] [[European classical music|classical]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[electronic music|electronic]] [[music loop|loops]]. In their performances each member will play many instruments, sometimes moving across the stage, going from one instrument to another mid-song.\n\n==History==\nThe founding members Maria Huld Markan Sigf\u00fasd\u00f3ttir (born September 29, 1980), S\u00f3lr\u00fan Sumarli\u00f0ad\u00f3ttir (born August 10, 1977), Hildur \u00c1rs\u00e6lsd\u00f3ttir (born January 31, 1980) and Edda R\u00fan \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir (born February 3, 1978) performed as a quartet playing classical music when they were studying string instruments at the Reykjav\u00edk College of Music in the late 1990s. Mar\u00eda and Hildur as violinists, Edda as violist, and S\u00f3lr\u00fan as cellist. Later on they adopted the name amiina and increasingly moved on to play all sorts of music with various bands in Reykjav\u00edk.\n\nIn 1999 the quartet joined Icelandic band [[Sigur R\u00f3s]] on-stage. The collaboration has continued ever since, with amiina contributing strings to Sigur R\u00f3s' music on tour and in the recording studio notably on the award-winning album ''[[( ) (album)|( )]]'' as well as its follow-up, ''[[Takk...]]''.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/disco/parenth.php |title=sigur r\u00f3s - discography \u00bb ( ) |access-date=2009-03-08 |work=sigur-ros.co.uk| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090305132033/http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/disco/parenth.php| archive-date= 5 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/disco/takk-credits.php |title=sigur r\u00f3s - discography \u00bb takk... |access-date=2009-03-08 |work=sigur-ros.co.uk| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090305130521/http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/disco/takk-credits.php| archive-date= 5 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> and ''[[Me\u00f0 su\u00f0 \u00ed eyrum vi\u00f0 spilum endalaust]]''. amiina recorded strings for the Sigur R\u00f3s album ''[[Valtari]]'' but no longer accompany Sigur R\u00f3s on tour.\n\nTheir first commercially available recording was the four-[[song|track]] [[extended play|EP]] ''[[animamina]]''. This was followed by their first [[single (music)|single]], ''[[Seoul (song)|Seoul]]''. Their first full-length [[album]], ''[[Kurr]]'', was released March 21, 2007, through the band's own label, Bl\u00e1skj\u00e1r. It was re-released by [[Ever Records]] in June 2007.\n\namiina's first solo tours of Europe and America were in October and November 2006. Following the release of ''[[Kurr]]'' in 2007 they toured North America in March and April and Europe in May. The song \"[[Hilli (At The Top Of The World)|Hilli]]\" was released on December 10, 2007, as the second single from the album ''Kurr''. It is a collaboration between amiina and [[Lee Hazlewood]] whose vocals (the last recording before his death) were mixed with a reworked version of the original song.\n\namiina appeared in the 2008 Icelandic movie ''[[White Night Wedding|Br\u00fa\u00f0guminn]]'' (''White Night Wedding'').\n\nIn the autumn of 2007, drummer Magn\u00fas Trygvason Eliassen (born November 18, 1985) joined amiina on tour, \nadding percussion to the band's textures. A few months later, collaboration between amiina and the electronic artist Gu\u00f0mundur Vignir Karlsson (born November 10, 1978) under the moniker Kippi Kaninus was initiated while preparing a show for the [[Reykjav\u00edk Arts Festival]]. The merging of Kippi Kaninus' electronics and rhythms with amiina's sounds and Magn\u00fas' percussion became the starting point for more established collaboration between the six musicians. During 2009 Magn\u00fas and Gu\u00f0mundur joined the group on a permanent basis.\n\nThe recording of amiina's second studio album ''[[Puzzle (Amiina album)|Puzzle]]'' started during spring or summer of 2010,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistadvocacy.com/music/features/amiina-interview/ |title=Amiina Interview |author=Shaun Oppedisano |access-date=2010-01-05 |work= Artist Advocacy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://icelandmusic.is/In-the-spotlight/1027/Amiina---A-Noble-Quartet/default.aspx |title=Amiina - A Noble Quartet |access-date=2010-01-05 |work=Iceland Music Export |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901222310/http://www.icelandmusic.is/In-the-spotlight/1027/Amiina---A-Noble-Quartet/default.aspx |archive-date=2009-09-01 }}</ref> released by the band on September 27, 2010, getting worldwide distribution the following year. The songs on ''Puzzle'' are more rhythmically rugged than previous work and feature heavier use of electronics. amiina's long-standing fondness for light melodies and open-minded instrumentation, however, continued.\n\nIn 2009 amiina started to perform their original soundtracks to pioneering German filmmaker Lotte Reiniger's 1930s silhouette animations of the timeless fairy tales Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella and Aladdin. The so-called ''Animagica'' program, originally performed at the [[Branchage]] Film Festival in Jersey, has now been performed at Latitude, Sydney Festival, Mona Foma in Tasmania, St. Leonard's Church London, Perth International Art Festival, National Museum of Singapore and Reykjavik's Children Festival. When performing the ''Animagica'' program amiina plays usually as a trio or a quartet.\n\nIn late 2012 amiina recorded ''The Lighthouse Project''. It was a work which the band started in 2009 and was released as an EP in June 2013, distributed by [[Morr Music]]. These songs were recorded in their original arrangements for a quartet. Because the group felt it important to convey the intimacy of the original performances it was recorded \"live\" in the studio by [[Ben Frost (musician)|Ben Frost]].\n\nIn between work with amiina the band members have kept themselves busy, recording or touring with other artists such as: Sigur R\u00f3s, [[Yann Tiersen]], [[Spiritualized]], [[Efterklang]], [[Yukihiro Takahasi]], [[Canon Blue]], [[P\u00e9tur Ben]], Ben Frost, [[Tilbury]], [[Borko]], [[m\u00fam]], [[J\u00f3nsi & Alex]], Kippi Kaninus, [[adhd]], [[Moses Hightower]], [[Sin Fang]], and [[Zoon van snooK]].\n\nDuring 2015 Hildur \u00c1rs\u00e6lsd\u00f3ttir and Edda R\u00fan \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir left the band. On November 25, 2016, amiina returned as a four-member band releasing their album ''Fant\u00f4mas''. Their upcoming album ''Pharology'' is planned for June 25, 2021 and is expected as a digital and vinyl release.\n\n==Instruments==\n;[[Electronic musical instrument|Electronic]]\n:*Compact [[synthesizer]]\n:*[[Digital piano]]\n:*[[Theremin]]\n;[[Guitar]]s\n:*[[Baroque guitar|Baroque]]\n:*Solid-body [[electric guitar|electric]]\n;[[Harp]]s\n:*[[Celtic harp|Celtic]]\n;[[Reed (instrument)|Reeds]]\n:*[[Pump organ|Harmonium]]\n:*[[Melodica]]\n;Metallophones\n:*[[Celesta]]\n:*[[Glockenspiel]] (which they sometimes [[bow (music)|bow]])\n;Viols\n:*Cello\n:*Viola\n:*Violin\n;[[Zither]]s\n:*[[Gideon harp]] ([http://www.fretlesszithers.com/znochords.html#gid external description]; also called a \"table harp\")\n;Other\n:*[[Call bell]]s (also called \"office\" or \"reception\" bells)\n:*[[Glass harp]]\n:*[[Kalimba]]\n:*[[Mandolin]]\n:*[[Musical saw]]\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n*''[[Kurr]]'' (March 21, 2007)\n*''[[Puzzle (Amiina album)|Puzzle]]'' (September, 2010)\n*''[[Fant\u00f4mas (Amiina album)|Fant\u00f4mas]]'' (November 25, 2016)\n\n===EPs===\n*''[[AnimaminA]]'' (May 9, 2005)\n*''[[Re Minore]]'' (2009)\n*''[[The Lighthouse Project (EP)|The Lighthouse Project]]'' (June 7, 2013)\n\n===Singles===\n*\"[[Seoul (song)|Seoul]]\" (November 6, 2006)\n*\"[[Hilli (At The Top Of The World)]]\" (December 17, 2007) [7\" limited edition]\n*\"[[Over & Again]]\" (2010) [Limited to 500 copies]\n*\"What are we waiting for?\" (September 2010)\n\n===Compilation inclusions===\n*''[[Screaming Masterpiece]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Kitchen Motors Family Album/Fj\u00f6lskyldualb\u00fam Tilraunaeldh\u00fassins]]'' (Spring 2006)\n*''[[Nightmare Revisited]]'' (\"Doctor Finkelstein/In the Forest\") (2008)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:ELMINOFFICIAL]], choose one official website only -->\n* {{official website|http://www.amiina.com/}}\n* [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16524673 Amiina at NPR Music]\n* [http://theindiemusicdb.com/artist/?artist=79 Amiina entry at The Indie Music Database]\n* [http://www.thegmanworld.com/2011/10/g-man-interview-w-amiina.html 2011 interview with Amiina]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amiina}}\n[[Category:Sigur R\u00f3s]]\n[[Category:Icelandic post-rock groups]]\n[[Category:All-female bands]]\n[[Category:String quartets]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Reykjav\u00edk]]", "sha1": "2pa3uyc1j3dkciau1pblxehhn9oq0kf"}
