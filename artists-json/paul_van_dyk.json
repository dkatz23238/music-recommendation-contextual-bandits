With its release, the series, which began in 2001, moved from that of music compilation to artist album. On it, van Dyk worked with artists including [[Aly & Fila]], [[Giuseppe Ottaviani]] and others.\n\nOn 28 February 2016 during the ''[[A State of Trance]]'' Festival in [[Utrecht]], van Dyk fell through a concealed gap in the stage during his performance, and was transported to a local hospital. Due to a spinal injury and severe brain injury, van Dyk remained under doctors' supervision at Utrecht Medical Center for weeks. He was cleared for professional medical transfer to a facility in Berlin until mid-May 2016. Numerous performances suffered forced cancellations during this time, including the [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixmag.net/read/paul-van-dyk-suffered-a-fall-during-asot-utrecht-news |title=Breaking: Paul Van Dyk Suffered a Fall during ASOT Utrecht and is Now Hospitalized |website=Mixmag.net |date=28 February 2016 |access-date=28 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"billboard-vandykfall\">{{cite magazine|title=Paul van Dyk Hospitalized Following Fall From ASOT Festival Stage|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/6890528/paul-van-dyk-hospitalized-following-fall-from-asot-festival-stage|magazine=Billboard|date=29 February 2016|access-date=1 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Paul van Dyk stabiel, hij heeft geluk gehad|url=http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/paul-van-dyk-stabiel-hij-heeft-geluk-gehad|website=RTL Nieuws|access-date=1 March 2016|language=nl|date=28 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713203628/https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/paul-van-dyk-stabiel-hij-heeft-geluk-gehad|archive-date=13 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Berliner DJ Paul van Dyk: Notarzt!

Having continued to convalesce, van Dyk was able to complete the album in the early summer of 2017. ''[[From Then On]]'' was released on 20 October of the same year through his own [[Vandit]] label.

His creation of ''[[The Politics of Dancing (Paul van Dyk album)|The Politics of Dancing]]'' compilation was inspired by electronic dance music's universal acclaim by different people around the world. \"Palestinians are dancing with Israelis.
