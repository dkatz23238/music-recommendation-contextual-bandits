Freezepop songs continue to appear in certain Harmonix titles. Former member Kasson Crooker currently works as a senior producer at Harmonix.\n\nThe group is popular with college students in Boston and has become part of the US [[synthpop]] scene.<ref name=\"allmusicbio\"/>\n\n==Background==\nOriginally, their music was entirely composed on a small portable [[music sequencer|MIDI sequencer]], a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] QY70, which has often been mistaken for a [[Game Boy]]. On more recent albums, they have expanded their toolkit due to a lack of variety in the sounds the QY70 provided, but it still remains an important part of the composing process. The release of ''[[Future Future Future Perfect]]'' only features the QY70 in a single song, that being \"Pop Music Is Not a Crime\".\n[[File:Freezepop.jpg|thumb|275px|Freezepop performing at the [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] River Festival on June 18, 2005|left]]\n\nIn addition to Freezepop, Kasson, who had previously been in fellow [[Boston]] band [[Splashdown (band)|Splashdown]], still records as a solo artist Symbion Project. Drinkwater is also a member of the bands Lifestyle and Karacter, and worked with the band Polystar on their debut album. Enthusiasm appears on the song \"Boom Box Chic\" by [[Los Angeles]]-based LeMans Electro.\n\nIn addition to dozens of remixes released over the years, Freezepop released a remix of their song \"Shark Attack\" done by [[chiptune]] band [[8 Bit Weapon]] in October 2007. The remix was done with a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and a [[Commodore 64]] computer. \nA recurring theme in Freezepop's music is references to science, technology, and mathematics. As examples, the \"hi-phive\" mix of \"Science Genius Girl\" features Enthusiasm reciting the first thirty digits of [[golden ratio|Phi]]. Additionally, the \"Robotron 2002\" \"All Your Base Are Belong to Us\" remix by DJ Nebula pays homage to the Internet meme [[All your base are belong to us]].\n\nFreezepop was arrested in Canada in November 2006 for trying to enter the country under [[false pretenses]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freezepop.net/oldsite/pix/110906.html |title=Thursday, November 9 |publisher=freezepop.net |date=November 9, 2006 |access-date=December 20, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726201557/https://www.freezepop.net/oldsite/pix/110906.html |archive-date=2018-07-26}}</ref> Harmonix pokes fun at them for this in the loading screens for their songs, in ''[[Rock Band]]'' and ''[[Rock Band 2]]''.\n\nOn June 4, 2009, it was announced on Freezepop's official website that founding member the Duke of [[Pannekoek]]en (originally the Duke of Candied Apples, as well as the Duke of Belgian Waffles, all three [[pseudonym]]s of Crooker) would be leaving the band.
