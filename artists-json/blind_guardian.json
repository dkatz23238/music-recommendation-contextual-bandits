The band was formed in 1984 as '''Lucifer's Heritage''' by K\u00fcrsch (then also bassist), Olbrich, other guitarist Markus D\u00f6rk and drummer [[Thomas Stauch]]. D\u00f6rk and Stauch both left the following year, and were replaced by Christof Thei\u00dfen and Hans-Peter Frey respectively, who left as well before the end of the year. In 1987, Siepen joined and Stauch returned; under this line-up, which lasted 18 years (the longest in the band's history), the band changed their name to Blind Guardian and released their first album, ''[[Battalions of Fear]]'', in 1988. They have since released ten more studio albums, including an [[Legacy of the Dark Lands|orchestral album]] that was released under the name Blind Guardian Twilight Orchestra.\n\nOver the releases, Blind Guardian established themselves as a notable successful band and as pioneers of the power metal movement. In 1996, K\u00fcrsch stopped acting as the band's bassist to focus on vocals. Various session members replaced him, mainly [[Oliver Holzwarth]]. However, in 2005, Stauch left the band, disapproving of Blind Guardian's transition into a more complex [[Progressive metal|progressive]] sound with a heavy use of backing vocals, and was replaced by Ehmke.\n\nMost of Blind Guardian's albums were well received by fans and critics alike: ''[[Somewhere Far Beyond]]'' (1992), ''[[Imaginations from the Other Side]]'' (1995), and ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'' (1998), are especially seen as influential works. The music is mostly composed by K\u00fcrsch and Olbrich together, and the lyrics, written by K\u00fcrsch, are mostly inspired by the fiction of fantasy authors such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Stephen King]], [[George R. R. Martin]] and [[Robert Jordan]], as well as traditional [[legend]]s and [[Epic poetry|epic]]s.<ref name=\"Middle-earth\">Bradford Lee Eden. Middle-earth Minstrel: Essays on Music in Tolkien.

Blind Guardian has been referred to as one of power metal \"big four\" bands, along with [[Helloween]], [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]] and [[DragonForce]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Blum|first=Jordan|title=The 'Big 4' Bands of 17 Metal Subgenres|url=https://loudwire.com/big-4-bands-metal-subgenres/|access-date=2021-12-17|website=Loudwire|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Blindguardian-logo.svg|thumb|The group's logo]]\n\n===Formation as Lucifer's Heritage (1984\u20131987)===\nBlind Guardian was formed in 1984 in [[Krefeld]], [[West Germany]], by [[Hansi K\u00fcrsch]] (vocals, bass) and [[Andre Olbrich]] (guitar) under the name Lucifer's Heritage, with Markus D\u00f6rk (guitar) and [[Thomen Stauch]] (drums). The band briefly expanded into a [[quintet]] with the addition of a second lead vocalist, Thomas Kelleners.

Finally, in 1987, Marcus Siepen joined and Thomen came back to form the lineup which would stay consistent for the next 18 years.\n\n===Name change and rise to success (1988\u20131996)===\nAfter Lucifer's Heritage signed a contract with [[No Remorse Records]], the band changed their name to Blind Guardian to avoid any speculations about [[Satanism]] (in a bio it was stated that they also wanted to distance themselves from the [[black metal]] movement, as their demos were placed in with black metal albums at local record shops). The band's new name was inspired by the [[Fates Warning]] album ''[[Awaken the Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Band|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/band/|publisher= Blind-guardian.com|access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref> They released their debut album ''[[Battalions of Fear]]'' in 1988, which was essentially a [[speed metal]] album heavily influenced by [[Helloween]].<ref name=\"Metalstorm Review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/review.php?review_id=3736&page=&message_id=|title=Battalions of Fear Review|publisher=Metalstorm.ee|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref> These two German bands had close ties, and Helloween founder [[Kai Hansen]] made a guest appearance on Blind Guardian's second LP, ''[[Follow the Blind]]'' (1989), where the band revealed some [[thrash metal]] influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalkings.ru/reviews/blind-guardian/blind-guardian.htm |title=Metalkings.com |publisher=Metalkings.ru |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Soundofmetal Review\">{{cite web|url=http://soundofmetal.se/index.php?page=blindguardianfollowtheblindreview|title=Follow the Blind Review|publisher=Soundofmetal.se|access-date=17 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308071640/http://soundofmetal.se/index.php?page=blindguardianfollowtheblindreview|archive-date=8 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their third LP, ''[[Tales from the Twilight World]]'' (1990), had a much more melodic and \"epic\" feeling, with usage of [[choir]] and classical music influence.\n\nBlind Guardian signed with [[Virgin Records]] in 1991, and released their fourth studio album ''[[Somewhere Far Beyond]]'' in 1992 and the live album ''[[Tokyo Tales]]'' in 1993.

Since ''Nightfall'', bass has been played by sessional member [[Oliver Holzwarth]], and Hansi has been able to devote all his attention to singing. ''Nightfall'' was also the last Blind Guardian album produced by Rasmussen.\n\n''[[A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)|A Night at the Opera]]'', named after [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|the Queen album]], was released four years later.

It was followed by a live album in 2003 and a DVD, ''[[Imaginations Through the Looking Glass]]'', in 2004, which was the last recorded Blind Guardian material to feature [[Thomen Stauch]] on drums. He left the band due to musical differences and was replaced by Frederik Ehmke. The first album with Ehmke was ''[[A Twist in the Myth]]'', which came out in 2006.\n\nBlind Guardian participated in the soundtrack for the ''[[In the Name of the King: a Dungeon Siege Tale]]'' [[fantasy movie]] ([[Uwe Boll]]), which came out in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imhotep.no/?did=9074224&aid=9069487 |title=Various Artists \u2013 In the Name of the King.

Beginning with their third album ''[[Tales from the Twilight World]]'', Blind Guardian gradually began to write more complicated compositions focusing less on speed. As of their sixth album, ''[[Nightfall in Middle Earth]]'', Hansi stopped playing bass to focus on singing. At this point the band began to incorporate large amounts of orchestral arrangements, and utilized the technique of [[overdub]]bing, heavily influenced by the English rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name=\"Queen influence\">{{Cite journal|title=Queen influence |publisher=Blind Guardian official site |url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/new_version/band_members.php3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626035249/http://www.blind-guardian.com/new_version/band_members.php3 |archive-date=26 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nBlind Guardian's music features the [[staccato]] guitars and double [[bass drum]]ming characteristic of power metal, as well as the use of [[overdub]]s and numerous backing vocals to create a dense sound. This proved significant on all albums after the first two but most particularly on ''[[A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.\n\nAnother definitive feature of Blind Guardian music is frequent use of [[folk music|folk tunes]] and instruments, especially in [[power ballad]]s such as \"Lord of the Rings\", \"The Bard's Song\", \"A Past and Future Secret\", \"Skalds and Shadows\" and \"Curse My Name\", among others.\n\n===Influences===\nThe band was initially inspired by their countrymen [[Helloween]], and in its early releases also showed some influence from [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Metallica]].<ref name=\"Markus interview\">{{Cite journal|title=Markus Siepen Interview |publisher= Metalkings.com|url=http://metalkings.com/reviews/blind-guardian/blind-guardian.htm|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> According to guitarist Marcus Siepen, during the songwriting for ''[[Follow the Blind]]'', they also used to listen to [[Bay Area thrash metal]] bands, such as [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]], resulting in a somewhat heavier sound.<ref name=\"Markus interview\"/>\n\nStarting with their third album, ''[[Tales from the Twilight World]]'', through ''[[Somewhere Far Beyond]]'' and ''[[Imaginations from the Other Side]]'', Blind Guardian gradually incorporated more influences from progressive and classical music. [[Queen (band)|Queen]] became a huge impact, in particular concerning the choir arrangements and harmonies, an effect most notable on ''[[A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.<ref name=\"Markus interview\"/>\n\nSinger Hansi K\u00fcrsch expressed the band's attraction to 1970s [[progressive rock]], for example early [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Gentle Giant]], and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|ELP]]. However, with regard to the genre, he sees the more direct influences in [[progressive metal]] bands, in particular [[Fates Warning]], [[Queensr\u00ffche]], and [[Savatage]].<ref name=\"Hansi interview\">{{Cite journal|title=Blind Guardian's music perseveres through many different eras |date=31 August 2012|publisher=Powerlinemag.com/|url=http://www.powerlinemag.com/2012/08/31/blind-guardians-music-perseveres-through-many-different-eras/|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> The folklorist influences on ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'' came mainly from British rock band [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].<ref name=\"Markus interview\"/>\n\n==Side projects==\nAlong with [[Jon Schaffer]], the leader and founder of [[Iced Earth]], K\u00fcrsch was a member of [[Demons and Wizards (band)|Demons and Wizards]], where he was the lead singer until its disbandment in early 2021.\n\nFrederik Ehmke was a founding member of the band [[Sinbreed]], in which Marcus Siepen was a session member. Later on, during 2012, Marcus became a full member of the band.\n\nAfter the tsunami that struck Japan on 11 March 2011, Blind Guardian worked with their former record company, [[EMI|EMI Music]], and auctioned off an exclusive studio session for two in the Twilight Hall Studio in Grefrath, Germany for charity.
