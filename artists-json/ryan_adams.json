He has released 22 albums, as well as three studio albums as a former member of [[rock music|rock]]/[[alternative country|alt-country]] band [[Whiskeytown]].\n\nIn 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'', to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the [[Shortlist Music Prize]]. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', which included the single, \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]]'' (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the [[rock (album)|classic rock]]-influenced ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' (2003), after a planned album, ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', was rejected by his label [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]]. As a compromise, ''Love Is Hell'' was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.\n\nAfter breaking his wrist during a live performance, Adams took a short break, and formed [[The Cardinals (rock band)|The Cardinals]], a backing band that accompanied him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, after the release of ''[[Cardinology]]'' (2009), Adams disbanded The Cardinals and announced an extended break from music due to complications from [[M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease]].<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ryan-adams-announces-split-from-the-cardinals-hiatus-20090114 |title=Ryan Adams announces split from the cardinals, hiatus|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 14, 2009}}</ref> The following year, however, Adams resumed performing and released his [[Glyn Johns]]-produced 13th studio album, ''[[Ashes & Fire]]'', in late 2011. The album peaked at No. 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In September 2014, Adams released his fourteenth album, ''[[Ryan Adams (album)|Ryan Adams]]'', on his own [[PAX AM]] label, and formed a new backing band, [[Ryan Adams & the Shining|The Shining]], to support the release.\n\nIn 2015, Adams released ''[[1989 (Ryan Adams album)|1989]]'', a song-for-song cover of [[Taylor Swift]]'s album of the same name, and worked on up to 80 songs for an album influenced by his divorce from actress and singer-songwriter [[Mandy Moore]]. The album, ''[[Prisoner (Ryan Adams album)|Prisoner]]'', was released in 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Adams announced three albums to be released that year. However, the release of these albums was indefinitely delayed after seven women came forward with [[sexual misconduct]] allegations against him. He later issued an apology, and the FBI cleared him of any potential criminal charges. Adams eventually released the planned albums, ''[[Wednesdays (album)|Wednesdays]]'', ''[[Big Colors]]'', and ''Chris'', yearly from 2020 to 2022. ''Chris'' was followed by three further albums, all released in 2022 as well.\n\nIn addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for [[Willie Nelson]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Jenny Lewis]], and [[Fall Out Boy]], and has collaborated with [[Counting Crows]], [[Weezer]], [[Norah Jones]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Leona Naess]], [[Toots and the Maytals]], [[Beth Orton]] and [[Krista Polvere]]. He has written ''[[Infinity Blues]]'', a book of poems, and ''[[Hello Sunshine (book)|Hello Sunshine]]'', a collection of poems and short stories.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Ryan Adams was born on November 5, 1974, in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]].<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ryan-adams-mn0000808336/biography|title=Ryan Adams Biography |first= Mark |last=Deming|access-date= February 14, 2019|website=[[AllMusic.com]]}}</ref> He is the middle of three children with an older brother and younger sister.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bobmehr/at-home-kinda-with-ryan-adams|title=Ryan Adams Finally Finds His Way Home|first=Bob |last=Mehr|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=September 7, 2014|access-date=November 28, 2014}}</ref> His childhood has been described as \"dysfunctional\".

In his own words, \"I started writing short stories when I was really into [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Then later, when I was a teenager, I got really hard into cult fiction: [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Jack Kerouac]].\" At 14, Adams began learning to play an electric guitar his mother and stepfather had bought him and soon joined a local band named Blank Label. While they quickly disbanded, they did record a short three-track 7-inch record, in 1991.<ref>{{cite book |last=Heatley |first=Michael |author-link= Michael Heatley |title= Ryan Adams |year=2003 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London, England|isbn=0-7119-9435-8  |pages=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\nAdams dropped out of [[Jacksonville High School (North Carolina)|Jacksonville High School]] in 10th grade, at the age of 16, subsequently moving into bandmate Jere McIlwean's rental house, just outside Jacksonville.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/ryan-adams/biography|title=Ryan Adams Biography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=Feb 24, 2018}}</ref> Around this time, he played and performed with a number of local bands, most notably his and McIlwean's The Patty Duke Syndrome.

Whiskeytown saw Adams move to [[Alternative country|alt-country]], describing [[punk rock]] as \"too hard to sing\" in the title track of Whiskeytown's debut album ''[[Faithless Street]]''. Whiskeytown was heavily influenced by a number of country-rock pioneers, most notably [[Gram Parsons]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inman |first1=Davis |title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons |url=https://americansongwriter.com/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/?nab=1 |website=American Songwriter|date=May 18, 2012 }}</ref> The band quickly gained critical acclaim with the release of their second full-length album, ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'', their first [[Record label|major label]] release. A third album, ''[[Pneumonia (album)|Pneumonia]],'' was completed in 1999, but record label problems delayed its release. It was eventually released by [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]] in 2001, at which time the band was effectively done.\n\n===Solo career (2000\u20132004)===\nAdams made his solo debut in 2000, with ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' (produced by [[Ethan Johns]]).<ref>[https://archive.today/20120712133705/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=112&csid2=4&fid1=26076 'Ryan Adams Grows Up']. An interview on Exclaim.ca</ref> [[Emmylou Harris]] sang backup on \"Oh My Sweet Carolina.\"  Other backing vocals and instruments were provided by [[Gillian Welch]], [[David Rawlings]], [[Pat Sansone]], and Kim Richey as Adams embraced a style more reminiscent of folk music.

It was well received. Adams, however, initially refused to promote the record through radio station meet-and-greets and other music-industry conventions, instead opting for more recording and some live dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} A video was eventually made for the album's first single, \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\". The music video featured Adams performing in front of the city's skyline four days before the [[September 11 attacks]]. The video was played often on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] after the attacks and became Adams's breakthrough to mainstream music consumers.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Gold'', in 2002 Adams was blocked by his label from releasing his choice for a follow-up album. This would be the second time, the first being with ''Gold;'' Adams had recorded \"the Suicide Handbook\" which was rejected on the grounds that it was \"too sad\". The label opted this time around to cherry pick (without Adams' involvement) from four of Adams' recorded albums it had already dismissed as unreleasable (48 Hours, The Suicide Handbook, The Pinkhearts and The Swedish Sessions) to create ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]],'' released in September 2002. Although the album garnered him more critical attention, it failed to sell as well as ''Gold''. The same year, Adams produced [[Jesse Malin]]'s first album, ''[[The Fine Art of Self Destruction]]'', and later worked with Malin to form the punk-rock group [[The Finger (band)|The Finger]] (under the pseudonyms, \"Warren Peace\" and \"Irving Plaza\" respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'', released on [[One Little Indian Records]] in 2003. He also starred in a [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] advertisement with Willie Nelson, performing a cover of Hank Williams's \"[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]\".\n\nIn May 2002, Adams joined Elton John on ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | title=CMT Crossroads: Elton John and Ryan Adams | access-date=2007-04-11 | publisher = [[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> which brings together country artists with musicians from other genres. During the show, John referred to Adams as \"fabulous one\" and spoke of how ''Heartbreaker'' inspired him to record ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]'', which at the time was his most successful album in several years. Also in 2002, Adams reportedly recorded a cover of [[The Strokes]]' debut album ''[[Is This It]]'', though it has never been publicly released.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/ryan-adams/11149 | title=Adams Different Strokes in Demand! | access-date=2007-04-11 | date=April 3, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, Adams worked on recording ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', intending to release it in 2003. [[Lost Highway Records]] deemed that it was not commercially viable and was reluctant to release it, leading Adams to go back to the studio. Two weeks later he returned to Lost Highway with ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock n Roll]]'', which featured guest musicians including [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], [[Green Day]]'s [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], and Adams's girlfriend at the time, [[Parker Posey]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=RJ |title=Ryan Adams, 'Rock N Roll' (Lost Highway) |url=https://www.spin.com/2003/11/ryan-adams-rock-n-roll-lost-highway/ |website=SPIN |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=3 August 2020}}</ref>  Adams' songwriting received additional exposure when [[Joan Baez]] included his song \"In My Time of Need\", from his debut release, on her 2003 album ''[[Dark Chords on a Big Guitar]].''\n\nAlso released in 2003, Adams formed a punk band called The Finger with [[Jesse Malin]], Colin Burns, and Johnny T. Yerington.<sup>[[The Finger (band)#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> The name derived from notorious early/mid-1990s [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] rock band Finger, of which Adams was a big fan. This light-hearted project allowed both artists to return to their punk backgrounds (Adams began his music career as singer for The Patty Duke Syndrome and Malin began his career in the hardcore punk band [[Heart Attack (band)|Heart Attack]] and more famously as the lead singer of [[D Generation]]). They began by releasing two EPs: ''We Are Fuck You'' and ''Punk's Dead Let's Fuck'' which were later collected to form the album ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'' that was released in 2003.\n\nAdams and Lost Highway Records eventually agreed that the label would release ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' as well as ''Love Is Hell'', on the condition that ''Love Is Hell'' be split into two EP installments. ''Rock N Roll'' and ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 1'' were released in November 2003, followed by ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 2'' in December. Both albums were well received by critics, and in May 2004 ''Love Is Hell'' was re-released as a full-length album.\n\n''Love Is Hell'' included a cover of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis']] \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\", which Adams had previously performed live, and about which [[Noel Gallagher]] once said, \"I never got my head round this song until I went to [see] Ryan Adams play and he did an amazing cover of it.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/oasis/12909 | title = The 'Wonder' of Ryan | access-date=2007-04-11| date=October 31, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref> The song earned Adams a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for \"[[Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance|Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |title=Kanye West is at top of Grammy list |access-date=2012-08-15 |date=December 8, 2004 |publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629020925/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nWhile on tour to support ''Love Is Hell'' in January 2004, Adams fractured his wrist during a performance at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Royal Court Theatre]] in Liverpool.

''Cold Roses'', a double album, included backing vocals from [[Rachael Yamagata]] on three songs; \"Let It Ride\", \"Cold Roses\" and \"Friends\".  His second album of the year, ''Jacksonville City Nights'', featured a duet with [[Norah Jones]] on \"Dear John\". As well as releasing two albums with The Cardinals, Adams released the solo album ''[[29 (album)|29]]'' late in the year.\n\nIn addition to releasing three albums, that year Adams joined other musicians in playing a [[Hurricane Katrina]] benefit show at [[The Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza|Irving Plaza]] in New York City. Also, three of Adams's songs were featured in the [[Elizabethtown (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'': \"Come Pick Me Up\", \"English Girls Approximately\", and a new song called \"Words\", which was pulled from 2005's ''The Elizabethtown Sessions'' and remains unreleased, but is floating among collectors as ''Darkbreaker''. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.  \"Words\" was released later in a second volume of Elizabethtown songs.\n\nAdams befriended [[Phil Lesh]] of the [[Grateful Dead]], after first meeting him at the [[Jammys]] awards in New York in 2005. The two performed [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]'s Grateful Dead classic, \"Wharf Rat\". Adams performed at subsequent outings of [[Phil Lesh and Friends]], including a two-night stand at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] outside of [[Denver]], Colorado and on New Year's Eve 2005 at the Bill Graham Event Center in San Francisco. Throughout 2006, Lesh's live performances included compositions by Adams, including several from ''Cold Roses'' (\"Cold Roses\", \"Let It Ride\", and \"Magnolia Mountain\").\n\nIn early 2006 Adams performed a solo tour of the United Kingdom, often accompanied by Brad Pemberton (drummer for The Cardinals) and on the final date in London by Carina Round, who performed harmony vocals on 'Come Pick Me Up' from his first solo album- 'Heartbreaker'. Also present was Cardinals guitarist- [[Neal Casal]]. Adams then toured the United States with The Cardinals, including a performance at [[Lollapalooza]] in Chicago. Adams and The Cardinals then returned to the UK in the summer to begin a tour of Europe.\n\nAdams produced [[Willie Nelson]]'s album ''[[Songbird (Willie Nelson album)|Songbird]]'', while he and The Cardinals performed as Nelson's backing band.  The album was released in October 2006.  He also opened for Nelson at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] later that fall, a show that featured [[Phil Lesh]] on bass and multiple [[Grateful Dead]] songs.  Late in 2006, Adams experimented with [[hip hop music]], adding to his web site 18 albums worth of new recordings under various pseudonyms, featuring humorous and nonsensical lyrics, as well as covers of two [[Bob Dylan]] songs (\"[[Isis (song)|Isis]]\" and \"[[You're a Big Girl Now]]\").\n\nAdams was scheduled to play [[Stonehenge]] when the Stonehenge society had to cancel the gigs to an overwhelming response to email or call-in for free tickets. They feared the highway would have to be shut down during the performance due to the demand for tickets.
