Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they were one of the most groundbreaking acts in the history of [[popular music]]. They were responsible for initiating the [[Punk subculture|punk movement]] in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and [[alternative rock]] musicians. Their fashion and hairstyles were a significant influence on [[punk fashion|punk image]], and they are often associated with [[anarchism]] within music.\n\nThe Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten ([[John Lydon]]), guitarist [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], drummer [[Paul Cook]], and bassist [[Glen Matlock]]; Matlock was replaced by [[Sid Vicious]] in early 1977. Under the management of [[Malcolm McLaren]], the band attracted some controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain. Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single \"[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]\", the latter of which attacked Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they popularized punk rock in the UK. \"God Save the Queen\" was banned by the [[BBC]] and nearly every independent radio station in Britain, making it one of the most censored records in British history.\n\nThe Sex Pistols' only album, ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]]'' (1977) \u2014 a UK number one \u2014 is a staple record of punk rock. In January 1978, at the end of their turbulent tour of the US, Rotten announced the band's breakup. Over the next few months, the three remaining members recorded songs for McLaren's film of the Sex Pistols' story, ''[[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle]]''. Vicious died of a [[heroin overdose]] in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, [[Nancy Spungen]]. A film about the couple, ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'', was released in 1986. Rotten, Jones, Cook, and Matlock reunited for a successful tour in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web| author = Silvia, not Sylvia       |date=2020-02-02|title=Interview with The Sex Pistols' bass guitarist Glen Matlock|url=https://the-shortlisted.co.uk/glen-matlock-sex-pistols-interview/|access-date=2022-06-12 |archive-url  =   https://web.archive.org/web/20200509234045/https://the-shortlisted.co.uk/glen-matlock-sex-pistols-interview/    |archive-date=    2020-05-09      |website=The Shortlisted|language=en-GB}}</ref> Further one-off performances and short tours followed over the next decade.\n\nThe Sex Pistols have been recognised as an influential band.<ref name=\"S&S\">{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Camilla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQ6YL6I7KFcC&q=sex+pistols|title=Popular Music Theory: Grade 4|last2=Skinner|first2=Tony|publisher=Registry Publications Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-1-89-846644-4|pages=29\u201330|access-date=28 May 2010}}</ref> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed them No.&nbsp;58 on its list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\".

McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival [[Teddy Boy]] theme.

Effectively agreeing, McLaren paid for their first formal rehearsal space. [[Glen Matlock]], an art student who occasionally worked at 'Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die', was recruited as the band's regular bassist.<ref>Savage, Jon. ''England's Dreaming'', pp. 70\u201380.</ref> In November, McLaren temporarily relocated to New York City. Before his departure, he and Westwood had conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed [[SEX (boutique)|''SEX'']], it changed its focus from retro couture to [[Sadomasochism|S&M]]-inspired ''\"anti-fashion\"'', with a billing as \"Specialists in rubberwear, glamourwear & stagewear\".<ref>Savage, Jon.

Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.<ref name=JL74/><ref>Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', pp. 120\u2013121; Matlock, Glen, ''I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol'', p. 71.</ref>\n\nLydon later described the social context in which the band came together:\n\n<blockquote>\nEarly Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment\u2014just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from the wrong side of the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious ''moi'' and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.<ref>Robb, John, ''Punk Rock'', p. 97. See also Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', pp. 108\u2013112. Savage notes that the July 1975 unemployment figures were the worst since World War II (p. 108).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nJournalist [[Nick Kent]] of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' (''NME'') jammed occasionally with the band, but left upon Lydon's recruitment. \"When I came along, I took one look at him and said, 'No.&nbsp;That has to go,'\" Lydon later explained. \"He's never written a good word about me ever since.\"<ref>Lydon, John, ''Rotten'', p. 78. See also Matlock, Glen, ''I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol'', pp. 57\u201359.</ref> In September, McLaren again helped hire a private rehearsal space for the group, who had been practising in pubs. Cook, who had a full-time job he was loath to give up, was making noises about quitting. According to Matlock's later description, Cook \"created a smokescreen\" by claiming Jones was not skilled enough to be the band's sole guitarist. An advertisement was placed in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' for a \"Whizz Kid Guitarist. Not older than 20. Not worse looking than [[Johnny Thunders]]\" (referring to the lead guitarist of the New York Dolls, and later the Heartbreakers).<ref>Matlock, Glen, ''I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol'', p. 86.</ref> Most of those who auditioned were incompetent, but in McLaren's view, the process created a new sense of solidarity among the four band members.<ref>Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', pp. 125\u2013126.</ref> [[Steve New]] was considered the one talented guitarist to have tried out and the band invited him to join. Jones was improving rapidly, however, and the band's developing sound had no room for the technical lead work at which New was adept. He departed after a month.<ref>Matlock, Glen, ''I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol'', p. 87.</ref>\n\nLydon had been rechristened \"Johnny Rotten\" by Jones, apparently because of his bad teeth.<ref name=\"rstn\"/><ref>Robb, John, ''Punk Rock'', p. 112; Strongman, Phil, ''Pretty Vacant'', p. 105.</ref> The band also settled on a name. After considering options such as Le Bomb, Subterraneans, the Damned, Beyond, Teenage Novel, Kid Gladlove, and Cr\u00e8me de la Cr\u00e8me, they decided on Sex Pistols\u2014a shortened form of the name they had apparently been working under informally.<ref>Evans, Mike, ''Rock 'n' Roll's Strangest Moments'', p. 190; Matlock, Glen, ''I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol'', pp. 64\u201365. Matlock says the band decided on the name while McLaren was in the United States\u2014no later than May 1975\u2014before Rotten even joined (p. 65). Jon Savage says the name was not firmly settled on until just before their first show in November 1975 (''England's Dreaming'', p. 129).</ref> McLaren later said the name derived \"from the idea of a pistol, a pin-up, a young thing, a better-looking assassin\". Not given to modesty, false or otherwise, he added: \"[I] launched the idea in the form of a band of kids who could be perceived as being bad.\"<ref>Molon, Dominic, \"Made with the Highest British Attention\", p. 76.</ref> The group began writing original material: Rotten was the lyricist and Matlock the primary melody writer (though their first collaboration, \"[[Pretty Vacant]]\", had a complete lyric by Matlock, which Rotten tweaked a bit); official credit was shared equally among the four.<ref>Strongman, Phil, ''Pretty Vacant'', pp. 99\u2013100.</ref><ref name=SR89>Reynolds, Simon, \"Ono, Eno, Arto\", p. 89.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sex Pistols, August 1975.jpg|thumb|right|The Sex Pistols in late 1975; L-R: Rotten, Matlock, Jones, and Cook]]\n\nTheir first gig was arranged by Matlock, who was studying at [[Saint Martin's School of Art|Saint Martins College]].

Before the Pistols could play the few original songs they had written to date, Bazooka Joe pulled the plugs as they saw their gear being trashed. A brief physical altercation between members of the two bands took place on stage.<ref>Strongman, Phil, ''Pretty Vacant'', p. 106; Robb, John, ''Punk Rock'', pp. 114\u2013120; {{cite news | author= Robb, John| date= 5 November 2005 | title=The Birth of Punk | work=The Independent| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-birth-of-punk-324977.html | access-date=15 October 2006 | location=London}} Strongman says that Rotten was pinned to the wall by Bazooka Joe's Danny Kleinman; after an apology, the Pistols continued playing for a few more minutes.

Over the next several months, McLaren arranged for recordings in Brazil (with Jones and Cook), Paris (with Vicious) and London; each of the three and others stepped in as lead vocalists on tracks that in some cases were far from what punk was expected to sound like. These recordings were to make up the musical soundtrack for the reconceived Pistols feature film project, directed by Julien Temple, to which McLaren was now devoting himself. On 30 June, a single credited to the Sex Pistols was released: on one side, notorious criminal [[Ronnie Biggs]] sang \"[[No One Is Innocent (song)|No One Is Innocent]]\" accompanied by Jones and Cook; on the other, Vicious sang the classic \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\", over both a Jones\u2013Cook backing track and a string orchestra.<ref>Gimarc, George, ''Punk Diary'', p. 145.

On 14 February, the court put the film and its soundtrack into [[receivership]]\u2014no longer under McLaren's control, they were now to be administered as exploitable assets for addressing the band members' financial claims.

It is mostly composed of tracks credited to the Sex Pistols; there are the new recordings with vocals by Jones, Vicious, Cook, and Ronnie Biggs, as well as [[Edward Tudor-Pole]], who recorded a scene for the Sex Pistols' film. McLaren himself takes the mic for a couple of numbers. Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early, unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded backing by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco. The album is completed by a couple of tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols classics.<ref>Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', pp. 531\u2013536, 558; Gimarc, George, ''Punk Diary'', p. 188. Savage says there are six Rotten vocals (p. 558); in fact, the various releases of the album all include seven or eight.</ref>\n\nFour Top Ten singles were culled from the ''Swindle'' recordings, one more than had appeared on ''Never Mind the Bollocks''. The 1978 \"No One Is Innocent\"/\"My Way\" was followed in 1979 by Vicious's cover of \"[[Somethin' Else (Eddie Cochran song)|Something Else]]\" (number three, and the biggest-selling single ever under the Sex Pistols name); Jones singing an original, \"Silly Thing\" (number six); and Vicious's second Cochran cover, \"[[C'mon Everybody]]\" (number three). Two more singles from the soundtrack were put out under the Pistols brand\u2014Tudor-Pole, among others, singing \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" and a Rotten vocal from 1976, \"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\"; both fell just shy of the Top Twenty.<ref>Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', pp. 558\u2013559; Gimarc, George, ''Punk Diary'', pp. 145, 188, 196, 217.</ref> On 21 November 1980, the final \"new\" studio recordings attributed to the Sex Pistols were released by Virgin: \"Black Leather\" and \"Here We Go Again\", recorded by Jones and Cook during the mid-1978 ''Swindle'' sessions, were paired as one of a half-dozen 7-inch records (the other five reconfiguring previously released material) sold together as ''Sex Pack''.<ref>Gimarc, George, ''Punk Diary'', p. 405; Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', pp. 501, 560.</ref>\n\nThe Sex Pistols film was completed by Temple, who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production. Finally released in 1980, ''The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle'' still largely reflects McLaren's vision. It is a fictionalised, farcical, partially animated retelling of the band's history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role, Jones as second lead, and contributions from Vicious (including his memorable performance of \"My Way\") and Cook. It incorporates promotional videos shot for \"God Save the Queen\" and \"Pretty Vacant\" and extensive documentary footage as well, much of it focusing on Rotten. In Temple's description, he and McLaren conceived it as a \"very stylized...polemic\". They were reacting to the fact that the Pistols had become the \"poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god. And that was never the point.... The myth had to be dynamited in some way. We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans\".<ref>Salewicz, Chris, ''Interview with Julien Temple'', 11:49\u201311:55, 13:19\u201313:36.</ref> In the film, McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren's teaching a series of \"lessons\" to be learned from \"an invention of mine they called the punk rock\".<ref>{{cite magazine| date=23 May 2005| title=Sex Pistols 'Swindle' Again| magazine=Billboard| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000929906| access-date=9 September 2006| archive-date=29 September 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929161408/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000929906| url-status=dead}} Quote: Temple, Julien, ''The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle'', 1:23\u20131:25.</ref>\n\nCook and Jones continued to work through guest appearances and as [[session musician]]s.

A confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands.\"<ref name=\"IR\">Robbins, Ira, \"Sex Pistols\", p. 585.</ref> Critic Toby Creswell locates the primary source of inspiration somewhat differently. Noting that \"[i]mage to the contrary, the Pistols were very serious about music\", he argues, \"the real rebel yell came from Jones' guitars: a mass wall of sound based on the most simple, retro guitar riffs. Essentially, the Sex Pistols reinforced what the garage bands of the '60s had demonstrated\u2014you don't need technique to make rock & roll. In a time when music had been increasingly complicated and defanged, the Sex Pistols' generational shift caused a real revolution.\"<ref name=TC>Creswell, Toby, ''1001 Songs'', p. 735.</ref>\n\n{{quotebox|width=23.5em|quote=Nothing would have happened without the Pistols. It was like, \"Wow, I believe in this.\" What they were saying was: \"It's a load of shite. I'm going to do what I do and I don't care what people think.\" That was the key to it. People forget that, but it was the main ideology for me: we don't care what you think\u2014you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that got people moving, as well as the music.|source=\u2013 [[Pauline Murray]]<ref>Robb, John, ''Punk Rock'', p. 163.</ref>}}\n\nAlthough much of the Sex Pistols' energy was directed against the establishment, not all of rock's elder statesmen dismissed them. [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] said:\n<blockquote>\nWhen you listen to the Sex Pistols, to \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" and \"Bodies\" and tracks like that, what immediately strikes you is that ''this is actually happening.'' This is a bloke, with a brain on his shoulders, who is actually saying something he ''sincerely'' believes is happening in the world, saying it with real venom, and real passion. It touches you and it scares you\u2014it makes you feel uncomfortable. It's like somebody saying, \"The Germans are coming!  And there's no way we're gonna stop 'em!\"<ref>Marcus, Greil, ''Lipstick Traces'', p. 1.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlong with their abundant musical influence, the Sex Pistols' cultural reverberations are evident elsewhere. Jamie Reid's work for the band is regarded as among the most important graphic design of the 1970s and still influences the field in the 21st century.<ref>Raimes, Jonathan et al., ''Retro Graphics'', p. 164; \"Jamie Reid: The Art of Punk\" (June 2004), ''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/6285080/Computer-Arts-06-2004 Computer Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206062157/http://www.scribd.com/doc/6285080/Computer-Arts-06-2004 |date=6 December 2008 }}'', pp. 46\u201348.</ref> By the age of twenty-one, Sid Vicious was already a \"t-shirt-selling icon\".<ref>Strongman, Phil, ''Pretty Vacant'', p. 235.</ref> While the manner of his death signified for many the inevitable failure of punk's social ambitions, it cemented his image as an archetype of doomed youth.<ref>Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', p. 530.</ref> British [[punk fashion]], still widely influential, is now customarily credited to Westwood and McLaren; as Johnny Rotten, Lydon had a lasting effect as well, especially through his [[bricolage]] approach to personal style: he \"would wear a velvet collared drape jacket ([[teddy boy|ted]]) festooned with safety pins ([[Jackie Curtis]] through the New York punk scene), massive pin-stripe pegs (modernist), a pin-collar Wemblex ([[Mod (subculture)#Fashion|mod]]) customised into an Anarchy shirt (punk) and [[brothel creepers]] (ted).\"<ref>Douglas, Mark, \"Fashions, Youth\", pp. 188\u2013189.

See also Gimarc, George, p. 102. McLaren echoes the line in ''The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle'': \"Do you realise, these kids didn't buy the records for the music. If that was the case, this thing would have died a death years ago\" (10:56\u201311:03).</ref> \n\nHe claimed that the Sex Pistols were his personal, Situationist-style art project: \"I decided to use people, just the way a sculptor uses clay.\"<ref name=SR89/> \"Punk became the most important cultural phenomenon of the late 20th century\", McLaren later asserted. \"Its authenticity stands out against the karaoke ersatz culture of today, where everything and everyone is for sale.... [P]unk is not, and never was, for sale.\"<ref name=MM07>{{cite news | author=McLaren, Malcolm|date=15 September 2007 | title=Searching for a Way to Break the Rules | work=Guardian| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2007/sep/15/greatinterviews2| access-date=23 March 2009 | location=London}}</ref> They were something with which \"to sell trousers\", as McLaren said in 1989;<ref>Hibbert, Tom (August 1989), \"Pernicious?

See also Temple's script for the film's promotional video: Gimarc, George, ''Punk Diary'', pp. 328\u2013329.</ref>\n\nLydon, in turn, dismissed McLaren's influence: \"We made our own scandal just by being ourselves. Maybe it was that he knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. All the talk about the French Situationists being associated with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!\"<ref>Lydon, John, ''Rotten'', p. 3.</ref> Cook concurs: \"Situationism had nothing to do with us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of.\"<ref>Lydon, John, ''Rotten'', p. 186.</ref> According to Lydon, \"If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time.\"<ref name=LV/>\n\nToby Creswell argues that the \"Sex Pistols' agenda was inchoate, to say the least. It was a general call to rebellion that falls apart at the slightest scrutiny.\"<ref name=TC/> Critic Ian Birch, writing in 1981, called \"stupid\" the claim that the Sex Pistols \"had any political significance.... If they did anything, they made a lot of people content with being nothing. They certainly didn't inspire the working classes.\"<ref>Mulholland, Neil, ''The Cultural Devolution'', p. 68.</ref> While the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|Conservative triumph in 1979]] may be taken as evidence for that position, Julien Temple has noted that the scene inspired by the Sex Pistols \"wasn't your kind of two-up, two-down working class normal families, most of it. It was over the edge of the precipice in social terms. They were actually giving a voice to an area of the working class that was almost beyond the pale.\"<ref>Salewicz, Chris, ''Interview with Julien Temple'', 1:13\u20131:28.</ref> Within a year of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" that voice was being echoed widely: scores if not hundreds of punk bands had formed across the country\u2014groups composed largely of working-class members or middle-class members who rejected their own class values and pursued solidarity with the working class.<ref>Albiez, Sean, \"Print the Truth\", p. 100; Henry, Tricia, ''Break All Rules'', p. xi.</ref>\n\nIn 1980, critic [[Greil Marcus]] reflected on McLaren's contradictory posture:\n<blockquote>\nIt may be that in the mind of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never meant to be more than a nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old ''[[\u00e9pater la bourgeoisie]]''. It may also be that in the mind of their chief terrorist and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.<ref>Hatch, David, and Stephen Millward, ''From Blues to Rock'', p. 170.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nA couple of years before, Marcus had identified different roots underlying the band's merger of music and politics, arguing that they \"have absorbed from [[reggae]] and the [[Rastafari movement|Rastas]] the idea of a culture that will make demands on those in power which no government could ever satisfy; a culture that will be exclusive, almost separatist, yet also messianic, apocalyptic and stoic, and that will ignore or smash any contradiction inherent in such a complexity of stances.\"<ref name=PN/> Critic Sean Campbell has discussed how Lydon's Irish Catholic heritage both facilitated his entr\u00e9e into London's reggae scene and complicated his position for the ethnically English working class\u2014the background his bandmates had in common.<ref>Campbell, Sean, \"Sounding Out the Margins\", pp. 127\u2013130.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sex Pistols in Paradiso - Johnny Rotten 2.jpg|thumb|Johnny Rotten on stage in Paradiso, Amsterdam, January 1977]]\n\nCritic Bill Wyman acknowledges that Lydon's \"fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma\" were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's real meaning lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations.<ref name=BW/> While some of the Sex Pistols' public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not\u2014including what McLaren himself cites as the \"pivotal moment that changed everything\",<ref name=MM07/> the clash on the Bill Grundy ''Today'' show.<ref>See, for instance, Temple's commentary: \"[It] was not planned at all. It was totally spontaneous. And as the band will tell you, Malcolm said, 'You've blown it. You've ruined everything I've worked for'\" (Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 27:26\u201327:33); and Matlock's confirmation (Matlock, Glen, ''I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol'', pp. 145, 147). Concerning the time the band spent waiting to go on air, Siouxsie Sioux later said, \"I've got a feeling that Malcolm ''was'' geeing them up, stirring it a bit\" (Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', p. 257). Her view is belied by the version of the incident in Phil Strongman's ''Pretty Vacant'', which appears to rely on McLaren himself (pp. 154\u2013155). According to Strongman, McLaren \"was inconsolable\" (p. 154).</ref> \"Malcolm milked situations\", says Cook, \"he didn't instigate them; that was always our own doing.\"<ref>Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', p. 338.</ref> Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band, it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren \"was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets.... However, on the other hand, I've since found out that even Malcolm wasn't as aware of what he was up to as he has since made out.\"<ref>Matlock, Glen, ''I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol'', p. 170.</ref> By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band's creativity: in the eleven months between his departure and the Pistols' demise, they composed only two songs.<ref>Strongman, Phil, ''Pretty Vacant'', p. 198.</ref>\n\nMusic historian [[Simon Reynolds]] argues that McLaren came into his own as an [[auteur]] only after the group's break-up, with ''The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle'' and the recruitment of Ronnie Biggs as a vocalist.<ref name=SR89/> Much subsequent commentary on the Sex Pistols has relied on taking seriously McLaren's onscreen proclamations in the film, whether lending them credence or not. As music journalist Dave Thompson noted in 2000, \"[T]oday, ''Swindle'' is viewed by many as the truth\"<ref>Thompson, Dave, ''Alternative Rock'', p. 135.</ref> (despite the fact that the movie purveys, among other things, a completely illiterate Steve Jones, a talking dog, and Sid Vicious shooting audience members, including his mother, at the conclusion of \"My Way\"). Temple points out that McLaren's characterization was intended as \"a big fucking joke\u2014that he was the puppetmeister who created these pieces of clay from plasticine boxes that he modeled away and made Johnny Rotten, made Sid Vicious. It was a ''joke'' that they were completely manufactured.\"<ref>Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 1:24\u20131:40.</ref> (In his final onscreen scene in the film, McLaren declares that he was planning the Sex Pistols affair, \"Ever since I was ten years old! Ever since [[Elvis Presley]] joined the army!\" [1956 and 1958, respectively].)<ref>Temple, Julien, ''The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle'', 1:12:54\u20131:13:02.</ref> Temple acknowledges that McLaren ultimately \"perhaps took this too much to heart.\"<ref>Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 1:20\u20131:23.</ref>\n\nAccording to Pistols tour manager Noel Monk and journalist Jimmy Guterman, Lydon was much more than \"the band's mouthpiece. He's its raging brain. McLaren or his friend Jamie Reid might drop a word like 'anarchy' or 'vacant' that Rotten seizes upon and turns into a manifesto, but McLaren is not the Svengali to Rotten he'd like to be perceived as. McLaren thought he was working with a tabula rasa, but he soon found out that Rotten has ideas of his own\".<ref>Monk, Noel, and Jimmy Guterman, ''12 Days on the Road'', pp. 76\u201377.</ref> On the other hand, there is little disagreement about McLaren's marketing talent and his crucial role in making the band a [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomenon soon after its debut.<ref name=BW/><ref>Monk, Noel, and Jimmy Guterman, ''12 Days on the Road'', p. 77.</ref> Temple adds that \"he catalyzed so many people's heads. He had so many just extraordinary ideas\".<ref>Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 37:03\u201337:09.</ref> Though, as Jon Savage emphasises, \"In fact, it was Steve Jones who first had the idea of putting the group, or any group, together with McLaren. He chose McLaren, not vice versa.\"<ref>Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', p. 71.</ref>\n\n== Band members ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Official members\n* [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]]&nbsp;\u2013
