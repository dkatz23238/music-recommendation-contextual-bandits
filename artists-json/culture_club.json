The song \"[[Time (Clock of the Heart)]]\" is included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of 500 songs that shaped rock and roll.\n\nTheir second album, ''[[Colour by Numbers]]'', sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.

Ten of their singles reached the US Top 40, where they are associated with the [[Second British Invasion]] of British [[New wave music|new wave]] groups that became popular in the US due to the cable music channel [[MTV]]. Culture Club's music combines British [[New wave music|new wave]] and American soul and pop.

Rock on the Net. Retrieved 30 October 2012</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1981\u20131983: Formation and ''Kissing to Be Clever'' ===\n\nIn 1981, [[Blitz Kids|Blitz Club]] regular Boy George occasionally sang with the group [[Bow Wow Wow]], performing under the stage name Lieutenant Lush with the group. After his tenure with the group ended, George decided to start his own band and enlisted bassist Mikey Craig, drummer Jon Moss, and finally guitarist Roy Hay joined the group.\n\nRealizing they had an Irish gay man as the lead singer, a black Briton on bass, a blond Englishman on guitar and keyboards, and a Jewish drummer, they eventually decided to name the group Culture Club. The group recorded demos, which were paid for by [[EMI]] Records, but the label was unimpressed and decided not to sign the group. [[Virgin Records]] heard the demos and signed the group in the UK, releasing their albums in Europe, while [[Epic Records]] released their albums in the United States and much of the rest of the world.\n\nThe band released two singles in May and June 1982, \"White Boy\" and \"I'm Afraid of Me\", though both failed to chart.<ref name=\"Cohen (1984) 76\">{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Scott |title=Boy George |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=cohen+%22culture+club%22+%22White+Boy%22+%22I%27m+Afraid+of+Me%22&btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&hl=en&tbo=1&tbs=bks:1&q=Scott+Cohen+1984++%22Culture+Club%22+%22White+Boy%22+%22I%27m+Afraid+of+Me%22&aq=&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&psj=1&fp=f989debfaff70b96 |publisher=Berkley Books |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-425-07639-2 |page=76 |access-date=28 October 2010 }}</ref> In September of that year, the group released their third single, \"[[Do You Really Want to Hurt Me]]\", a reggae-influenced number, which became one of their biggest hits.<ref name=\"Cohen (1984) 76\"/> The song went to No.&nbsp;1 in the UK in late 1982 and became an international smash, topping the charts in twenty-three countries (No.&nbsp;2 in the US), and the top ten in several more countries.\n\nThe band's 1982 debut on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' created [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] headlines, which focused on George's [[androgynous]] style of dress and sexual ambiguity. Magazines began to feature George prominently on their covers. [[Pete Burns]], lead singer of the new wave band [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]], would later claim he was the first to wear braids, big hats, and colourful costumes, but George would cut back with a sharp-tongued remark, \"It's not who did it first, it's who did it better.\"\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Kissing to Be Clever]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;5, US No.&nbsp;14) was released in October 1982, and the follow-up single, \"[[Time (Clock of the Heart)]]\", became another Top 10 hit in the US (Number 2) and UK (Number 3). \"[[I'll Tumble 4 Ya]]\" also became a Top Ten hit in the US (Number 9) and in Canada. This gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group since [[The Beatles]] to have three Top Ten hits in America from a debut album.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0zQDAwAAQBAJ&q=Culture+Club+the+first+group+since+The+Beatles+to+have+three+Top+Ten+hits+in+America+from+a+debut+album&pg=PT196|title=The Million Sellers|last=Press|first=Omnibus|date=4 November 2012|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-882-9|language=en}}</ref> ''Kissing to Be Clever'' sold over 1.5&nbsp;million copies in the US, being certified platinum.\n\n=== 1983\u20131984: ''Colour by Numbers'' ===\n\nThe band's second album, ''[[Colour by Numbers]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;1, US No.&nbsp;2), was released in 1983. The first single, \"[[Church of the Poison Mind]]\", featuring backing vocalist [[Helen Terry]], reached the UK and US Top 10. The second single, \"[[Karma Chameleon]]\", gave the band their biggest hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;1 in the UK (the band's second chart-topper there), where it became the best selling single of 1983 and has sold 1.5&nbsp;million copies there to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/daft-punks-get-lucky-becomes-one-of-the-uks-biggest-selling-singles-of-all-time-2315/|title=UK Official Charts Company (Top Selling Singles of All-Time)|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=26 October 2018}}</ref> It also peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in the US for three consecutive weeks, and would ultimately hit No.&nbsp;1 in 30 countries, thus becoming one of the top twenty best-selling singles of the 1980s sold up seven million copies worldwide, with one of the most iconic images of Boy George on the cover shot by photographer [[David Levine (photographer)|David Levine]].\n\nThe album ''Colour by Numbers'' would spawn more hits including \"[[Miss Me Blind]]\" (#5 US), \"[[It's a Miracle (Culture Club song)|It's a Miracle]]\" (#4 UK, No. 13 US), and \"[[Victims (song)|Victims]]\" (#3 UK), and sold four million copies in the US and another five million worldwide at its time of release. The album gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group in music history to have an album certified diamond in Canada (for sales of one million copies in that country). The band also won the 1984 [[Brit Award]] for Best Group and the [[Grammy Award]] for Best New Artist, where George gave a speech via satellite stating, \"Thanks America, you've got style, you've got taste, and you know a good drag queen when you see one.\"\n\nThe group's back-up singer, [[Helen Terry]], began work on her solo album, for which George and Hay wrote the song \"Love Lies Lost\". The pair also wrote \"Passing Friend\" for the [[The Beach Boys (album)|Beach Boys' album]]. Culture Club wrote two songs for the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Electric Dreams (film)|Electric Dreams]]''. George and Hay wrote \"The Dream\" and \"Love Is Love\", with the latter being released as a single in Canada, Japan and South America, the E.P \"Love is Love\" became a major hit in Brazil. George also collaborated on the song \"Electric Dreams\", sung by [[P. P. Arnold]]. The song was written with [[Phil Pickett]] (former member of the 1970s band [[Sailor (band)|Sailor]]) who had also co-written \"Karma Chameleon\" and frequently played keyboards for the group.\n\nDespite Culture Club's commercial success, there were significant pressures within the band. George was using drugs with money from his new-found fame. George and Moss were also romantically involved with each other, which was unknown to the public and the media at the time. Their relationship lasted for over four years and was often turbulent, with alleged physical and verbal abuse from both sides. Their constant arguments and the pressure to hide the relationship from the public started to take its toll on the band.\n\n=== 1984\u20131986: ''Waking Up with the House on Fire'', ''From Luxury to Heartache'' and decline ===\n\nIn 1984, the group released their third album ''[[Waking Up with the House on Fire]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;2, US No.&nbsp;26) which sold 2.8&nbsp;million copies worldwide. Although certified platinum in both the UK and the US, it was a commercial and critical disappointment compared to their first two albums. The album contained the hit single \"The War Song\", which reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK, and Top 20 in the US. Other singles like \"Mistake No.&nbsp;3\" (US No.&nbsp;33) and \"The Medal Song\" (UK No.&nbsp;32) would become modest hits. George later stated he felt the album experienced a lukewarm reception because of half-hearted material he felt they released due to pressure from Virgin and Epic. According to him, the band had just come off an exhausting world tour in 1984.\n\nAt the end of 1984, Boy George was recruited by [[Bob Geldof]] to join the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] recording, consisting of mostly internationally known UK and Irish recording stars. George was in New York City for an appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' when Geldof called him, but managed to catch the final [[Concorde]] of the day to London and was the last singer to record a lead vocal track for the song \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\". The song would become the biggest selling single of all-time in the UK and a huge international hit, raising millions for famine victims in several African nations, particularly Ethiopia.\n\nDue to all the heartache from the break-up of his relationship with Moss, and all the ensuing tension with rest of the band, George turned to relief in drugs. Consequently, he soon developed a self-destructive drug [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], which in merely four months escalated from [[marijuana]] to heroin. By 1986, George had become seriously [[Substance use disorder|addicted]]. The recording of their fourth studio album, 1986's ''[[From Luxury to Heartache]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;10, US No.&nbsp;32) dragged on for so long that producer [[Arif Mardin]] had to abandon the sessions due to prior commitments and leave it to engineer Lew Hahn to finish the sessions. Nevertheless, the first single \"[[Move Away]]\" became a hit, peaking at UK No.&nbsp;7 and US No.&nbsp;12 and appeared the album would return the group back to its previous success. But by the time of the release of the second single \"God Thank You Woman\", news of George's drug addiction began to circulate in British and American [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]], and the second single stalled on its way up the charts, failing to make a big impact.\n\nGeorge and Moss also no longer wanted to be around each other due to the constant relationship battles and with George's addiction. ''From Luxury to Heartache'' began to fade from the charts as well, and the album ultimately sold less than one million copies worldwide at the time of release. By the summer of 1986, George finally admitted that he was indeed addicted to drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/boy-george-comes-clean-and-tries-to-come-back-after-heroin-addiction-and-his-pals-drug-deaths-vol-28-no-8/|title=Boy George Comes Clean\u2014and Tries to Come Back\u2014After Heroin Addiction and His Pals' Drug Deaths|website=PEOPLE.com|language=EN|access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref> In July of that year, he was arrested by the British police for possession of heroin. The band broke up and George pursued a solo career, having several European hits and a couple of US Top 40 hits.\n\n=== Reunions ===\n\n==== 1989 ====\n\nThe band first tried to reunite in 1989, after many requests from Tony Gordon, the group's former manager and George's manager at that time. George agreed to try some songs with the band again, resulting in recording sessions and producing more than a dozen songs that remain unreleased. George, however, was more excited about his future projects like his record label, More Protein, and his new [[acid house]] project [[Jesus Loves You (band)|Jesus Loves You]]. The proposed reunion ended up being cancelled.\n\n==== 1998\u20132000, 2002 ====\n\nIn 1998, George and Moss put their differences aside and the band reunited to do a reunion tour, kicking off with a performance on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''.<ref name=\"LAT (1998)\"/> George said about the reunion, \"Culture Club's reunion couldn't have come at a better time for rock\", adding that, \"It's a nostalgia trip, there's no way of avoiding that.\"<ref name=\"LAT (1998)\">{{cite news |title=Culture Club Reunites, but It May Be Just Nostalgic Fling |first=Roger |last=Catlin |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=12 August 1998 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/32812009.html?dids=32812009:32812009&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+12,+1998&author=ROGER+CATLIN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Culture+Club+Reunites,+but+It+May+Be+Just+Nostalgic+Fling;+Pop+music:+Lead+singer+Boy+George+says+regrouped+'80s+band+members+are+putting+aside+differences,+at+least+while+on+tour.&pqatl=google |access-date=15 November 2010}}</ref> The tour was a major success.

It was a success in London, but was a flop on Broadway, only running for 100 performances, as well as losing $10 million for its producer, Rosie O'Donnell.\n\n==== 2006 ====\n\nIn 2006, original members Craig and Moss tried to launch a new tour with another lead singer, as George and Hay had declined to tour. Early that year, the band's record company placed an ad for a lead singer to \"...take part in a 2007 World Tour and TV Series.\" The new singer, Sam Butcher was selected because of his own personality, \"not a Boy George lookalike.\" After watching a video on MySpace, George described the singer who replaced him as \"terrible\" and \"dreadful\". George said: \"I wanted to like it but I couldn't.

A new picture of the four members was also posted on the band's official website, along with the list of the 11 UK concert dates.\n\nThe band travelled to Spain for a two-week recording session. 18 new tracks were completed for a new album produced by [[Youth (producer)|Youth]]. The new album, entitled ''Tribes'', was scheduled for release in early 2015 on the band's own label Different Man Music (via [[Kobalt Label Services]]). At the end of that year the album had still not materialised.\n\nOn 19 July 2014, the band were among the line-up for a two-hour concert in [[Edinburgh Castle]], ahead of the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in [[Glasgow]]. Hay did not perform with the band because he was in recovery after having knee surgery. The band played two songs, \"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\" and \"Karma Chameleon\" which were shown on BBC TV.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/taXIx80tzeU Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180307205149/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taXIx80tzeU&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taXIx80tzeU| title = HD Culture Club Live on the BBC Edinburgh Castle Show | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-November 2014, two days before the start of their 21-date US and UK tour, Culture Club announced they had to cancel the tour due to George suffering from a serious throat condition.
