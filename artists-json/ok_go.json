The band is composed of [[Damian Kulash]] ([[lead vocals]], [[rhythm guitar|guitar]]), Tim Nordwind ([[bass guitar]] and [[backing vocalist|vocals]]), Dan Konopka ([[Drum kit|drums]] and [[percussion]]), and [[Andy Ross]] ([[lead guitar|guitar]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and vocals), who joined them in 2005, replacing Andy Duncan. The band is known for its quirky and elaborate music videos which are often filmed in one take.\n\nThe original members formed as OK Go in 1998 and released two studio albums before Duncan's departure. The band's video for \"[[Here It Goes Again]]\" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video]] in 2007.\n\n==History==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:OK Go at WWDC 2010.JPG|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n9hRrUsQ5w OK Go - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?], 15:52, [[Diffuser.fm]]<ref name=\"forf\">{{cite web | title =OK GO PLAY 'WIKIPEDIA: FACT OR FICTION?' | publisher =[[Diffuser.fm]] | date = October 28, 2014 | url =http://diffuser.fm/ok-go-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/ | access-date =September 29, 2015 }}</ref> }}\n\n===Formation and early years (1998\u20132000)===\nThe band's lead singer, [[Damian Kulash]], met bassist Tim Nordwind at [[Interlochen Arts Camp]] near [[Traverse City, Michigan]], when they were 11.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Silver|first=Curtis|date=February 27, 2012|title=Video Visionaries OK Go: Innovation Fueled by Creative Collaboration|magazine=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/02/ok-go-creative-collaboration/|access-date=September 10, 2020|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> The band name comes from an inside joke developed at Interlochen; they had an often [[Substance intoxication|high]] art teacher who would repeatedly say, \"OK...
