Petrozza and Reil are the only two original members left in Kreator, although the latter took a break from the band from 1994 to 1996.

The original lineup featured lead vocalist/guitarist [[Mille Petrozza]], drummer [[J\u00fcrgen Reil|J\u00fcrgen \"Ventor\" Reil]], and bassist Rob Fioretti. Kreator recorded their debut album, ''[[Endless Pain]]'' (1985), in just ten days. The band hired the late [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] guitarist Michael Wulf for the album's tour to play lead, while Petrozza switched to rhythm guitar.\n\nWulf was in the band for a few days but never on the band's second album, ''[[Pleasure to Kill]]'' (1986), which is widely considered a thrash classic<ref name=\"Sorted MagAZine\">{{cite web|title=Sorted MagAZine - Review of ''Pleasure to Kill''|author=Ken Blackmore|publisher=Sorted MagAZine|url=http://sortedmagazine.com/Distorted.php3?nID=354|access-date=26 March 2007}}</ref><ref name=HailMetal.com>{{cite web|title=HailMetal.com - HailMetal.com's Top 50 Thrash Albums of All Time|website=HailMetal.com|url=http://www.hailmetal.com/gate.html?name=BestOfThrash|access-date=26 March 2007|year=2006}}</ref><ref name=\"All Music Guide\"/> and a big influence on the [[death metal]] genre.<ref>{{cite web |title=CD Gallery - Kreator |url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/kreator.htm |publisher=No Life 'til Metal |access-date=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"history\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://invisibleoranges.com/interviews/cannibalcorpse.html |title=Interview with Cannibal Corpse |publisher=[[Invisible Oranges]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703180313/http://invisibleoranges.com/interviews/cannibalcorpse.html |archive-date=3 July 2007 |access-date=7 December 2011}}</ref> It would not be until 31 years after its release that ''Pleasure to Kill'' entered the German album charts.<ref name=\"GER\"/> Produced by [[Harris Johns]] ([[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Helloween]], [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]]), the album showed the band growing in talent and technical ability.

The band started their first tour ever (before the release of ''Pleasure to Kill'', they had only played five gigs total); they played their first shows outside of Germany in the fall of 1986, supporting bands like [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] and [[Celtic Frost]], and in the spring of 1987, they toured the US for the first time, opening for [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]] on their ''[[Killing Technology]]'' tour.<ref name=\"metallipromo\">{{cite web|url=http://metallipromo.com/kr.html|title=Kreator Tour Dates|work=metallipromo.com|access-date=11 December 2020}}</ref> Kreator's first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Flag of Hate]]'', was also released in 1986, and around this time, J\u00f6rg \"Tritze\" Trzebiatowski had joined the band.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}\n\n===Rising popularity (1987\u20131991)===\nIn 1987, Kreator released their third studio album, ''[[Terrible Certainty]]'', which is often considered a high-quality Kreator album as the arrangements on the album were more complex and the tempos more varied.<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|title=AllMusic - Review of ''Terrible Certainty'' |author=Vincent Jeffries |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=terrible-certainty-mw0000199537|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=26 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2F%23%2Fartist%2FRihanna%2Fchart-history%2F658897%3Ff%3D793%26g%3DSingles&date=2011-10-02 |archive-date= 2 October 2011 }}</ref> The album featured another hit \"Behind the Mirror\", and the band's popularity continued to grow and a video for \"Toxic Trace\" was created for MTV play. They managed to find enough time and money (coming from the concerts) to finance another EP, ''[[Out of the Dark... Into the Light]]''. By this point, Kreator had already graduated to headlining their own tours, as well as playing at theaters and arenas with bands such as [[Megadeth]], [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]] and Holy Terror.<ref name=\"metallipromo\" />\n\nBerlin based [[independent record label]] [[Noise Records]] licensed Kreator for the territories outside of Europe and Japan to the major label [[Epic Records]] in 1988.

Tritze left Kreator after ''Extreme Aggression''. In 1990, with new guitarist [[Frank Blackfire|Frank \"Blackfire\" Gosdzik]] (also formerly of [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]]), the band released their fifth studio album ''[[Coma of Souls]]'', again produced by Burns. The album was not quite as praised as the band's previous few albums (many felt the album was \"rushed\" and repetitive),<ref name=\"All Music Guide\"/> but still managed sell and maintain popularity quite well, with the singles \"When the Sun Burns Red\" and \"People of the Lie\" becoming hits.\n\n===Experimentation (1992\u20132000)===\nThe early 1990s brought a decline in the popularity of traditional thrash metal. With many other thrash bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] changing their style by incorporating more melodic elements into their compositions, Kreator began experimenting with [[groove metal]] and [[industrial metal]] around this time.\n\nThe result was ''[[Renewal (album)|Renewal]]'', released in 1992, which featured heavy death metal and industrial influences. While reaching a newer audience, the band upset many longtime fans, accusing them of \"[[selling out]]\".<ref name=\"UTTER DARK webzine\">{{cite web|title=UTTER DARK webzine \u2013 Kreator interview|author=Bertrand Garnier|publisher=UTTER DARK webzine|url=http://utterdark.free.fr/kreator1.htm|access-date=27 March 2007|date=29 February 2000}}</ref><ref name=\"Extreem Metaal\"/> The band experienced a decline in popularity as the result of the backlash against the album.\n\nThe line-up of the band underwent significant changes too. Founding member Roberto Fioretti left the band after the recording of the album and was replaced by Andreas Herz. In 1994, Reil left as well, leaving Petrozza the sole original band member. Reil was replaced by Joe Cangelosi while Herz left the same year and was replaced by [[Christian Giesler]]. During this time \"Epic Records\" dropped the band from the contract making them enter into an agreement with [[GUN Records]]. The new lineup released the album ''[[Cause for Conflict]]'' the same year. The songs bore a heavy influence of such bands as [[Pantera]] and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] as well as the partial resemblance of \"Renewal\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nGosdzik and Cangelosi left in 1996 and were replaced by Tommy Vetterli (formerly of [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]]). This new line-up saw Reil return. Kreator continued to experiment producing ''[[Outcast (Kreator album)|Outcast]]'' and ''[[Endorama]]'', with [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[gothic rock|gothic]] influences, incorporated [[sampling (music)|samples]] and [[loop (music)|loops]]. Petrozza employed different approaches for singing, and the albums retained the [[groove metal]] influences. However, the record sales went down and by the end of the 1990s the band reached commercial and critical nadir. Despite that, Mille Petrozza was quoted stating: ''\"For us, success doesn't define in record sales. So all our albums have been successful for us, because we've achieved what we were aiming for...\"''.<ref name=\"Extreem Metaal\">{{cite web|title=Extreem Metaal - Kreator|publisher=Extreem Metaal|url=http://www.extreemmetaal.nl/interviews/interviews/kreator_duitsland.html|access-date=27 March 2007|date=21 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301095851/http://www.extreemmetaal.nl/interviews/interviews/kreator_duitsland.html|archive-date=1 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Return in style (2001\u20132009)===\n[[File:Kreator by Christian Misje.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Kreator performing live at [[Hole in the Sky (festival)|Hole in the Sky]] in 2007]]\nIn 2001, with new lead guitarist [[Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6]], Kreator released their \"comeback\" album ''[[Violent Revolution]]'', which saw the band returning to their classic thrash metal style.
