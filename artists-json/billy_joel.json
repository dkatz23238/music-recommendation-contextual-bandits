Growing up, he took piano lessons at his mother's insistence. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[The Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of the song \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in [[Philadelphia]], prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', in 1973. After ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', in 1977. This album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\"; another song on this album, \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\", is Joel's favorite of his own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315| title= Joel on 'Scenes': I couldn't do a show without it| website= Newsday| language= en| access-date= June 6, 2019| archive-date= June 7, 2019| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190607003406/https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', was released in 1978 and became his first album to peak at No.1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock artist; this release featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". His next album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'', was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'', released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; this release featured \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", three of his best-known songs. After ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth studio album, ''[[River of Dreams]]'', in 1993. He went on to release ''[[Fantasies and Delusions]]'', a 2001 album featuring classical compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] [[animated film]] ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', in which he played the character Dodger with his song, \"Why Should I Worry?\", and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]''.\n\nAcross the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 self-penned Top 40 hits in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |title=Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=July 19, 2018 |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612164420/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |url-status=live }}</ref> three of which (\"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\", \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") reached the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts.

In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \"shreds\" his [[vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, \"[[New York State of Mind]]\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''.

Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time.

It was recorded at larger US arenas and in intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over 3 million copies.

The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=September 12, 2012 |archive-date=August 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828050638/http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release. The music video of the song, originally written about then girlfriend [[Elle MacPherson]], featured future wife [[Christie Brinkley]] as a high society girl, whose car pulls into the gas station where Joel's character is working. At the end of the video, Joel's \"grease monkey\" character drives off with his \"uptown girl\" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsC_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT214| title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics| first1=Michael| last1=Heatley| first2=Frank| last2=Hopkinson| date=November 24, 2014| publisher=Pavilion Books| access-date=January 28, 2017| via=Google Books| isbn=978-1909396883}}</ref>\n\nIn December, the title song, \"[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]\", was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, \"[[The Longest Time]]\" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, \"[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Christie Brinkley also plays the \"redhead girl in a Chevrolet\". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.\n\nJoel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] \"[[We Are the World]]\" project in 1985.\n\nFollowing the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]\" and \"[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"[[A Matter of Trust]]\" and \"[[Modern Woman]]\" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad \"[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]\" also charted, peaking at No. 18.\n\nOn November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song \"[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]\" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\".\n\n''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.\n\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura |last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]].

Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===\n[[File:Billy Joel 1994.jpg|thumb|Joel in 1994]]\n[[File:Billy Joel with guitar 1994.jpg|thumb|upright|Joel playing guitar in 1994|left]]\nThe Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare [[voice acting]] role, as the character Dodger, a sarcastic [[Jack Russell Terrier|Jack Russell]] based on the [[Artful Dodger]]. The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\n\nThe recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |access-date=August 19, 2011 |archive-date=September 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918190851/http://classicbands.com/joel.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe first single for the album, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third \u2013 and most recent \u2013 US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].\n\n''Storm Front''{{'s}} second single, \"[[I Go to Extremes]]\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"[[The Downeaster Alexa]]\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"[[And So It Goes]]\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |access-date=August 19, 2011 |archive-date=November 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128114750/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |url-status=live }}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |access-date=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archive-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard''{{'s}} Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"[[All About Soul]]\" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and \"[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]\", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).\n\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n===1994\u2013present: Touring===\n[[File:BILLY7.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 1995]]\n[[File:PSX 20190119 094326.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006]]\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel wrote and recorded the song \"Shameless\" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'s}} country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, \"[[Baby Grand]]\" (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\" and \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.\n\nIn 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"[[Your Song]]\" with [[Elton John]].\n\nIn 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"[[Until the Night]]\" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.\n\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like \"Zanzibar\" and \"[[All for Leyna]]\". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 48 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.\n\nJoel visited the United Kingdom and Ireland for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour.

The track was dedicated to servicemen based in Iraq. Joel wrote it in September 2007 after reading numerous letters sent to him from American soldiers in Iraq. \"Christmas in Fallujah\" is only the second pop/rock song released by Joel since 1993's ''River of Dreams''. Proceeds from the song benefited the Homes For Our Troops foundation.\n\nOn January 26, 2008, Joel performed with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] celebrating the 151st anniversary of the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]].

His mood was light, and joke-filled, even introducing himself as \"Billy Joel's dad\" and stating \"you guys overpaid to see a fat bald guy\". He also admitted that Canadian folk-pop musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]] was the musical inspiration for \"She's Always A Woman\".<ref>{{cite news| work= [[The Windsor Star]]| title= Billy Joel (notes)| date= June 20, 2008}}</ref>{{failed verification| date= October 2012}}\n\nOn July 16 and 18, 2008, Joel played the final concerts at [[Shea Stadium]] before its demolition.
