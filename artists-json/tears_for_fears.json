Around this time they met local musician [[Ian Stanley]], who offered them free use of his home [[Multitrack recording|8-track studio]]. Stanley began working with the duo as their keyboard-player and, after recording two demos, Tears for Fears were signed to [[Phonogram Records]] in the UK in 1981 by [[Artists and repertoire|A&R manager]] Dave Bates. Their first single, \"[[Suffer the Children (song)|Suffer the Children]]\", produced by [[David Lord (producer)|David Lord]], was released on that label in November 1981, followed by the first edition of \"Pale Shelter\" (produced by [[Mike Howlett]]) in March 1982, but neither release was successful.\n\n===''The Hurting'' and first international successes (1982\u20131983)===\nThe band achieved their first taste of success with their third single, \"[[Mad World]]\", which reached No. 3 in the UK in November 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title= Official Singles Chart Top 75: 31 October 1982 \u2013 06 November 1982 |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |access-date= 11 May 2015 |url= http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19821031/7501}}</ref> Their first album, ''[[The Hurting]]'', was released in March 1983. For this album (and the next), [[keyboardist]] and composer [[Ian Stanley]] and drummer [[Manny Elias]] were considered full band members, though Smith and Orzabal were still essentially the frontmen and public face[s] of the band.\n\nThe album, produced by [[Chris Hughes (record producer)|Chris Hughes]] and Ross Cullum, showcased guitar- and synthesizer-based songs with lyrics reflecting Orzabal's bitter childhood and his interest in [[primal therapy]].<ref name=\"Noisey\"/> The album was a big success and had a lengthy chart run (65 weeks) in the UK, where it reached No. 1 and platinum status. It also reached the top 20 in several other countries and yielded the international hit singles \"[[Mad World]]\" (top 5 hit in South Africa), \"[[Change (Tears for Fears song)|Change]]\" (top 40 hit in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the [[Netherlands]], Poland and South Africa \u2013 their first single to reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]), and a re-recorded version of \"[[Pale Shelter]]\". All three of these singles reached the Top 5 in the UK.\n\nTowards the end of 1983, the band released a new, slightly more experimental single, \"[[The Way You Are (Tears for Fears song)|The Way You Are]]\", intended as a stopgap while they worked on their second album. The single was a top-30 hit in the UK, but did not come close to matching the success of their three previous hits, despite a national [[Concert|concert tour]] in December of that year (captured on the ''[[In My Mind's Eye]]'' live video release). The single, which heavily featured sampling and programmed rhythms, was a departure from Tears for Fears' previous musical approach. In the liner notes to their 1996 [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] compilation album ''[[Saturnine Martial & Lunatic]]'' they wrote \"this was the point we realised we had to change direction\", though the somewhat experimental style of the single continued to be reflected in their forthcoming B-sides.\n\n===''Songs from the Big Chair'' and worldwide fame (1984\u20131986)===\nIn early 1984, they began working with a new producer, Jeremy Green, on their new single \"[[Mothers Talk]]\". However, the band were ultimately unhappy with the results and so producer Chris Hughes was brought back into the fold and the \"Mothers Talk\" single re-produced for release in August 1984. A departure from their earlier works, the single became a top-20 hit in the UK, but it was the follow-up single \"[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]\" (released in the UK in November 1984) that was the real beginning of the band's international fame.\n\n\"Shout\", a top-5 UK hit, paved the way for their second album, ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (released in February 1985), which entered the UK album chart at No. 2 and remained in the upper reaches of the chart for the next 12 months. They did away with the predominantly synthpop feel of the first album, instead expanding into a more sophisticated sound that would become the band's stylistic hallmark. Anchored on the creative hub of Orzabal, Stanley and producer Hughes, the new Tears for Fears sound helped to propel ''Songs from the Big Chair'' into becoming one of the year's biggest sellers worldwide, eventually being certified triple platinum in the UK and quintuple platinum in the US (where it remained the No. 1 album for five weeks in the summer of 1985).<ref>{{cite web|title= Tears for Fears \u2013 Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= 19 January 2014 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tears-for-fears-mn0000019892/awards}}</ref>\n\nThe album's title was inspired by the book and [[Miniseries|television miniseries]] ''[[Sybil (1976 film)|Sybil]]'', the chronicle of a woman with [[dissociative identity disorder]] who sought refuge in her analyst's \"big chair\", Orzabal and Smith stating they felt each of the album's songs had a distinctive personality of its own. The band had also recorded a track titled \"The Big Chair\", which was released as the B-side to \"Shout\" but was not included on the album.\n\nThe album's success came in conjunction with the array of hit singles it yielded: \"Mothers Talk\" (re-recorded yet again for its US release in 1986), \"[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]\" (No. 4 UK, No. 1 in the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, [[Switzerland]] and a huge hit in other territories), \"[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]\" (their highest-charting UK and Irish hit at No. 2 and another No. 1 in the US and in Canada), \"[[Head over Heels (Tears for Fears song)|Head over Heels]]\" (UK No. 12, US No. 3, Ireland No. 5, Canada No. 8), and \"[[I Believe (Tears for Fears song)|I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)]]\" (UK No. 23 and Ireland No. 10).<ref>{{cite news|first= Bo. |last= Emerson |title= Tears for Fears: Dynamic Duo Keeps Lucky Streak Alive |date= 9 February 1990 |newspaper= [[Ottawa Citizen]] |page= D3}}</ref> Some regions even saw the release of [[Special edition|limited edition]] 10\" singles for these hits, and a variety of double packs and picture discs in addition to the regular 7\" and 12\" formats.\n\nFollowing the album's release, the band went on a world tour that lasted most of the year, playing notably at the ''Montreux Golden Rose Rock and Pop Festival'' in May 1985.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Heather |last= Johnson |title= Classic Tracks: Tears for Fears' \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" |magazine= [[Mix (magazine)|Mix]] |date= 8 January 2007 |url= https://www.mixonline.com/recording/classic-tracks-tears-fears-everybody-wants-rule-world-365857}}</ref> In September 1985, the band performed \"Shout\" at the [[1985 MTV Video Music Awards]] at the [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|title= MTV Video Music Awards \u2013 Performers |publisher= [[MTV]] |access-date= 4 December 2011 |url= http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/archive/performers.jhtml}}</ref> Also during the tour, Orzabal and Smith discovered an American female singer/pianist, [[Oleta Adams]], who was performing in a [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] hotel bar, and whom they invited to collaborate on their next album. Towards the end of the year, they released a video collection/documentary titled ''[[Scenes from the Big Chair]]''.\n\nIn February 1986, having completed the lengthy and exhausting Big Chair world tour, Tears for Fears were honoured at the [[List of BRIT Awards ceremonies#1986|1986 Brit Awards]] in London, where they won the Best British Single award for \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\".<ref name=\"BPI\">{{cite web|title= Brit Awards 1986 Winners |publisher= Brit Awards |access-date= 15 May 2011 |url= http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1986}}</ref> The band was also nominated for Best British Group and Best British Album, and Chris Hughes was nominated for Best Producer.<ref name=\"BPI\"/> The band performed the song at the ceremony, which became the final public performance of drummer Manny Elias who left the group shortly afterwards.\n\nThe same year, Orzabal and Stanley worked together on a side project named Mancrab and released a single, \"Fish for Life\", which was written for the soundtrack of the film ''[[The Karate Kid, Part II]]''. The track was written and produced by Orzabal and Stanley, and featured vocals by US singer/dancer Eddie Thomas, who was one of the dancers in the video for \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\".\n\n====Live Aid====\nOn 13 July 1985, Tears for Fears were scheduled to perform at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium|JFK Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]] for the [[Live Aid]] charity event. However, on the morning of the historic event, it was announced that the band (who had actually been billed to appear at the event before they had even agreed to do so) had pulled out of the show. They were replaced by blues rock group [[George Thorogood#The Destroyers|George Thorogood and the Destroyers]], which had a strong Philadelphia-area following. The official reason given for their non-appearance was that two of their backing musicians, guitarist [[Electric Guitars|Andrew Sanders]] and saxophonist [[Will Gregory]], had quit due to the expiration of their contract; they were replaced by Alan Griffiths on guitar and Josephine Wells on saxophone for the remaining bulk of the 1985 world tour. In place of appearing, the band pledged to donate proceeds from their concerts played in Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York.<ref>{{cite news|first= Damian |last= Corless |title= Calling out around the world...

Sport Aid's slogan was \"I Ran the World\", therefore Tears for Fears released \"[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World#Covers and re-releases|Everybody Wants to Run the World]]\" (No. 5 in the UK and No. 4 in Ireland). Indirectly, the band were involved in the earlier Band Aid single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" from 1984, which featured a slowed down [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from their song \"The Hurting\" (from their [[The Hurting|debut album of the same name]]) in the introduction.\n\n===''The Seeds of Love'' (1987\u20131990)===\nIt was 1989 before the group released their third album, ''[[The Seeds of Love]]'' (on which Ian Stanley appeared for the last time as a member of Tears for Fears), at a reported production cost of over a million pounds.<ref>{{cite news|first= Stephen |last= Humphries |title= Singer sheds Tears for Fears |newspaper= [[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date= 9 November 2001 |url= https://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1109/p20s2-almp.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Fred |last= Shuster |title= Tears Leader has no Fears Exploring the Past |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Daily News]] |via= [[HighBeam Research]] |date= 8 December 1995 |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25029124.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 24 September 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924191526/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25029124.html}}</ref> The album was written largely by Orzabal along with keyboardist [[Nicky Holland]], who had toured with the band on their \"Big Chair\" world tour in 1985. Moving from various studios and using various sets of producers over many months, the band ultimately decided to scrap the recordings and take the reins themselves with assistance from engineer Dave Bascombe. Much of the material was recorded in jam sessions and later edited down.

The split was blamed on Orzabal's perfectionist approach to production and delays caused by Smith's jetsetting lifestyle and desire to slow down the pace of their work (Smith was also going through a divorce at the time).<ref>{{cite web|first= Felix |last= Behr |title= This Is Why Tears for Fears Broke Up in the 90s |website= Grunge.com |date= 14 August 2020 |access-date= 10 June 2021 |url= https://www.grunge.com/236824/this-is-why-tears-for-fears-broke-up-in-the-90s/}}</ref> Another factor in the break-up was the band's manager, Paul King, who declared bankruptcy in 1990 and was later convicted of fraud in 2004.<ref name=\"JD\"/><ref>{{cite web|title= Ex-Tears For Fears Manager Jailed |date= 10 May 2004 |publisher= Music News |access-date= 26 August 2012 |url= http://www.music-news.com/shownews.asp?H=Ex-Tears-For-Fears-manager-jailed&nItemID=1353}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Smith's departure, Orzabal kept the band name alive by releasing the 1992 hit single \"[[Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)]]\". The single was released to promote the band's greatest hits collection ''[[Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82\u201392)]]'', which featured every single to reach the Top 20, either in the UK or internationally, apart from the Sport Aid fundraiser. The album peaked at no. 2 in the UK, where it was certified double platinum, and also reached the Top 10 in several other countries, including France, Italy and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|title= Tears For Fears \u2013 Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82\u201392) |website= Charts.org.nz |access-date= 7 November 2019 |url= https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=Tears+For+Fears&titel=Tears+Roll+Down+%28Greatest+Hits+82%2D92%29&cat=a}}</ref>\n\n===Solo era: ''Elemental'' and ''Raoul and the Kings of Spain'' (1993\u20131996)===\nIn 1993, Orzabal (still under the name Tears for Fears) released the album ''[[Elemental (Tears for Fears album)|Elemental]]'' together with longtime collaborator Alan Griffiths. Co-produced by [[Tim Palmer]], it yielded the international hit \"[[Break It Down Again]]\" (top 20 in the UK, Canada, France, and Italy) and was supported with another successful world tour, including a college tour of the US where \"Break It Down Again\" reached no. 25. Although it charted considerably lower in the US than the previous two studio albums (no. 45), it still earned a Gold disc there for sales of over half a million copies.\n\nOrzabal, still working with Griffiths and Palmer, released another Tears for Fears album, ''[[Raoul and the Kings of Spain]]'', in 1995. This album was a more contemplative work that delved into his own Spanish heritage and showcased a new [[Latin American music|Latin]] musical influence (Raoul was originally the name Orzabal's parents wanted to give him, and is also the name of his own first son). The album was not a commercial success by Tears for Fears standards, though minor chart success came via the single release of the title track (top 40 in the UK) and (to a lesser extent) the single \"[[God's Mistake]]\".\n\nIn 1996 a B-sides compilation album, ''[[Saturnine Martial & Lunatic]]'', was released on Mercury, which included B-sides and some rare tracks from the successful 1982\u201393 period.\n\n===Reunion: ''Everybody Loves a Happy Ending''===\nIn 2000, routine paperwork obligations led the duo to re-establish contact with each other after Orzabal signed a business document on Smith's behalf.<ref>{{cite news|first= Aidin |last= Vaziri |title= Pop Quiz: Roland Orzabal of Tears For Fears |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= 19 September 2004 |access-date= 15 August 2010 |url= http://www.sfgate.com/music/popquiz/article/POP-QUIZ-ROLAND-ORZABAL-OF-TEARS-FOR-FEARS-2724224.php}}</ref> Smith flew back to England (where Orzabal still lived) and they had dinner and decided to work on a new album together.<ref>{{cite news|first= Steve |last= Morse |title= Tears for Fears' New Disc is Back on the Right Track |newspaper= [[The Boston Globe]] |via= HighBeam Research |date= 20 August 1993 |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8241625.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 24 September 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201002/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8241625.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Rick |last= de Yampert |title= Tears for Fears Brings Tears of Joy |newspaper= [[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]] |date= 1 October 2004 |page= 10E}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= The KPCS Archive \u00bb 08 (1) \u2013 Curt Smith |website= Kevinpollakschatshow.com |access-date= 15 May 2011 |url= http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/archive/?cat=70 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713144717/http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/archive/?cat=70 |archive-date= 13 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe songwriting sessions included Charlton Pettus (Smith's collaborator since the mid-1990s), and 14 songs were written and recorded in less than six months. The ensuing album, ''[[Everybody Loves a Happy Ending]]'', was released in September 2004. Two U.S. tours followed, and the 2004 tour included an unrehearsed guest appearance by [[Oleta Adams]] at the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] show for a performance of \"Woman in Chains\".\n\n''Everybody Loves a Happy Ending'' was released in the UK and Europe in March 2005 on [[Gut Records]], shortly after the comeback single \"Closest Thing to Heaven\" became the first Tears for Fears [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40]] hit in a decade. The promo video for the single was a colourful fantasy that featured Hollywood actress [[Brittany Murphy]] riding in a [[hot air balloon]]. The European releases of the album contained all fourteen tracks recorded during the recording sessions, while the US version only contained twelve. A brief tour of larger UK venues followed in April.\n\nA live performance at the [[Parc des Princes]] stadium in Paris, recorded in June 2005, was released on CD and DVD in France and [[Benelux]]. Titled ''[[Secret World Live in Paris|Secret World \u2013 Live in Paris]]'', it was released on the [[XIII Bis Records|XIII Bis]] label in early 2006 and became a best-seller, with over 70,000 physical copies sold in addition to downloads. The CD contained a new studio song, \"Floating Down the River\", and a remastered Curt Smith/Mayfield track, \"What Are We Fighting For?\".\n[[File:Tears for Fears 2008.jpg|thumb|Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith in 2008.]]\n\nDuring this period, \"Mad World\" was re-recorded by [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]] and [[Gary Jules]] for the soundtrack of the 2001's film ''[[Donnie Darko]]''; a 2003 single release of the song reached number one in the UK for three consecutive weeks<ref>{{cite web|title= Gary Jules |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |access-date= 3 May 2022 |url= https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/2335/gary-jules/}}</ref> and won Orzabal his second [[Ivor Novello Award]].<ref>{{cite news|title= The Darkness scoop Ivor Novello award |newspaper= East Anglian Daily Times |date= 28 May 2004 |access-date= 3 May 2022 |url= http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/the_darkness_scoop_ivor_novello_award_1_64997}}</ref> This version also reached the Top 40 in numerous other countries between 2003 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title= Michael Andrews feat.
