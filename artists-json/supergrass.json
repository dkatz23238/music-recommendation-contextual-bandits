For the majority of the band's tenure, the line-up consisted of brothers [[Gaz Coombes|Gaz]] (lead vocals, guitar) and [[Rob Coombes]] (keyboards), [[Mick Quinn]] (bass, backing vocals) and [[Danny Goffey]] (drums, backing vocals). Originally a three-piece, Rob Coombes officially joined the band in 2002. \n\nThe band signed to [[Parlophone Records]] in 1994 and produced ''[[I Should Coco]]'' (1995), the best-selling debut album for the label since [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Please Please Me]]''. Their first album's fourth single, \"[[Alright (Supergrass song)|Alright]]\", was an international hit. The band went on to release five albums: ''[[In It for the Money]]'' (1997), ''[[Supergrass (album)|Supergrass]]'' (1999), ''[[Life on Other Planets]]'' (2002), ''[[Road to Rouen]]'' (2005) and ''[[Diamond Hoo Ha]]'' (2008), as well as a compilation called ''[[Supergrass Is 10]]'' (2004).\n\nIn August 2009 the band signed to [[Cooking Vinyl]] and began work on their seventh studio album, ''Release the Drones''. The album remains unreleased and unfinished. On 12 April 2010, the band announced that they were splitting up due to musical and creative differences.<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hz8lc5932FrCu_TgExj8M9_iqDcA ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416161425/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hz8lc5932FrCu_TgExj8M9_iqDcA |date=16 April 2010 }}</ref> The group disbanded after four farewell gigs, the final one at [[La Cigale]], Paris, on 11 June 2010.<ref name=\"bbc_newsbeat_1\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10070000/newsid_10079400/10079438.stm |title=BBC Newsbeat: Supergrass Split |work=BBC News |date=12 April 2010 |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe band reformed in 2019, initially to perform at Pilton Party followed by a \"secret\" gig at Oslo in Hackney, London.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/pilton-party-2019-supergrass-guests-3289816|title=The 'big band' reforming for Pilton Party 2019|first=Alexander|last=Brock|date=6 September 2019|website=Bristolpost}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thefestivals.uk/glastonbury-supergrass/|title=Glastonbury: Supergrass have reformed to play Pilton Party tonight|first=Sam|last=Warrenger|website=Thefestivals.uk|date=6 September 2019}}</ref> The band made their final appearance of their reunion with a performance in honour of [[Foo Fighters]]' recently deceased drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] at his tribute concert, performing some of Hawkins' favourite songs from Supergrass's catalogue.

The band played gigs at various venues around Oxfordshire, often [[public house]]s and clubs. One pub the band played at was the [[Jericho Tavern]] in [[Oxford]].\n\nThey sold a demo tape recorded and produced by Nick Langston at Stargoat Studios near [[Banbury]]. The demo featured three songs \u2013 \"Flying\" which featured a 20-second countdown at the beginning, the recording of a rocket launch and then a fast guitar-based song which appeared influenced by [[the Stone Roses]], the second song, \"Inside Of Me\" was similar in style but changed to a slower, almost funk jam at the end, the third song simply titled on the tape \"(Slow Song)\" was a guitar-based ballad. The band enjoyed enough success to release one single in 1992, \"Just Got Back Today\" on [[Nude Records]], which is now a highly sought after rarity. Second single, \"Tightrope\" was never released due to disagreements with Nude Records (but does appear on compilation CD 'Days Spent Dreaming'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strangeones.co.uk/music/45_j1.htm |title=The Strange Ones Supergrass Site |publisher=Strangeones.co.uk |date=20 July 1992 |access-date=21 October 2015}}</ref>), the band split up soon after this in the fall of 1992.

The promo video, produced in conjunction with the [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], featured the band with comical \"[[muppet]]\" bodies. The single generated welcome publicity following their time out of the limelight, as did a small sold-out tour scheduled around the single release, the final night of which was at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] as part of [[MTV]]'s \"Five Night Stand\" festival. The single and the tour were followed by their third LP ''[[Supergrass (album)|Supergrass]]'' (1999). The following spring the record was released in the US Once more, the album was recorded at Sawmills Studio with longtime associate Cornfield producing. ''Supergrass'' was well received critically and commercially and it has since gone platinum in the UK, but did not reap the same level of success as its predecessors. Critics claimed the album was \"hit and miss\", which showed up particularly as the \"also-rans are surrounded by songs that are as great as anything Supergrass has ever recorded\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Supergrass/Discography/album/P142415/R443374/ |title=Supergrass Supergrass |publisher=Starpulse.com |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> Their next single, \"[[Moving (Supergrass song)|Moving]]\", proved popular and reached the Top Ten in the UK.

The album was released in the UK on Parlophone, but in the US on the [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|Island Def Jam]] imprint. The record was not as commercially successful as Supergrass's first three albums, failing to make the Top Three in the UK albums chart. However, the critical response to the album was generally very positive, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] claiming \"The world is a better place for having Supergrass in it.\".<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r606992|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Life on Other Planets > Overview )))]</ref> It has since gone gold in the UK. ''Life on Other Planets'' was also notable as it was the first Supergrass album to recognise Rob Coombes as an official member. For the band's first three albums, Supergrass officially consisted of Gaz Coombes, Goffey and Quinn although Rob Coombes contributed to many of the band's songs and videos, and toured with them. Tracks recorded before this were often credited to \"Supergrass and Rob Coombes\". The band followed ''Life on Other Planets'' with another extended three-year hiatus, devoted to touring and personal engagements.\n\nIn June 2004 the band's record company suggested the band release a singles compilation ''[[Supergrass Is 10]]'', spawning two new self-produced tracks: \"[[Kiss of Life (Supergrass song)|Kiss of Life]]\" and \"Bullet\". The companion DVD contained 'Home Movie', a humorous documentary charting the band's first 10 years' achievements, made in collaboration with \"[[Seen the Light]]\" video director [[Simon Hilton]].
