In April, Tennant left ''Smash Hits'' magazine \u2013 where he had progressed to the position of deputy editor \u2013 and in July, a new single, \"[[Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)]]\", was released, reaching number 116 in the UK. The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to this single, \"In the Night\", later resurfaced, in a longer [[remix]]ed version, as the opening track to the duo's first [[remix album]], ''[[Disco (Pet Shop Boys album)|Disco]]'', in 1986.

Released in October 1985 it rose slowly in the British charts to become number one in January 1986. It subsequently replicated this success in the United States, Canada, Finland, Hong Kong, Lebanon, [[Israel]], New Zealand and Norway and sold an estimated 1.5&nbsp;million copies worldwide.\n\nAfter the success of \"West End Girls\", the Pet Shop Boys released a follow-up single, \"[[Love Comes Quickly]]\", on 24 February 1986. The single reached number 19 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and was followed by their debut album, ''[[Please (Pet Shop Boys album)|Please]]'', on 24 March. In June 1986, the band announced a European [[concert tour|tour]]; however, their plans for a theatrical extravaganza proved to be too expensive and the tour was cancelled. ''Please'' started Pet Shop Boys' penchant for choosing one-word album titles, which Neil Tennant has since stated is now a Pet Shop Boys \"signature thing\", akin to [[e.e. cummings]]' use of exclusively lower case letters.<ref>{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Landau |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/07/pet.shop.boys.yes/index.html |title=Pet Shop Boys come back with a lot of 'love, etc.' |publisher=CNN |date=7 April 2009 |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> New versions of their second single, \"[[Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)]]\", and the album track \"[[Suburbia (song)|Suburbia]]\" were also released in 1986, followed by ''Disco''.

Later, on 15 June, they released what became their second number one single, \"[[It's a Sin]]\". The single caused some controversy: Tennant's school, [[St. Cuthbert's High School|St. Cuthbert's Grammar School]], in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], chastised him in the [[News media|press]], while pop impresario [[Jonathan King]] accused them of plagiarising the [[Cat Stevens]] song \"[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]\".

The [[music video|video]] to \"It's a Sin\" also saw their first collaboration with director [[Derek Jarman]].\n\nThe continued success of \"It's a Sin\" was followed by the release of \"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This? (song)|What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\" on 10 August. Co-written with [[Allee Willis]] and also featuring [[Dusty Springfield]] on vocals, the single reached number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Although the [[Duet|duo]] had wanted to release this track on their debut album, they had been unable to track down Springfield and were reluctant to record it with any other female singer, despite their record company's suggestions. Springfield's manager finally contacted them in 1986, following the release of ''[[Please (Pet Shop Boys album)|Please]]'', and towards the end of that year, she travelled to London to record \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" with them. It was the first track to be recorded for the duo's second album. Pet Shop Boys had been told that Springfield was difficult to work with and even that she could no longer sing; however, her performance on the track put any such concerns to rest and they began a collaboration with her, which lasted until the end of the decade. Included on their second album ''[[Actually (album)|Actually]]'', the song became a massive worldwide hit and resurrected Springfield's career, leading to her 1990 album, ''[[Reputation (Dusty Springfield album)|Reputation]]'', on which Pet Shop Boys were major contributing writers and [[record producer|producers]]. This duet was also the start of a series of collaborations with high-profile musicians, going on throughout the band's career.\n\nAlso in August 1987, Pet Shop Boys appeared on ''Love Me Tender'', a UK television programme, on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], commemorating the tenth anniversary of [[Elvis Presley]]'s death.<ref name=\"AOMM\">{{cite news |title=The Story of...

September 1987 saw the release of the duo's second studio album, ''Actually'', followed by the single \"[[Rent (song)|Rent]]\" in October, which reached number 8 in the UK. The final song on the album, \"[[King's Cross (song)|King's Cross]]\" accidentally anticipated the [[King's Cross fire]] at the [[London Underground]] section of the station in November of that year (part of the lyrics read: \"Dead and wounded on either side/You know it's only a matter of time\"). ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper in the UK subsequently tried to get the track released as a [[Charity record|charity single]], but Pet Shop Boys would not allow this.\n\nTowards the end of 1987, Pet Shop Boys started work on an hour-long film that would incorporate the songs from ''Please'' and ''Actually''. Working with director [[Jack Bond (director)|Jack Bond]], the short film grew into a full-scale movie, ''[[It Couldn't Happen Here]]'', starring [[Barbara Windsor]], [[Joss Ackland]] and [[Gareth Hunt]]. The film was eventually released in 1988 to mixed reviews. Footage from the film was also used for the music video to \"Always on My Mind\", now released as a single on 30 November; it became both the duo's third number one single in the UK and the [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one single]] for 1987, beating \"[[Fairytale of New York]]\" by [[The Pogues]] and [[Kirsty MacColl]]. In November 2004, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper placed Pet Shop Boys' version of \"Always on My Mind\" at number two in a list of the fifty greatest cover versions of all time.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/11/20/bmcovercont20.xml&sSheet=/arts/2004/11/20/ixtop.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130121336/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/11/20/bmcovercont20.xml&sSheet=/arts/2004/11/20/ixtop.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=30 November 2005 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=They did it their way | date=20 November 2004 | access-date=15 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n1988 started with another collaboration. Pet Shop Boys wrote and produced the song \"[[I'm Not Scared (song)|I'm Not Scared]]\" for [[Patsy Kensit]]'s band, [[Eighth Wonder (band)|Eighth Wonder]]. The song became her biggest hit single and the Pet Shop Boys included their own extended version of the track on their ''Introspective'' album. March 1988 saw the duo achieve their fourth UK number one single (and their last to date), with a remixed edit of \"[[Heart (Pet Shop Boys song)|Heart]]\", different from the album version. This single version would be included on their first and third [[greatest hits album]]s, ''[[Discography: The Complete Singles Collection]]'' and ''[[Ultimate (Pet Shop Boys album)|Ultimate]]'', whereas the album version would be used for their second [[greatest hits album|retrospective]], the double ''[[PopArt: Pet Shop Boys \u2013 The Hits]]''. The [[music video|video]] to the single, directed by Jack Bond, starred [[Ian McKellen]] as a [[vampire]] who steals Neil Tennant's wife.\n\n===1988\u20131992===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn the 1996 [[BBC Radio 1]] documentary ''About Pet Shop Boys'', Neil Tennant noted that their \"[[Imperial Phase (music)|Imperial Phase]]\" ended in 1988. On 12 September 1988, Pet Shop Boys released a new single, \"[[Domino Dancing]]\", and in the documentary Neil recounts his disappointment when hearing the news that the single had reached number 7 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. He felt that their major success was now over and that it was going to be a challenge to maintain their level of success in the future.\n\nTheir third album, ''[[Introspective (album)|Introspective]]'', was released on {{start date|df=yes|1988|10|10}}. Unusually, this was a six-track album of previously unheard remixes and new tracks in extended form. It was followed by the [[Trevor Horn]]\u2013produced top-five single \"[[Left to My Own Devices]]\", and a cover version of the Sterling Void single \"[[It's Alright (Pet Shop Boys song)|It's Alright]]\", in 1989. 1989 also saw the start of Pet Shop Boys' first [[concert tour|tour]], in which they performed in Hong Kong, Japan, and [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The tour followed the ideas of the extravaganza that could not have been afforded earlier in their careers. [[Derek Jarman]] returned to direct the performance and he provided several films that were projected during the shows.\n\nThe September 1990 single, \"[[So Hard]]\" reached No.4 in the UK and was followed by their fourth studio album, ''[[Behaviour (Pet Shop Boys album)|Behaviour]]'' (1990), which was recorded in [[Munich]] with producer [[Harold Faltermeyer]]. The album was not intended to reflect a dramatic change in mood from their earlier albums; however, it is noticeably subdued. It included the fan favourite \"[[Being Boring]]\", the second single from the album, which only reached No.20 in the UK Singles Chart, their lowest placing at the time. The song was inspired by a quote by [[Zelda Fitzgerald]]: \"...she refused to be bored chiefly because she wasn't boring\", and was widely thought to be a commentary on the AIDS epidemic. The music video was directed by filmmaker [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]]. By this time, the duo had also parted ways with manager Tom Watkins, replacing him with Jill Carrington,<ref name=\"behaviour_2001\">[[Chris Heath|Heath, Chris]] (2001). In ''Behaviour'' [CD liner notes]. London: Pet Shop Boys Partnership</ref> who had previously been marketing director at [[Polydor Records|Polydor]].\n\nIn March 1991, a cover of [[U2]]'s \"[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]\" as a [[List of musical medleys|medley]] with \"[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]\", the 1960s pop song by [[Frankie Valli]]/[[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]], was released as a double-[[A-side and B-side|A-sided]] single with a remix of the album track \"[[How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?]]\" by [[Brothers in Rhythm]]. This was followed by the duo's first world tour. Named ''Performance'', the tour kicked off in Tokyo, on 11 March 1991. The tour also visited the United States, Canada, France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, [[Czechoslovakia]], Austria, [[Hungary]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], Switzerland, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The shows were designed by David Alden and David Fielding, who had designed several sets for the [[Royal Opera House]].\n\nBefore taking a break in 1992, in 1991 the Pet Shop Boys released an 18-track [[greatest hits album|compilation]] called ''[[Discography: The Complete Singles Collection|Discography]]'', which included all of their single releases up until then and two new singles\u2014\"[[DJ Culture]]\" and \"[[Was It Worth It? (Pet Shop Boys song)|Was It Worth It?]]\"\u2014omitting only \"How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?\" (although it did appear on the video companion ''Videography''). While \"DJ Culture\" had some success, \"Was It Worth It?\" became the duo's first single to miss the UK Top 20 since their two Bobby O debut singles.\n\nDuring this period, Pet Shop Boys continued to collaborate with many high-profile musicians. They worked again with [[Dusty Springfield]], on the singles \"[[Nothing Has Been Proved]]\" (which was a song written for their soundtrack for the film ''[[Scandal (1989 film)|Scandal]]'' about the [[Profumo affair|Profumo political scandal]] in Britain) and \"[[In Private]]\". The duo later went on to produce half of the tracks on her 1990 [[solo album|solo]] ''[[Reputation (Dusty Springfield album)|Reputation]]'' album. Pet Shop Boys were also asked to write and produce an album for [[Liza Minnelli]], in 1989. The album, ''[[Results (Liza Minnelli album)|Results]]'', generated four singles, including the hit single \"Losing My Mind\", a cover version of the [[Stephen Sondheim]] song from the 1971 Broadway musical \"Follies\". The duo's own demo of this appeared on their \"[[Jealousy (Pet Shop Boys song)|Jealousy]]\" single as a B-side.\n\nTennant worked with [[Bernard Sumner]] and [[Johnny Marr]] on their first album as [[Electronic (band)|Electronic]], whose first single, \"Getting Away with It\", co-written and co-produced by Tennant, was released on 4 December 1989. In 1991, Lowe also contributed to the Electronic project, contributing the chord sequence to \"The Patience of a Saint\" on their 1991 album. In 1992, Tennant sang lead vocals on the non-album single \"Disappointed\", which was featured on the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Cool World]]''. Pet Shop Boys set up the [[Spaghetti Records]] [[Record label|label]] in 1991. Their most successful release was the soundtrack to the 1992 film ''[[The Crying Game]]'', which featured [[Boy George]] performing [[The Crying Game (song)|the title song]]. The song was produced by Pet Shop Boys and featured Tennant on backing vocals. Other artists on the label included Scottish singer [[David Cicero (singer)|Cicero]], The Ignorants, and [[Masterboy]].\n\nIn 1992, they were the subjects of a ''[[The South Bank Show|South Bank Show]]'' documentary on ITV with contributions from Liza Minnelli, [[Eric Watson (photographer)|Eric Watson]] (photographer and video director), [[Simon Frith]] (music critic), David Alden and David Fielding.\n\n===''Very'', ''Disco 2'': 1993\u20131995===\n\nIn June 1993, Pet Shop Boys re-invented their image and made a strong return to the [[UK Singles Chart]] with \"[[Can You Forgive Her? (song)|Can You Forgive Her?]]\". Taking its title from the [[Anthony Trollope]] [[Can You Forgive Her?|novel of the same name]], the single reached number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, while its iconic music video featured the duo in orange body suits and tall [[dunce cap]]s, in a world of [[computer-generated imagery]]. The theme was continued with the follow-up single, often considered as their signature song, a cover of the [[Village People]] single \"[[Go West (song)|Go West]]\", which reached number 2 in the UK, with another computer-generated music video, this time inspired by the [[Soviet Union]]. The tune was adopted into a [[football chant]] at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]] (which Chris Lowe supports) and is heard at grounds throughout Europe to this day{{when|date=June 2020}}.\n\nThe duo's fifth studio album, ''[[Very (Pet Shop Boys album)|Very]]'', followed on 27 September and is the only Pet Shop Boys album to reach number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was produced by Pet Shop Boys and mixed with additional production by [[Stephen Hague]], who had produced their first album and had subsequently produced records by [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[Erasure]]. The other singles from ''Very'', \"[[I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing]]\", \"[[Liberation (Pet Shop Boys song)|Liberation]]\" and \"[[Yesterday, When I Was Mad]]\", continued the theme of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] videos, peaking with the \"Liberation\" video, which contained almost no real-life elements at all. All these videos were directed by [[Howard Greenhalgh]], who continued to work with Pet Shop Boys well into the next decade. ''Very'' was also released in a limited edition including an entirely new album, ''Relentless'', which was composed of six all-new [[progressive house]] tracks, with a darker tone to the perky ''Very''.\n\nIn 1994, Pet Shop Boys offered to remix fellow [[Parlophone]] act [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s single \"[[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]\"; it was a club hit throughout Europe and started a sporadic trend for Pet Shop Boys to remix other artists' music. Also in 1994, Pet Shop Boys released the 1994 [[Comic Relief]] single, \"Absolutely Fabulous\". The song started when Tennant and Lowe were playing around with [[Sampling (music)|sample]]s from the [[BBC]] [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' in the studio. They wanted to release a single, so approached [[lead actor]]s [[Jennifer Saunders]] and [[Joanna Lumley]] and suggested releasing it as a [[charity record|charity single]]. The single was released under the artist name of 'Absolutely Fabulous' too. Tennant and Lowe do not consider it as a Pet Shop Boys single release and it was not included on their next best-of album. The video to the single featured clips from the sitcom, along with newly recorded footage of Tennant and Lowe with the characters of Edina (Saunders) and Patsy (Lumley).\n\nOn 12 September 1994, Pet Shop Boys released the follow-up to their 1986 [[remix album]] ''[[Disco (Pet Shop Boys album)|Disco]]'', in the form of ''[[Disco 2]]''. The album featured club remixes of the [[Single (music)|singles]] released from ''Very'' and ''Behaviour'', in a continuous [[megamix]] by [[Danny Rampling]]. Then, in October, Pet Shop Boys began their ''Discovery'' tour, which would see them visit areas that they had never performed in before: [[Singapore]], Australia, [[Puerto Rico]], Mexico, [[Colombia]], Chile, [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]]. The following year, a new version of \"Paninaro\", the 1986 [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to \"[[Suburbia (song)|Suburbia]]\", was released to promote the B-sides collection ''[[Alternative (album)|Alternative]]''. The single, called \"[[Paninaro (song)|Paninaro '95]]\", is based on the live version from the ''Discovery'' tour.\n\n===1996\u20132001===\n\n[[File:Petshopboys turku finland 1997a.jpg|thumb|Performing in Turku, Finland in 1997]]\nThe Pet Shop Boys remix of the [[David Bowie]] song \"[[Hallo Spaceboy]]\" featured Tennant on backing vocals and was released in the UK on 19 February 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Bowie \u2013 Hallo Spaceboy|url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Hallo-Spaceboy/release/254007|website=Discogs.com|access-date=13 February 2014|year=2014}}</ref> The Pet Shop Boys then joined Bowie during his performance of the song at the 1996 [[Brit Awards]] ceremony, as well as an appearance on the ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' television program.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/bowie-and-blair-band-together-1319875.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/bowie-and-blair-band-together-1319875.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Bowie and Blair band together |newspaper=The Independent |date=20 February 1996 |access-date=6 August 2011 |location=London |first=John |last=McKie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PSB & David Bowie Top of the Pops|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZSzNc7P3xk| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/kZSzNc7P3xk| archive-date=2021-10-30|via=YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|access-date=13 February 2014|author=covdik|format=Video upload|date=24 February 2009}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nIn April, Pet Shop Boys released the single \"[[Before (song)|Before]]\" which reached number 7 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. That month, [[Tina Turner]] also released her ''[[Wildest Dreams (Tina Turner album)|Wildest Dreams]]'' album, which featured the Pet Shop Boys-produced track \"Confidential\". In August, Pet Shop Boys released a follow-up single, \"[[Se a vida \u00e9 (That's the Way Life Is)]]\", a [[Latin American music]]-inspired track, featuring a drum [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from a track called \"Estrada da paix\u00e3o\" by [[Brazil]]ian act [[Olodum]]. This preceded the sixth Pet Shop Boys album ''[[Bilingual (album)|Bilingual]]'', which was released in September. \n\nThe majority of 1998 was spent with a series of live dates and minor releases, including a charity album of [[No\u00ebl Coward]] songs, called ''[[Twentieth-Century Blues: The Songs of Noel Coward|Twentieth Century Blues]]''. The album included Pet Shop Boys' version of \"Sail Away\", along with songs performed by [[Elton John]], [[Texas (band)|Texas]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]], [[Suede (band)|Suede]], [[Damon Albarn]], [[Vic Reeves]] and [[Robbie Williams]]. Tennant also co-produced the Williams track and provided backing vocals for Elton John. Tennant provided backing vocals on Robbie Williams' \"[[No Regrets (Robbie Williams song)|No Regrets]]\" single, along with [[Neil Hannon]] from The Divine Comedy. Meanwhile, the band switched managers again as Carrington resigned and was succeeded by Mitch Clark, who had previously worked for [[EMI|EMI International]] as Head of Promotion.<ref name=\"a-z\">{{cite web | author=Kenneth, Stephen | url=http://www.sopetshopboys.co.uk/a-z.htm | title=A-Z of PSB | publisher=So Pet Shop Boys | access-date=14 June 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427182723/http://www.sopetshopboys.co.uk/a-z.htm | archive-date=27 April 2006 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Pet Shop Boys began to work with playwright [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]] on a stage musical project. In 1999, many of the tracks recorded ended up on the duo's seventh studio album, ''[[Nightlife (Pet Shop Boys album)|Nightlife]]'', which included the Top 20 singles \"[[I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More]]\" and \"[[New York City Boy]]\", the Top 10 hit \"[[You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk]]\", \"[[Nightlife (Pet Shop Boys album)|Closer to Heaven]]\"\u2014which would later become the title of Pet Shop Boys' musical\u2014as well a duet with [[Kylie Minogue]], \"[[Nightlife (Pet Shop Boys album)|In Denial]]\", about a father coming out to his daughter. Minogue later performed the track live, during her 2005 ''[[Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour|Showgirl]]'' tour, singing to a pre-recorded Neil Tennant. This is not the first time that Pet Shop Boys have worked with Minogue: in 1994, they wrote a song for inclusion on her eponymous ''[[Kylie Minogue (album)|Kylie Minogue]]'' album, called \"[[Kylie Minogue (album)|Falling]]\", which was based on an unreleased remix of \"[[Go West (song)|Go West]]\" with new lyrics by Tennant; however, Minogue and her record company did not like the production sound of Pet Shop Boys' demo and asked [[Pete Heller|Farley & Heller]] to finally produce the track.\n\n===2002\u20132005===\n\nAfter the mixed fortunes of ''[[Closer to Heaven (musical)|Closer to Heaven]]'', Pet Shop Boys returned to the studio to start work on their eighth album. After toying with genres including [[hip hop music|hip hop]], they went for a stripped back [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound as a complete change from the over-the-top [[dance music]] of the musical. In 2002, they released the modestly successful album ''[[Release (Pet Shop Boys album)|Release]]''. Most of the tracks were produced by the duo themselves and many featured [[Johnny Marr]] on guitar. The first single, \"[[Home and Dry (Pet Shop Boys song)|Home and Dry]]\", featured a very peculiar [[music video|video]], directed by [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], mostly consisting of raw camcorder footage of mice filmed in the [[London Underground]]. The follow-up single \"[[I Get Along (Pet Shop Boys song)|I Get Along]]\" had a video filmed by [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], and after this they embarked on another world tour, although this time it was a stripped back affair, with no dancers, backing singers, costumes or lavish sets. They used two extra guitarists, [[Bic Hayes]] and [[Mark Refoy]], a percussionist (Dawne Adams) and regular [[Programming (music)|programmer]] (Pete Gleadall) alongside Chris Lowe (keyboards) and Neil Tennant (vocals and guitar).\n\nThe tour took them first to several universities around the UK; these dates saw them perform at [[Bristol University]], [[Keele University]], [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], [[University of Teesside]], [[Middlesbrough]] and [[De Montfort University]], [[Leicester]]. Subsequent dates took them to Germany, the U.S., Canada, Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, then another series of dates in the UK again, Switzerland and onto Japan, [[Singapore]], Hong Kong and then a first-ever date in [[Thailand]] as the final show, at the large [[Bangkok]] [[Impact, Muang Thong Thani|Impact Arena]], in front of 9,000 fans. A third single, \"London\", was only released in Germany, at the request of [[EMI|EMI Germany]]. It was never planned for release in the UK, although a promotional video was shot by the distinguished photographer [[Martin Parr]] and it was serviced to some UK radio stations. Following a live stint on the [[John Peel]] show on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], Pet Shop Boys released ''[[Disco 3]]'', in February 2003. The album followed their previous ''Disco'' albums, but this one also included new songs as well as remixes.\n\nIn 2003, Pet Shop Boys launched two new labels, Olde English Vinyl and Lucky Kunst, their [[Spaghetti Records]] label becoming defunct. The first release on Olde English Vinyl was [[Atomizer (band)|Atomizer]]'s \"Hooked on Radiation\", followed by [[Pete Burns]]' \"Jack and Jill Party\" in 2004. The only Lucky Kunst release to date is the mentioned [[Sam Taylor-Wood|Kiki Kokova]]'s version of \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]\". They also remixed [[Yoko Ono]]'s \"[[Walking on Thin Ice]]\" in 2003 and [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Mein Teil]]\" in 2004. Another new manager, David Dorrell, was brought on board to replace Clark.<ref name=\"chronology\">{{cite web | author=Mosler, Tomas | url = http://psb-atdeadofnight.net/chronology.php | title = Chronology | publisher=Pet Shop Boys at dead of night | access-date =14 June 2006 }}</ref> In November 2003, Pet Shop Boys released a second [[greatest hits album]], ''[[PopArt: Pet Shop Boys \u2013 The Hits]]'', a double [[Compilation album|compilation]] with two new singles: \"[[Miracles (Pet Shop Boys song)|Miracles]]\" and \"[[Flamboyant (Pet Shop Boys song)|Flamboyant]]\". Not chronologically arranged, the tracks were divided into two discs: ''[[Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits|Pop]]'' including the more traditional pop songs and ''[[Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits|Art]]'' containing those works which were considered more experimental.\n\nIn September 2004, Pet Shop Boys appeared at a free concert in [[Trafalgar Square]] in London, where they performed, with the Dresdner Sinfoniker orchestra, a whole new soundtrack to accompany the seminal 1925 [[silent film]] ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]''. There were four further live performances of the work with the Dresdner Sinfoniker in Germany in September 2005. The [[Battleship Potemkin (album)|''Battleship Potemkin'' soundtrack]] was then released on 5 September 2005. In November 2004, Pet Shop Boys played at the [[Prince's Trust]] concert titled ''Produced by Trevor Horn'' with other artists who had worked with the British producer [[Trevor Horn]], including [[Grace Jones]], [[ABC (band)|ABC]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] and [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]. In 2005, Pet Shop Boys was selected as the headline act for the [[Live 8 concert, Moscow|Moscow Live 8 concert]], in [[Red Square]]. They were received extremely well by the crowd in Moscow. Also in 2005, Pet Shop Boys were asked to put together the twentieth release in the ''[[Back to Mine]]'' series, an ongoing anthology showcasing artists' favourite music selections, with an emphasis on afterhours [[chill-out music]]. As a condition, [[Neil Tennant]] and [[Chris Lowe]] were given one disc each, whereas all previous releases in the series consisted of only a single disc per group (see ''[[Back to Mine: Pet Shop Boys]]'').\n\nIn July 2017, Pet Shop Boys reissued ''Release,'' as part of their 'Catalogue: 1985\u20132012' series.

The single reached number one in the UK and the Pet Shop Boys remix included new backing vocals performed by Tennant. Madonna subsequently used the Pet Shop Boys remix, including Tennant's vocals, on her 2006 [[Confessions Tour]]. In April, Pet Shop Boys released a new single that reached No.&nbsp;8 in the UK, \"[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]\", a commentary on the relationship between [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]]. The promo video featured [[Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]], better known as the team behind ''[[Little Britain (sketch show)|Little Britain]]''. Lucas and Walliams portray Tennant and Lowe, parodying two of the duo's previous videos, \"[[Go West (song)|Go West]]\", and \"[[Can You Forgive Her? (song)|Can You Forgive Her?]]\". The ninth Pet Shop Boys studio album, ''[[Fundamental (Pet Shop Boys album)|Fundamental]]'', followed in May, reaching a strong No.&nbsp;5 in their home country. The album was produced by [[Trevor Horn]], who Pet Shop Boys had previously worked with on \"[[Left to My Own Devices]]\", in 1988. The album was also released with a limited edition [[remix album]] called ''[[Fundamental (Pet Shop Boys album)|Fundamentalism]]'', which included a version of \"[[In Private]]\" as a duet with [[Elton John]] and \"[[Fundamental (Pet Shop Boys album)|Fugitive]]\", a new track produced by [[Richard X]].\n\nThe week that ''[[Fundamental (Pet Shop Boys album)|Fundamental]]'' was released, a documentary, titled ''Pet Shop Boys&nbsp;\u2013 A Life in Pop'', was broadcast on [[Channel 4]], directed by George Scott and produced by Nick de Grunwald. The original broadcast was less than an hour in duration; a 140-minute version was released on DVD in October 2006. Contributors to the programme included [[Robbie Williams]], [[Brandon Flowers]], [[Tim Rice-Oxley]], [[Jake Shears]] and [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]]. The DVD also contained promo videos that had been made since the release of ''[[PopArt: Pet Shop Boys \u2013 The Hits|PopArt]]'', although the promo for \"Flamboyant\" only appeared on early pressings of the DVD.\n\nThe second single to be taken from the album was the UK top twenty \"[[Minimal (song)|Minimal]]\". The duo filmed the video to the single in Paris with [[Dan Cameron]]. The single was the first of theirs to be playlisted by London's biggest radio station, [[Capital Radio]], in a decade. Pet Shop Boys began a worldwide [[Fundamental Tour|tour in support of ''Fundamental'']] in June 2006 in Norway. The show was designed and directed by [[Es Devlin]], the award-winning British theatre designer, and choreographed by Hakeem Onibudo. Between 15 June and 10 September 2006, Pet Shop Boys played a series of concert dates across Europe, mainly at assorted festivals and outdoor venues. These included two dates at the [[Tower of London]] on 28 June and 29, and a single show at [[Thetford Forest]]. These dates also included performances of ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'', in Germany and Spain. On 1 May 2006, ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' was also performed at the [[Swan Hunter]] shipyard, in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], with Pet Shop Boys accompanied by the [[Northern Sinfonia]] orchestra.\n\nOn 3 October 2006, the long-delayed U.S. release of their ''[[PopArt: Pet Shop Boys \u2013 The Hits|PopArt]]'' hits package was issued by [[Capitol Records]]. During 2006, Pet Shop Boys worked with [[Robbie Williams]] on his then-new album, ''[[Rudebox (album)|Rudebox]]'', producing two tracks: a cover version of \"[[Miracles (Pet Shop Boys song)|We're the Pet Shop Boys]]\", written by My Robot Friend (which they have also recorded themselves and released as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to \"[[Miracles (Pet Shop Boys song)|Miracles]]\", in 2003) and \"[[She's Madonna]]\", a duet with Tennant, allegedly about [[Guy Ritchie]]'s affair with [[Tania Strecker]], prior to his relationship with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. On 10 October 2006, Pet Shop Boys embarked on the [[Americas|North and Central American]] leg of their world [[concert tour|tour]], which took them through Canada, the United States and Mexico, concluding on 16 November. A DVD of the show in Mexico City was released on 21 May 2007, titled ''[[Cubism (video)|Cubism]]''. It was recorded on 14 November 2006, in the [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]], and was directed by David Barnard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=22784_0_2_0_C |title=Pet Shop Boys release 'Cubism', live DVD |website=Side-line.com |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 October, ''Catalogue'' was published by [[Thames & Hudson]], a 336-page hardcover book, written by [[Philip Hoare]] and [[Chris Heath]], detailing their entire visual output (photography, as well as the design of albums, [[Music videos|videos]], [[concert tour]]s, books and [[Fanzine|fan club magazines]]) from 1984 to 2004. Neil Tennant comments in the book: \"In the beginning we made a decision \u2013 and it was in our [[EMI]] contract \u2013 that that we would have control over how everything worked; that obviously the songs mattered hugely, but the way they were presented was going to matter hugely as well; and that we were never going to give up on that.\" Pet Shop Boys supported the publication of the book with signings in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Berlin. To coincide with the publication of ''Catalogue'', a small exhibition of portraits of Pet Shop Boys opened in the Bookshop Gallery of London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], on 30 October 2006 and ran to 28 February 2007.\n\nAlso on 16 October, the third single from ''[[Fundamental (Pet Shop Boys album)|Fundamental]]'', \"[[Numb (Pet Shop Boys song)|Numb]]\", was released, following its appearance at the end of the BBC's coverage of England at the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. It was written by [[Diane Warren]] and is the only song on the album not written by Tennant and Lowe. \"[[Numb (Pet Shop Boys song)|Numb]]\" became only the second Pet Shop Boys single in their career to miss the Top 20.\n\nOn 23 October 2006, ''[[Concrete (Pet Shop Boys album)|Concrete]]'' was released. It is a [[compact disc|double CD]] of the complete [[Mermaid Theatre]] concert, with the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] (musical director: Trevor Horn), featuring guests [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Frances Barber]] and [[Robbie Williams]]. A 90-minute \"director's cut\" of the concert aired on BBC [[6 Music]], on 28 August 2006. On 7 December 2006, Pet Shop Boys were nominated for two 2007 [[Grammy Awards]]. These were 'Best Dance Recording' for \"[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]\", and 'Best Electronic/Dance Album' for ''[[Fundamental (Pet Shop Boys album)|Fundamental]]''.\n\nDuring the latter part of 2006 and early 2007, Neil Tennant served as executive producer on [[Rufus Wainwright]]'salbum, ''[[Release the Stars]]'', recorded in Berlin. He sang backing vocals on a number of tracks, including \"[[Release the Stars|Do I Disappoint You]]\", and \"[[Release the Stars|Tiergarten]]\". They continued their world tour, albeit with a slightly different production and set-list, on 14 March 2007, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil then played concerts in [[Argentina]], Chile, New Zealand and Australia (as co-headliners of the [[V Festival]] 2007), Norway, [[Estonia]], Latvia, [[Lithuania]], Germany, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Belgium and [[Singapore]].

These include [[The Killers]], [[David Bowie]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Atomizer (band)|Atomizer]] and [[Rammstein]]. Only two tracks by Pet Shop Boys, remixed versions of ''[[Fundamental (Pet Shop Boys album)|Fundamental]]'' tracks \"[[Integral (song)|Integral]]\" and \"[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]\", were included.

Pet Shop Boys also appeared on [[Girls Aloud]]'s new album ''[[Out of Control (Girls Aloud album)|Out of Control]]'', collaborating on the Top-10 track \"[[The Loving Kind]]\", released on 12 January 2009 as a single. Originally written for Yes, The Loving Kind was deemed too bubblegum pop by Lowe and given to the popular girl group to record instead.\n\nOn 4 November 2009, Pet Shop Boys celebrated the Brazilian leg of the tour by releasing a compilation titled ''[[Party (Pet Shop Boys album)|Party]]'', including songs that were heavily featured in the following TV Globo soap operas: \"Being boring\" (''Meu Bem Meu Mal'' OST), \"Domino dancing\" (''O Salvador da Patria'' OST), \"West End Girls\" (''Selva de Pedra'' OST) and \"King of Rome\" (''[[Viver a Vida]]'').

Early in their career, the duo were frequently accused of lacking stage presence, said to be a deliberate reaction to the hyper-cheerful music of the time, demonstrated by bands such as [[Wham!]]. A typical early performance featured Lowe in the background playing the bassline on a [[Fairlight CMI|Fairlight]] synthesiser keyboard and Tennant singing, but otherwise passive, in the foreground. Tennant and Lowe both became well known for standing still throughout performances. In a 2016 interview, Chris Lowe said the duo's live performances were a response to the music scene in the 1980s: \"Everyone was so active. It was a big party where everyone was having a great time and smiling at the camera. Thumbs aloft! We just didn't want to do that. So we ignored the cameras and the jollity of the situations. Let's face it, it's easier to stand stock-still isn't it?\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/19915-pet-shop-boys-chris-lowe-interview|title=The Quietus \u2013 Features \u2013 A Quietus Interview \u2013 Pop Kid \u2013 Chris Lowe of Pet Shop Boys Interviewed|website=Thequietys.com|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen they first began touring, in 1989, they were heavily influenced by opera and theatre staging. [[Derek Jarman]] staged their first [[concert tour|tour]], making a series of films to be projected behind the costumed singers and dancers. In 1991, they brought in [[David Alden]] and David Fielding, from the [[English National Opera]], to create the staging and costume design, for a show which made little attempt to involve or even acknowledge the audience and pushed the choreography and [[staging (theatre)|staging]] centre-stage. Subsequent tours have used artist [[Sam Taylor-Wood]] and architect [[Zaha Hadid]] for stage design. The Fundamentalism tour in 2006\u20132007 was conceived and designed by theatre designer [[Es Devlin]], with choreography by Hakeem Onibudo. Es Devlin also conceived the 2009\u20132010 Pandemonium Tour as well as the Electric Tour beginning in 2013.\n\nTypically, Pet Shop Boys have favoured [[avant-garde]] tailored fashions. Tennant has referenced the designers of his suits in certain interviews and Lowe has often sported outfits and glasses made by [[Issey Miyake]], [[St\u00fcssy]] and [[Yohji Yamamoto]]'s [[Y-3 (fashion brand)|Y-3]] for [[Adidas]]. Presentation has always been a major theme for Pet Shop Boys and the duo have dramatically \"re-invented\" their image twice in their career. In 1993, when promoting their ''[[Very (Pet Shop Boys album)|Very]]'' album, they wore brightly-coloured costumes and used state-of-the-art computer technology to place themselves in a modern computer graphic world. This concept of re-invention was revisited for the promotion of their ''[[Nightlife (Pet Shop Boys album)|Nightlife]]'' album, in which they transformed their look, wearing wigs and glasses, with stylised futuristic urban wardrobes. In 2006, both Tennant and Lowe were seen on stage and in photographs wearing clothes designed by [[Hedi Slimane]]/[[Dior Homme]].\n\nThey have always been interested in the [[cover art|artwork]], design and photography of their own releases. Photographer [[Eric Watson (photographer)|Eric Watson]] helped shape the original image of Pet Shop Boys, creating many of their [[photography|photographs]] and [[music video|videos]] from 1984 to 1991. In design they have primarily worked with [[Mark Farrow]], who designed the [[cover art|cover]] of their first [[Parlophone]] album release in 1986. The collaboration between Mark Farrow and Pet Shop Boys is comparable to the designer/band relationship of [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Anton Corbijn]] and [[Depeche Mode]], or the epic-length collaboration of [[Simon Halfon]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]]. Their [[record sleeve]]s are quite often very [[minimalism|minimal]] and the attention to detail is obvious. In October 2006, British art publisher Thames & Hudson published a 336-page hardcover book titled ''Pet Shop Boys Catalogue'', by [[Chris Heath]] and [[Philip Hoare]], showcasing the group's accomplishments in artwork, design and music. A German-language edition was also published. An exhibition of photographs of Pet Shop Boys was organised at the National Portrait Gallery in London to coincide with the publication.\n\nEven the band's fan base has been subject to commentary. In 2001, music theorist Fred Everett Maus wrote that, contrary to the ideologies of anti-commercialism and [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] embodied by \"serious\" discussions of [[popular music]] such as rock, Pet Shop Boys fans exhibit \"an undisguised love of commercial success\". This was demonstrated through [[mailing list]] discussions from 1998 onwards, in which fans voiced concern over the \"most commercially promising selection and marketing of singles\" for the then-upcoming ''Nightlife'', and debated the quality of the then-recent ''Bilingual'', spurred by the album's poorer performance in sales. Most posters, Maus summarised, feared that the band's appeal would become essentially limited to a [[cult following]]; \"dissent, along the lines that the fans would always have the Pet Shop Boys, no matter what happened commercially, was scarce and ineffectual\". Noting the fact that Pet Shop Boys \"began their career with hits\", Maus made the point that this early success was valued by fans: the band's \"large audiences\" were just as important to \"many fans\" as the making of \"distinctive music that individual fans loved\".<ref name=\"popular\">{{Citation | last=Maus | first=Fred E. | title=Glamour and evasion: the fabulous ambivalence of the Pet Shop Boys | journal=Popular Music | year=2001 | volume=20 | issue=3 |pages=381\u201382 | issn=0261-1430 | doi=10.1017/s0261143001001568| s2cid=161096920 }}</ref>\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys have been noted for keeping their fingers on the musical pulse to date, while \"maintaining the mystique of performers from a different era\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Lynn Barber, writing for the London Observer on July 1, 1997 stated that \"The genius of the Pet Shop Boys was to combine these polar opposites: Neil's wistful introspective lyrics and Chris's mindless, cheerful, upbeat rhythms.

In the liner notes to their 1991 [[greatest hits album]], ''[[Discography: The Complete Singles Collection|Discography]]'', the band states that: \"When we wrote this song (\"Heart\") we wanted to submit it to Madonna but didn't dare risk disappointment.\" Pet Shop Boys kept the song for themselves and it ended up going to number one in the UK. Later, in 1991, Madonna was referenced in a tongue-in-cheek lyric, in the song \"[[DJ Culture]]\", soon after she and [[Sean Penn]] had divorced. Tennant writes: \"Like Liz before Betty / She after Sean / Suddenly you're missing / Then you're reborn\". Madonna's album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'', released November 2005, includes a track called \"[[Jump (Madonna song)|Jump]]\", which has close similarities to \"West End Girls\".<ref>Shawhan, Jason (20 November 2005).

Pet Shop Boys then remixed \"[[Sorry (Madonna song)|Sorry]]\", the second single from the album. Madonna has used their version in her 2006 ''[[Confessions Tour|Confessions]]'' tour. [[Lady Gaga]] stated that she listened regularly to the Pet Shop Boys while working on her debut album ''[[The Fame]]'', and that they were an influence on her music.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvC7NmOSUko Arte Tracks] (German-French magazine by [[Arte]]), YouTube. 2:50-3:10min.</ref>\n\nIn October 2005, a Swedish [[tribute band]] called [[West End Girls (Swedish band)|West End Girls]] had a number three [[hit single]] in their home country, with a cover version of \"[[Domino Dancing]]\".
