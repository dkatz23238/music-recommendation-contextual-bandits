Cooper's androgynous stage role had developed to present a [[villain]]ous side, portraying a potential threat to modern society. The success of the band's single and album, and their tour of 1971, which included their first tour of Europe (audience members reportedly included [[Elton John]] and a pre-[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy]] [[David Bowie]]), provided enough encouragement for Warner Bros. to offer the band a new multi-album contract.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nTheir follow-up album ''[[Killer (Alice Cooper album)|Killer]]'', released in late 1971, continued the commercial success of ''Love It to Death'' and included further single success with \"[[Under My Wheels]]\", \"Be My Lover\" in early 1972, and \"[[Halo of Flies (song)|Halo of Flies]]\", which became a Top 10 hit in the Netherlands in 1973. Thematically, ''Killer'' expanded on the villainous side of Cooper's androgynous stage role, with its music becoming the soundtrack to the group's morality-based stage show, which by then featured a [[boa constrictor]] hugging Cooper on-stage, the murderous axe chopping of bloodied baby dolls, and execution by hanging at the [[gallows]]. In January 1972, Cooper was again asked about his peculiar name, and told talk-show hostess [[Dinah Shore]] that he took the name from a \"[[Mayberry R.F.D.|Mayberry RFD]]\" character.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe summer of 1972 saw the release of the single \"[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]\".

The album ''[[School's Out (album)|School's Out]]'' reached No. 2 on the US charts and sold over a million copies.

An unsolicited theme song was recorded for the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] movie ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', but a different song of the same name by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] was chosen instead. By 1974, the ''Muscle of Love'' album still had not matched the top-charting success of its predecessor, and the band began to have constant disagreements. For various reasons, the members agreed to take what was expected to be a temporary hiatus. \"Everyone decided they needed a rest from one another\", said manager Shep Gordon at the time. \"A lot of pressure had built up, but it's nothing that can't be dealt with. Everybody still gets together and talks.\" Journalist Bob Greene spent several weeks on the road with the band during the ''Muscle of Love Christmas Tour'' in 1973.

To avoid legal complications over ownership of the group name, \"Alice Cooper\" had by then become the singer's new legal name. Speaking on the subject of Alice Cooper continuing as a solo project as opposed to the band it once was, Cooper stated in 1975, \"It got very basically down to the fact that we had drawn as much as we could out of each other. After ten years, we got pretty dry together.\" Manager Gordon added, \"What had started in a sense as a pipe-dream became an overwhelming burden.\"<ref name=\"news.google.ca\"/> The success of ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' marked the final break-up of the original members of the band, with Cooper collaborating with their producer Bob Ezrin, who recruited [[Lou Reed]]'s backing band, including guitarists [[Dick Wagner]] and [[Steve Hunter]], to play on the album. Spearheaded by the US Top 20 hit ballad \"[[Only Women Bleed]]\", the album was released by [[Atlantic Records]] in March of that year and became a Top 10 hit for Cooper. It was a concept album that was based on the nightmare of a child named Steven, featuring narration by classic horror movie film star [[Vincent Price]], and serving as the soundtrack to Cooper's new stage show, which now showcased more theatrics than ever, including an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} furry [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] which Cooper decapitated and killed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAccompanying the album and stage show was the television special ''The Nightmare'', starring Cooper and [[Vincent Price]], which aired on US prime-time TV in April 1975. ''The Nightmare'' (which was later released on home video in 1983 and gained a [[Grammy Awards]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Best Long Form Music Video]]) was regarded as another groundbreaking moment in rock history. Adding to it all, a concert film, ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare (film)|Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', produced, directed, and choreographed by [[West Side Story]] cast member [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]] and filmed live at [[London]]'s [[Wembley Arena]] in September 1975, was released to theaters in 1976.

The subsequent tour's stage show was based inside an asylum, and was filmed for Cooper's first home-video release, ''[[The Strange Case of Alice Cooper]]'', in 1979. Around this time, Cooper performed \"Welcome to My Nightmare\", \"You and Me\", and \"School's Out\" on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (episode #307) on March 28, 1978 (he played one of the [[devil]]'s henchmen trying to dupe [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]], [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] and Miss Piggy into selling their souls). He also appeared in an against-typecasting role as a piano-playing disco waiter in [[Mae West]]'s final film, ''[[Sextette]]'', and as a villain in the film ''[[Sgt.

Cooper himself contributed over $27,000 to the project, buying an O in the sign in memory of close friend and comedian [[Groucho Marx]]. In 1979, Alice also guest starred on good friend [[Soupy Sales]]' show, ''[[Soupy Sales#Lunch with Soupy Sales|Lunch with Soupy Sales]]'' and was hit in the face with a pie, as part of the show. When asked about the experience, Alice had this to say about his pal: \"Being from Detroit, I came home every day and watched Soupy at lunch (Lunch with Soupy Sales).

''Flush the Fashion'', produced by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] producer [[Roy Thomas Baker]], had a thick, edgy [[New wave music|new wave]] musical sound that baffled even longtime fans, though it still yielded the US Top 40 hit \"[[Clones (We're All)]]\".

His tour for ''Special Forces'' marked Cooper's last time on the road for nearly five years; it was not until 1986, for ''[[Constrictor (album)|Constrictor]]'', that he toured again. 1982's ''Zipper Catches Skin'' was a more [[pop punk]]-oriented recording, containing many quirky high-energy guitar-driven songs along with his most unusual collection of subject matters for lyrics. 1983 marked the return collaboration of producer [[Bob Ezrin]] and guitarist [[Dick Wagner]] for the haunting epic ''DaDa'', the final album in his Warner Bros. contract.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice Cooper \u2013 DaDa |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dada-mw0000461389 |website=Allmusic |access-date=November 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423184309/https://www.allmusic.com/album/dada-mw0000461389 |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn mid-1983, after the recording of ''DaDa'', Cooper was hospitalized for alcoholism again, and [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/content.php?id=timelines/t-zcs.php |title=Timeline \u2013 Zipper Catches Skin |work=SickthingsUK |access-date=April 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319133014/http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/content.php?id=timelines%2Ft-zcs.php |archive-date=March 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Cooper was finally stable and sober (and has remained sober since that time) by the time ''DaDa'' and ''The Nightmare'' home video (of his 1975 TV Special) were released in the fall of that year; however, both releases performed below expectations.

The album spawned the hits \"[[He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)]]\" (the theme song for the movie ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]]''; in the video for the song Cooper was given a cameo role as a deranged psychiatrist) and the fan favorite \"Teenage Frankenstein\". The Constrictor album was a catalyst for Cooper to make a triumphant return to the road for the first time since the 1981 ''Special Forces'' project, on a tour appropriately entitled ''The Nightmare Returns''. The Detroit leg of this tour, which took place at the end of October 1986 during [[Halloween]], was captured on film as ''[[The Nightmare Returns]]'', and is viewed by some as being the definitive Alice Cooper concert film.

The subsequent tour of ''Raise Your Fist and Yell'', which was heavily inspired by the slasher horror movies of the time such as the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' series and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', served up a shocking spectacle similar to its predecessor, and courted the kind of controversy, especially in Europe, that recalled the public outrage caused by Cooper's public performances in America in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Raise Your Fist and Yell \u2013 Alice Cooper |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/raise-your-fist-and-yell-mw0000651209 |website=Allmusic |access-date=November 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423184247/https://www.allmusic.com/album/raise-your-fist-and-yell-mw0000651209 |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn Britain, Labour MP [[David Blunkett]] called for the show to be banned, saying \"I'm horrified by his behaviour \u2013 it goes beyond the bounds of entertainment.\" The controversy spilled over into the German segment of the tour, with the German government actually succeeding in having some of the gorier segments of the performance removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/timelines/t-ryfay.php |title=Timeline: Raise Your Fist And Yell 1987 |work=SickthingsUK |access-date=April 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318030447/http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/timelines/t-ryfay.php |archive-date=March 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was also during the London leg of the tour that Cooper met with a near fatal accident during rehearsal of the hanging execution sequence that occurs at the end of the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/theatrics/gallows.php |title=The Gallows |work=SickthingsUK |access-date=April 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318030452/http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/theatrics/gallows.php |archive-date=March 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''Constrictor'' (1986) and ''Raise Your Fist and Yell'' (1987) were recorded with lead guitarist [[Kane Roberts]] and bassist [[Kip Winger]], both of whom would leave the band by the end of 1988 (although Kane Roberts played guitar on \"[[Bed of Nails (song)|Bed of Nails]]\" on 1989's album ''[[Trash (Alice Cooper album)|Trash]]'').\n\nIn 1987, Cooper made a brief appearance as a vagrant in the horror movie ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'', directed by [[John Carpenter]].

When my parents would start talking politics, I would go in my room and put on [[the Rolling Stones]] or [[the Who]] as long as I could avoid politics. And I still feel that way.\"<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\"/>\n\nOn occasion, Cooper has spoken out against musicians who promote or opine on politics; for example, in the build-up to the [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004 presidential election]], he told [[The Canadian Press]] that the rock stars campaigning for and touring on behalf of [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate [[John Kerry]] were committing \"treason against rock n' roll\".
