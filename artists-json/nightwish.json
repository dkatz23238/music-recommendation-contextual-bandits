The band would be acoustic and its style would be mood  music.

It was clear that it had to have a female singer, because at the time, [[The Third and the Mortal|The 3rd and the Mortal]], [[Theatre of Tragedy]] from Norway, and [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]] from Holland were a big thing to me.
