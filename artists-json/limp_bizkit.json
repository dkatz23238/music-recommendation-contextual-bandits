The band achieved mainstream success with its second and third studio albums, ''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]'' (1999) and ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]'' (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding its performances at [[Woodstock '99]] and the 2001 [[Big Day Out]] festival.\n\nBorland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto, and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist [[Mike Smith (guitarist)|Mike Smith]].

In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album ''[[Gold Cobra]]'' (2011), after which it left Interscope and later signed with [[Cash Money Records]]; DJ Lethal quit the band soon afterward, returning in 2018.

The band's local popularity was such that [[Sugar Ray]], who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group [[Funkdoobiest]].<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> Milkbar owner Danny Wimmer stated that Limp Bizkit \"had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred ... was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools.\"<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> However, the band knew that to achieve national success, it would have to distinguish themselves in its live performances.<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> Attracting crowds by [[word of mouth]], the band gave energetic live performances, covering [[George Michael]]'s \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\" and [[Paula Abdul]]'s \"[[Straight Up (Paula Abdul song)|Straight Up]]\" and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes.<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.<ref name=\"Devenish21\" />\n\nDurst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager.<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> Later when [[Korn]] performed in town as the opening act for [[Sick of It All]], Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade [[Reginald Arvizu|Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu]] to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs \"Pollution\", \"[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]\", and \"Stalemate\".

Arvizu persuaded [[Ross Robinson]] to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song \"Sour\".<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, \"Everything\".<ref name=\"Devenish21\" />\n\nDespite the success of live performances of the band's cover of the song \"Faith\", Robinson was opposed to recording it and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming as well as DJ scratching, impressed him.<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously.<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> The [[progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song \"Nobody Loves Me\", which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of [[Maynard James Keenan]].<ref name=\"Devenish21\" />\n\nContinuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, Limp Bizkit named the album by using part of the phrase \"queer as a three dollar bill\" and adding the word \"Y'all\" for Florida flavor, titling it ''[[Three Dollar Bill, Y'all]]''.<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to its music.<ref name=\"Devenish21\" />\n\nAfter the band completed recording, it toured with Korn and [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]] in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'' music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating \"The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's [[Rap metal|rap/thrash]] show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for [[Homosexuality|gay]] men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile.\"<ref name=\"Devenish21\" /> That same year, they also notably served as an opening act on the [[Album of the Year Tour]] for [[Faith No More]], a band often credited as paving the way for Limp Bizkit and the [[nu metal]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/2015/8/13/they-did-it-all-for-the-nookie-decibel-explores-the-rise-and-fall-of-nu-metal|title=They Did It All for the Nookie: Decibel Explores the Rise and Fall of Nu-Metal|date=August 13, 2015|access-date=January 18, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226193814/http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/2015/8/13/they-did-it-all-for-the-nookie-decibel-explores-the-rise-and-fall-of-nu-metal/|archive-date=February 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They were subject to a hostile reception from Faith No More's fans,<ref name=\"toomey\">Borland, Wes. 2017.
