Isaac Slade and guitarist Joe King were several years ahead of drummer Ben Wysocki at Faith Christian Academy. Wysocki and guitarist David Welsh played in the same worship band. In the spring of 2002, former schoolmates Slade and King reconnected and began regular two-man jam sessions that led to writing songs. Slade and King later added Mike Ayars on guitar, Zach Johnson on drums,<ref name=\"lost\">{{Cite web |title=The Lost Members |url=http://www.frayawaytheedges.net/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109012915/http://www.frayawaytheedges.net/ |archive-date=January 9, 2007 |access-date=August 29, 2021 |website=Fray Away the Edges |location=About the Guys: The Lost Members}}</ref> and Slade's younger brother Caleb on bass, though Caleb was later asked to leave. Caleb's departure from the band caused a rift in his relationship with Isaac, and this rift later became the inspiration for the song \"[[Over My Head (Cable Car)]]\", which is about the brothers' waning relationship.<ref name=\"Gitlin\">{{Cite magazine |last=Gitlin |first=Lauren |date=August 10, 2006 |title=Enter the Fray |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Following this Johnson left the band to attend an art school in New York.<ref name=\"lost\" />\n\nBen Wysocki, a former bandmate of Isaac Slade, joined as drummer and later, Dave Welsh, who was another former bandmate of Slade and Wysocki, was added as lead guitarist to the band. The newly formed band was named the Fray. The band members decided on a name after asking people to put band names on a piece of paper from which they picked randomly. The members of the band first claimed that they found the name suitable because they frequently quarreled about the composition of the lyrics in their songs, but they have since stated they are usually on good terms while composing music and acknowledge contributions from all members.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tomlinson |first=Sarah |date=February 24, 2006 |title=Life Less Ordinary |work=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2006/02/24/life_less_ordinary/ |access-date=February 13, 2010}}</ref> The band has had no permanent bassist since Caleb, instead employing touring bassists on a temporary basis.
