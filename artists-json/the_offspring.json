By the end of the album's supporting tour, The Offspring had started playing at larger venues such as theaters and arenas as opposed to the clubs and smaller venues they were previously accustomed to.<ref name=\"past dates\" />\n\nThat same year (1995) the band decided to buy out the rights to their first album. Holland and Kriesel had created their own record label [[Nitro Records]] and started signing bands. One of their first releases was a re-release of the band's 1989 debut album ''[[The Offspring (album)|The Offspring]]''. The label also signed a number of punk bands including the Vandals, Guttermouth, [[Jughead's Revenge]], and [[AFI (band)|AFI]].

The album was released on February 4, 1997, which was also Noodles' 34th birthday. This album was not as successful as ''Smash'', although it did sell four million units and spawned five singles. The album saw the band move away from the political-punk themes common to many Epitaph bands and more into mainstream rock with songs like \"[[Gone Away (song)|Gone Away]]\" and \"[[I Choose]]\". The video for the last track was directed by Holland himself. Dexter commented that ''Ixnay'' was probably not as well received as ''Smash'' because it was such a departure, and that many fans probably were expecting ''Smash Part Two''.<ref>''Complete Music Video Collection'' (2005).</ref>\n\nIn 1998 the Offspring released ''[[Americana (The Offspring album)|Americana]]''. Three of the album's singles, \"[[Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)]]\"; \"[[Why Don't You Get a Job?]]\"; and \"[[The Kids Aren't Alright]]\", became the band's biggest hits and made the album the peak of the Offspring's mainstream popularity. The former song topped the charts in nine countries including Australia, Japan, Norway, and the United Kingdom. \"[[She's Got Issues]]\" was also released as a single and was a minor hit.\n\nIn 1999, the band appeared as themselves in the film ''[[Idle Hands]]''. They played a cover version of \"[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]\" (originally by the [[Ramones]]) and \"Beheaded\" at a school dance before Holland's character is killed.

The band's former labelmates [[NOFX]] poked fun at them for this in their song \"Whoa on the Whoas\". Several tracks also incorporate elements of Eastern music, which can be heard on the likes of \"Tehran\", \"Me & My Old Lady\", \"Pay the Man\", \"Dividing By Zero\", and the verse hook from \"Come Out and Play\". Their lyrics cover a wide range of topics, like personal relationships, such as in their songs \"She's Got Issues\", \"Self Esteem\" and \"Spare Me the Details\", and the degradation of the United States, politics, and society in general with songs like \"It'll Be a Long Time\", \"Americana\" and \"Stuff Is Messed Up\". The lyrics generally reflect a sarcastic viewpoint, which, along with the language, can be offensive to some. This is acknowledged in the opening track from their album ''[[Ixnay on the Hombre]]'', \"Disclaimer\", which is sarcastic itself. Like \"Disclaimer\", the first track of most of the Offspring's albums are an introduction of some sort; \"Time to Relax\" (from ''Smash''), \"Welcome\" (from ''Americana''), \"Intro\" (from ''Conspiracy of One''), and \"Neocon\" (from ''Splinter'') are also examples of this.
