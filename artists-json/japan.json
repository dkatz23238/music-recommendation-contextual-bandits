It is situated in the northwest [[Pacific Ocean]], and is bordered on the west by the [[Sea of Japan]], while extending from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north toward the [[East China Sea]], [[Philippine Sea]], and [[Taiwan]] in the south. Japan is a part of the [[Ring of Fire]], and spans [[Japanese archipelago|an archipelago]] of [[List of islands of Japan|6852 islands]] covering {{convert|377,975|km2|mi2|sp=us|abbr=|comma=5}}; the five main islands are [[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]] (the \"mainland\"), [[Shikoku]], [[Kyushu]], and [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]]. [[Tokyo]] is the [[Capital of Japan|nation's capital]] and largest city, followed by [[Yokohama]], [[Osaka]], [[Nagoya]], [[Sapporo]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Kobe]], and [[Kyoto]].\n\nJapan is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|eleventh most populous country]] in the world, as well as one of the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most densely populated]] and [[Urbanization by country|urbanized]]. About three-fourths of [[Geography of Japan|the country's terrain]] is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.5 million on narrow [[coastal plains]]. Japan is divided into [[Prefectures of Japan|47 administrative prefectures]] and [[List of regions of Japan|eight traditional regions]]. The [[Greater Tokyo Area]] is the [[List of largest cities|most populous metropolitan area]] in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.\n\nJapan [[Japanese Paleolithic|has been inhabited]] since the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (30,000 BC), though the first written mention of the archipelago appears in a Chinese chronicle (the ''[[Book of Han]]'') finished in the 2nd century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under [[Emperor of Japan|an emperor]] and [[Imperial House of Japan|the imperial court]] based in [[Heian-ky\u014d]]. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators ({{transliteration|ja|[[Shogun|sh\u014dgun]]}}) and feudal lords ({{transliteration|ja|[[Daimyo|daimy\u014d]]}}) and enforced by a class of warrior nobility ([[samurai]]). After [[Sengoku period|a century-long period of civil war]], the country was reunified in 1603 under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which enacted [[Sakoku|an isolationist foreign policy]]. In 1854, [[Perry Expedition|a United States fleet]] forced Japan to [[Bakumatsu|open trade to the West]], which led to [[Boshin War|the end of the shogunate]] and [[Meiji Restoration|the restoration of imperial power]] in 1868.\n\nIn the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji period]], the [[Empire of Japan]] adopted [[Meiji Constitution|a Western-modeled constitution]] and pursued a program of [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and [[Modernization theory|modernization]]. Amidst a rise in militarism and overseas colonization, Japan [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invaded China]] in 1937 and entered [[World War II]] as an [[Axis powers|Axis power]] in 1941. After suffering defeat in the [[Pacific War]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two atomic bombings]], Japan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] in 1945 and came under a seven-year [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]], during which it adopted a [[Constitution of Japan|new constitution]] and began [[U.S.-Japan Alliance|a military alliance with the United States]]. Under the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature, the [[National Diet]].\n\nJapan is a highly [[developed country]], and a [[great power]] in [[global politics]]. Its [[Economy of Japan|economy]] is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|third-largest by nominal GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth-largest by PPP]]. Although Japan has [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|renounced its right to declare war]], the country maintains [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]] that rank as one of the world's strongest militaries. After World War II, Japan experienced record growth in [[Japanese economic miracle|an economic miracle]], becoming the [[List of countries by largest historical GDP|second-largest economy]] in the world by 1972 but has [[Economic stagnation|stagnated]] since 1995 in what is referred to as the [[Lost Decades]]. Japan has the world's [[List of countries by life expectancy|highest life expectancy]], though it is experiencing [[Aging of Japan|a decline in population]]. A global leader in the [[Automotive industry in Japan|automotive]], [[Japanese robotics|robotics]] and [[Electronics industry in Japan|electronics industries]], the country has made significant contributions to [[Science and technology in Japan|science and technology]]. The [[culture of Japan]] is well known around the world, including its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]], [[Music of Japan|music]], and [[Japanese popular culture|popular culture]], which encompasses prominent [[Manga|comic]], [[Anime|animation]] and [[Video games in Japan|video game]] industries. It is a member of numerous international organizations, including the [[United Nations]] (since 1956), [[OECD]], [[G20]] and [[Group of Seven]].\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of Japan}}\n\n{{Infobox Chinese\n| kanji = {{linktext|\u65e5\u672c\u56fd}}\n| hiragana = {{linktext|\u306b\u3063\u307d\u3093\u3053\u304f}}<br />{{linktext|\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3053\u304f}}\n| katakana = {{linktext|\u30cb\u30c3\u30dd\u30f3\u30b3\u30af}}<br />{{linktext|\u30cb\u30db\u30f3\u30b3\u30af}}\n| kyujitai = {{linktext|\u65e5\u672c\u570b}}\n| romaji = Nippon-koku<br />Nihon-koku\n}}\nThe name for Japan in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is written using the [[kanji]] {{nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c}} and is pronounced {{transliteration|ja|Nippon}} or {{transliteration|ja|Nihon}}.<ref name=\"schreiber\">{{cite web|last1=Schreiber|first1=Mark|title=You say 'Nihon,' I say 'Nippon,' or let's call the whole thing 'Japan'?|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2019/11/26/language/nihon-nippon-japan/|website=[[The Japan Times]]|date=November 26, 2019}}</ref> Before {{nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c}} was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as {{transliteration|zh|[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]}} ({{nihongo2|\u502d}}, changed in Japan around 757 to {{Nihongo2|\u548c}}) and in Japan by the [[endonym]] {{transliteration|ja|[[Yamato (disambiguation)|Yamato]]}}.<ref name=\"carr\">{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Michael|title=Wa Wa Lexicography|journal=International Journal of Lexicography|date=March 1992|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1\u201331|doi=10.1093/ijl/5.1.1|url=https://academic.oup.com/ijl/article/5/1/1/950449|url-access=subscription|via=[[Oxford Academic]]}}</ref> {{transliteration|ja|Nippon}}, the original [[Sino-Japanese reading]] of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on [[Japanese yen|banknotes]] and postage stamps.<ref name=\"schreiber\" /> {{transliteration|ja|Nihon}} is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in [[Japanese phonology]] during the [[Edo period]].<ref name=\"carr\" /> The characters {{nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c}} mean \"sun origin\",<ref name=\"schreiber\" /> which is the source of the popular Western [[epithet]] \"Land of the Rising Sun\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Emergence of Japanese Kingship|author1-link=Joan R.
