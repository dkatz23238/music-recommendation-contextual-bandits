Do NOT change to \"is\" -->re an English [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1969. They have sold over 50 million copies of their albums, and are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band had struggled with indifferent record production and a lack of major commercial success until 1980, when they rose to commercial success with the album ''[[British Steel (album)|British Steel]]''.\n\nThe band's membership has seen much turnover, including a revolving cast of drummers in the 1970s and the departure of singer [[Rob Halford]] in 1992. [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]], formerly of [[Winter's Bane]], replaced Halford in 1996 and recorded two albums with Judas Priest, before Halford returned to the band in 2003. The current line-up consists of Halford, guitarists [[Glenn Tipton]] and [[Richie Faulkner]], bassist [[Ian Hill]] and drummer [[Scott Travis]]. The band's best-selling album is 1982's ''[[Screaming for Vengeance]]'', with their most commercially successful line-up featuring Hill, Halford, Tipton, guitarist [[K. K. Downing]], and drummer [[Dave Holland (drummer)|Dave Holland]]. Tipton and Hill are the only two members of the band to appear on every album.\n\nHalford's operatic vocal style and the twin guitar sound of Downing and Tipton have been a major influence on heavy metal bands. Judas Priest's image of leather, spikes, and other taboo articles of clothing were widely influential during the [[glam metal]] era of the 1980s. ''[[The Guardian]]'' referred to ''British Steel'' as the record that defines heavy metal. Despite a decline in exposure during the mid 1990s, the band has once again seen a resurgence, including worldwide tours, being inaugural inductees into the [[VH1 Rock Honors]] in 2006, receiving a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] in 2010, and having their songs featured in video games such as ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series. In 2022, Judas Priest were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hammerpublished |first=Metal |date=2022-05-04 |title=At last \u2013 Judas Priest will finally make it into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/judas-priest-rock-roll-hall-fame-2022 |access-date=2022-05-06 |website=loudersound |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins (1969\u20131974) ===\nJudas Priest was formed in 1969 in [[Birmingham]],<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Bowe|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-hIN6L4zyTgC&pg=PA27 27]}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |last=Regeniter|first=Anna|date=2018-03-12 |title=Reise Know-How CityTrip Birmingham|language=de |publisher=Reise Know-How Verlag Peter Rump|isbn=978-3-8317-4930-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gh4DwAAQBAJ&q=birmingham+Judas+Priest&pg=PA81}}</ref> England, by lead vocalist [[Al Atkins]] and bassist Brian \"Bruno\" Stapenhill, with John Perry on guitars and John \"Fezza\" Partridge on drums.

Late in the year, Atkins found a heavy rock band called Freight rehearsing without a singer, made up of K. K. Downing on guitars, his childhood friend [[Ian Hill|Ian \"Skull\" Hill]] on bass, and drummer John Ellis.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=3}} He joined them, and they took on Atkins' defunct band's name.

The show was recorded and part of it released in 2019 on the compilation \"[[Downer-Rock Asylum]]\" on the [[Audio Archives]] label along with one live song from the Atkins era.\n\nJudas Priest made their first tour of continental Europe in early 1974 and they returned to England that April to sign a recording deal with the label [[Gull (record label)|Gull]].{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=8}} Gull suggested adding a fifth member to fill in the band's sound; they took on as a second lead guitarist [[Glenn Tipton]],{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=8}} whose group [[The Flying Hat Band]] were also managed by Iommi's agency.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=5}}\n\n=== ''Rocka Rolla'' (1974\u20131975) ===\nJudas Priest went into the studio in June\u2013July 1974 with Black Sabbath producer [[Rodger Bain]].{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=17}} The band released their debut single \"[[Rocka Rolla (song)|Rocka Rolla]]\" that August{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and followed in September with an [[Rocka Rolla|album of the same name]].{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=17}} The album features a variety of styles\u2014straight-up rock, heavy riffing, and [[Progressive rock|progressive]].{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=16}}\n\nTechnical problems during the recording contributed to the poor sound quality of the record.

The next release, 1981's ''[[Point of Entry]]'', followed the same formula, and [[British Steel Tour|the tour in support]] of the album featured new songs such as \"Solar Angels\" and \"[[Heading Out to the Highway]]\".\n\nThe 1982 album ''[[Screaming for Vengeance]]'' featured \"[[You've Got Another Thing Comin']]\", which became a major radio hit in the US. Songs such as \"[[Electric Eye (song)|Electric Eye]]\" and \"Riding on the Wind\" also appeared on this album, and proved to be popular live. \"[[(Take These) Chains]]\" (by [[Bob Halligan Jr]]) was released as a single and received heavy airplay.

For example, their first album, ''[[Rocka Rolla]]'' (1974), is primarily rooted in heavy [[blues rock]]. From ''[[Sad Wings of Destiny]]'' (1976) through ''[[Stained Class]]'' (1978), their style was somewhat progressive, with complex guitar passages and poetic lyrics. Songs would often shift in dynamics and tempo, and the music was some of the heaviest of its day. This would later have a major influence on [[progressive metal]] and [[stoner rock]] bands.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} 1977's ''[[Sin After Sin]]'' used a combination of [[double bass drum]] (or \"double kick\") and rapid 16th-note bass rhythms combined with rapid 16th-note guitar rhythms used by [[Black Sabbath]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]], and [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] that came to define the genre.<ref name=Cope>{{cite book|author=Andrew Laurence Cope|title=Black Sabbath and the Rise of Heavy Metal Music|date=28 January 2013|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-4094-9398-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ft-hAgAAQBAJ&q=Dissident%20Aggressor&pg=PT139}}</ref> While the double-bass rhythms of Judas Priest are generally measured and technical, the song \"[[Dissident Aggressor]]\" (1977) pushed an increase in \"tempo and aggression\" which was later adopted by other bands with a much harder-edged approach.<ref name=Cope />\n\nStarting with their fifth album, ''[[Killing Machine]]'' (1978), the band began to incorporate a more commercial, radio-friendly style to their music.

With their eighth album, ''[[Screaming for Vengeance]]'' (1982), the band incorporated a balance of these two styles. This continued on ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]'' (1984). With the follow-up album, ''[[Turbo (Judas Priest album)|Turbo]]'' (1986), the band incorporated guitar synthesizers into its signature heavy metal sound. On 1988's ''[[Ram It Down]]'' the band retained some of the more commercial qualities of ''Turbo'' but also returned to some of the fast tempo heavy metal found on their earlier works. This fast-tempo style continued with 1990's ''[[Painkiller (Judas Priest album)|Painkiller]]''. ''[[Jugulator]]'' (1997) tried to incorporate some of the 1990s contemporary groove metal styles. ''[[Demolition (Judas Priest album)|Demolition]]'' (2001) has a more traditional heavy metal sound with [[nu metal]] elements. Following the return of Halford for ''[[Angel of Retribution]]'' and ''[[Nostradamus (album)|Nostradamus]]'', the band returned to the style of its early albums.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nThe band's popularity and status as one of the exemplary and influential heavy metal bands has earned them the nickname \"Metal Gods\" from their [[Metal Gods|song of the same name]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Berelian |first=Essi |title=The Rough Guide to Heavy Metal |year=2005 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn= 1-84353-415-0 |page=172}}</ref>\n\n=== Vocal style and influences ===\nHalford listened to and was influenced by [[Little Richard]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Robert Plant]] as a vocalist.

For the 1979 tour, Halford adopted his now-trademark leather-and-studs look, inspired by punk fashion and [[leather culture]]. The rest of the band adopted a similar style which became prominent at the time of their 1978 release, ''[[Killing Machine]]''. This style would go on to be adopted by many heavy metal bands in the early 1980s, especially those of the [[NWOBHM]] and early [[black metal]] movements.<ref>{{cite news| title=Hell Bent for Leather/Killing Machine Info Page| publisher=Judas Priest Info Pages| url=http://members.firstinter.net/markster/KILLINGMACHINE.html| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702171452/http://members.firstinter.net/markster/KILLINGMACHINE.html| archive-date=2 July 2007}}</ref> To this day, it is not uncommon to find metal artists and fans sporting such a look at concerts.\n\nIn a published quote on the back cover of [[K.

I knew we were a great band...but something was not quite complete. The leather and studs image came along and it all started to complete itself.
