The two shared an interest in using real instruments and vintage recording equipment, as well as a love of R&B, jazz, and rock. Kravitz would go on to collaborate with Hirsch on most of his albums. Kravitz began working on his debut album with Hirsch over the next year and a half, with Kravitz's father paying for the studio time. Kravitz met saxophonist [[Karl Denson]] and invited him to play on the song \"[[Let Love Rule (song)|Let Love Rule]].\" Kravitz was so impressed with his playing that Denson played on much of the album. Beginning in the late 1980s, Denson toured with Kravitz for five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knkx.org/jazz-and-blues/2019-03-15/the-new-cool-karl-denson-talks-kravitz-stones-skerik-sexual-chocolate-and-his-new-album|title=The New Cool: Karl Denson talks Kravitz, Stones, Skerik, Sexual Chocolate and his new album.|date=March 15, 2019|website=Knkx.org|access-date=February 15, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1988, after completing most of the recording, Kravitz approached friend Stephen Elvis Smith, who had served as the music supervisor on [[Lisa Bonet]]'s ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' spin-off ''[[A Different World]]''. Smith had also worked with Kravitz's mother on the hit sitcom ''[[The Jeffersons]]''. Kravitz urged Smith to manage his career and assist him in finding a record deal. In less than a month of shopping the recordings, five labels (Warner Bros, Elektra, Geffen, Capitol, and Virgin) were in a bidding war for Kravitz. Eventually, a deal was made with Virgin Records in January 1989, and signed by Virgin A&R executive Nancy Jeffries. The label was \"excited\" about the music he was making, music inspired by his relationship with wife Bonet and their new daughter, Zoe. On Smith's urging, Kravitz dropped the name Romeo Blue and reclaimed the Lenny Kravitz moniker. About his time as Romeo Blue, Kravitz said, \"Ultimately, it got me back to myself. And when I finally did accept myself for myself, music started flowing out of me.\"<ref name=\"Henderson2002\"/>\n\nKravitz released his debut album ''[[Let Love Rule (Lenny Kravitz album)|Let Love Rule]]'' in 1989, a combination of rock and funk with a 1960s vibe. Music critics were mixed: some felt Kravitz was a gifted new artist, others felt he was overpowered by his musical influences. The album was a moderate success in the United States, but became an instant hit outside of the US, especially in Europe. Lisa Bonet directed the debut music video for the title track, \"Let Love Rule.\" Stephen Smith signed Kravitz with talent booking agency CAA, who soon were fielding offers for Kravitz, first on a club tour, and then in opening slots for [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers]], [[Bob Dylan]], and David Bowie. Having played essentially all of the instruments on the album, Kravitz had to quickly assemble a touring band to support the ''Let Love Rule'' release. In May 2009, a 20th anniversary deluxe edition of ''Let Love Rule'' was released worldwide by Virgin. Kravitz launched a LLR(20) tour of Europe and the United States in support of the re-release.<ref>\u00abC\u2019est chez vous que tout a commenc\u00e9 pour ma carri\u00e8re, raconte-t-il.

In 1995, Kravitz released the album ''[[Circus (Lenny Kravitz album)|Circus]]'', which went to number 10 on the ''Billboard'' chart on the back of his past achievement.

Recorded in both his own New York City carriage house, and [[Compass Point Studios]] in The [[Bahamas]], Kravitz employed engineer/producer [[Terry Manning]] to handle the recording duties. ''5'' introduced his music to an even wider audience thanks to the hit single \"[[Fly Away (Lenny Kravitz song)|Fly Away]]\" being featured prominently in both car manufacturer and airline commercials. ''5'' would reach number 28 on the ''Billboard'' 200, with \"Fly Away\" peaking at number twelve on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, topping both the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts, and also topping the charts in Iceland and the United Kingdom.

The album was recorded in Miami. Kravitz wrote the song \"Bank Robber Man\" after the [[Miami Police Department]] detained and cuffed him while walking to the gym with his trainer because police stated that he matched the description of a bank robber. Kravitz did not have any identification with him at the time and the police on the scene did not believe that he was indeed Lenny Kravitz. The bank teller who was robbed was then brought to the scene and said Kravitz was not the bank robber. Miami Police later sent officers to Kravitz's home to apologize for the detention. When asked if he thought the incident was a case of [[racial profiling]], Kravitz said he was not sure although some of the lyrics in the song suggest otherwise. The first single from the album, \"[[Dig In]],\" went to number 1 in Argentina and the top 10 in Italy and Portugal. The video for \"Dig In\" was originally supposed to be shot at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] on September 12, 2001 but the terrorist attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001 caused the location to be moved. The video was later shot off the coast of Miami. He won his fourth Grammy in [[Grammy Awards of 2002|2002]].<ref name=\"grammy\"/> \"Stillness of Heart,\" \"Believe in Me,\" and \"If I Could Fall In Love\" were subsequent singles from the album.\n\nKravitz was the subject of a photo book by former chief photographer for ''Rolling Stone'', [[Mark Seliger]].

Kravitz also appeared on ''Unity'', the official album of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]], and performed a cover of \"[[Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)]]\" on the album ''[[Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''.\n\nKravitz's seventh album ''[[Baptism (Lenny Kravitz album)|Baptism]]'' was released in May 2004. The first single was \"[[Where Are We Runnin'?]]\" The single \"California\" failed to be commercially successful, but \"Storm\", featuring [[Jay-Z]], reached the charts. \"Calling All Angels\" was successful in various countries and a huge hit in Brazil, however it was \"[[Lady (Lenny Kravitz song)|Lady]]\" that became the album's surprise hit, making the US Top 30 and propelling ''Baptism'' to gold status. Also in 2004, he appeared on [[N.E.R.D]]'s album ''[[Fly or Die]]''. From March 2005, Kravitz toured all over the world with the tour ''Electric Church'', which ended at the [[Brixton Academy]], London in July 2005.

The night before that tour started, October 29, 2005, Kravitz's father, TV producer Seymour \"Sy\" Kravitz, died. During that first show, Kravitz broke the news to the stunned crowd and stated it was not a time to be sad, but rather a time to celebrate because he is now in Heaven.
