Lennox stated that while on a trip to South Africa in December 2007 to appear at the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] campaign in Johannesburg, the regional company office of the label failed to return phone calls and e-mails she made to them for three weeks, and had completely failed to promote the Sing project as planned. Upon her return to the UK, Lennox met with the head of Sony BMG UK, Ged Docherty, who was \"mortified\" by the problems she had encountered with the South African branch. However, the debacle (partly inflamed when Lennox's dissatisfaction with the South African office was made public on her blog) led to press reports falsely stating that she was being dropped by Sony BMG. The record company themselves quickly refuted the rumour stating that Lennox's contract with them had merely been fulfilled and that they hoped she would consider remaining with them. The British tabloid, ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', subsequently printed a retraction of its story about her being dropped by the label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annielennox.com/news.php?newsItem=871 |title=Official press statement Jan 2008 |website=Annielennox.com |date=15 January 2008 |access-date=27 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707145210/http://www.annielennox.com/news.php?newsItem=871 |archive-date=7 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===2010\u20132013: Island Records and ''A Christmas Cornucopia''===\n{{main|A Christmas Cornucopia}}\n[[File:Annie Lennox SING campaign, Vienna 2010 b.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Lennox performing live in [[Vienna]] during the SING campaign, 2010]] \nIn August 2010, Lennox signed a new contract with [[Island Records]] in the UK and [[Decca Records]] in the US (both part of the [[Universal Music Group]]).<ref>[http://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/international-superstar-annie-lennox-signs-with-universal-music-group-umg-for-worldwide-re International Superstar Annie Lennox signs with Universal Music Group (UMG)] Universal Music.
