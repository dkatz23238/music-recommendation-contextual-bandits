Their next albums ''[[The Silent Force]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Heart of Everything]]'' (2007) debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts and expanded their international recognition. In 2008, they released ''[[Black Symphony]]'', a [[live album]] recorded with the [[Metropole Orkest|Metropole Orchestra]]. This was followed in 2009 by ''[[An Acoustic Night at the Theatre]]'', another live album, this time with [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] renditions of the songs.\n\nThe band's fifth studio album, ''[[The Unforgiving]]'', was released in March 2011 and was one part of a [[transmedia]] effort, alongside both a [[comic book]] series and a series of [[short film]]s that together encompass a [[Concept album|story]]. The album saw the band increasingly venturing on new musical territories outside symphonic metal. Their sixth studio album, ''[[Hydra (Within Temptation album)|Hydra]]'', was released in early 2014 in Japan, Europe, and the United States. The album advanced the band's exploration of new musical genres and features guest appearances from various artists: Finnish singer [[Tarja Turunen]], who appears in the lead single \"[[Paradise (What About Us?)]]\"; [[Howard Jones (American musician)|Howard Jones]], former vocalist of American metalcore band [[Killswitch Engage]]; [[Dave Pirner]], lead vocalist of American alternative rock band [[Soul Asylum]]; and American rapper [[Xzibit]].

Also subsequently Ivar de Graaf left the band and was replaced by Ciro Palma.<ref name=\"Sharpe-YoungPage294\"/>\n\nThe sound of ''Enter'', whilst melodic, was doomily paced, and influenced by gothic doom metal, heavily reliant on slow keyboards and drums and repetitive guitar riffs.<ref name=\"musicaldiscoveries\">{{cite web|last=Farrell|first=Charlie|title=Within Temptation at Musical Discoveries|url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/wt.htm|access-date=12 May 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"vpro\">{{cite web|last=Bijl|first=Peter|title=Utrechts metaltrots Orphanage uit elkaar|url=http://3voor12lokaal.vpro.nl/magazines/news/index.jsp?portals=6337&magazines=6338&news=202326|access-date=1 May 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060322145236/http://3voor12lokaal.vpro.nl/magazines/news/index.jsp?portals=6337&magazines=6338&news=202326 |archive-date = 22 March 2006}}</ref> Also prominent on this album are [[death grunts]] by Robert Westerholt and George Oosthoek, ex-member of [[Orphanage (band)|Orphanage]].\n\nIn 1998 the band continued to tour \u2013 their profile had elevated them to the main stage at ''Dynamo'' for the 1998 event. However, Within Temptation had released no new material (and did not have plans for a second album at this point), to which end they elected to release an [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[The Dance (EP)|The Dance]]'', with three songs (plus two remixes) that would further mature the sound from Enter.\n\nFinally taking a break from touring, 1999 was largely a sabbatical year for the band. They took the opportunity to construct their own studio, as well as returning to personal pursuits, with plans to return to the fold the next year.\n\n===''Mother Earth'' and national breakthrough (2000\u20132003)===\n{{Main|Mother Earth (Within Temptation album)}}\n2000 was an eventful year for the band as they returned to touring, playing three Dutch festivals; ''Waterpop'', ''Bospop'' and ''[[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands]]''.

Westerholt later started the band [[Delain]].\n\nIn 2002 they had their first concert in France and a headline gig in [[Mexico City]]. They attained their first major award, the Dutch ''Silver Harp''. They bolstered this by embarking on a major international tour supporting Paradise Lost in 2003 and re-releasing ''Mother Earth'' on the [[GUN Records]] label across more European countries; it was a success in Germany, where it went platinum and reached No. 7 in the charts; the re-release of \"Ice Queen\" also charted well in the top 30. In turn the [[Benelux]] regions got a different release, a cover of [[Kate Bush]]'s ''\"[[Running Up that Hill (EP)|Running Up that Hill]]\"''. The band headlined music festivals across the Netherlands, while their ''Mother Earth'' tour DVD claimed the prestigious [[The Edison Award|Edison Award]]. Promotion of ''Mother Earth'' in newer markets continued well into 2004 with various international festival appearances (such as [[M'era Luna]], [[Rock Werchter]], and [[Pukkelpop]]) and other headline gigs, which also saw the band make their [[United Kingdom|UK]] live debut in [[London]] in September of that year.\n\n===''The Silent Force'' and further recognition (2004\u20132006)===\n{{Main|The Silent Force|The Silent Force Tour (Within Temptation tour)}}\n[[Image:Within Temptation Metalway 2006 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The band presented at several big European festivals, which led the band to perform to great major audiences.]]\nPlans for the band's third album came to fruition in 2004, with the release of ''[[The Silent Force]]'' on 15 November 2004, across Europe.

The video, filmed in Romania, deals with child abuse, and sales of the single was to raise money for a children's charity, Child Helpline International. \"The Howling\" was chosen as a digital single release for the UK (not to be confused with the US EP release), and another video was also shot.
