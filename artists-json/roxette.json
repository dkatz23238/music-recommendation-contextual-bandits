There are millions of people out there who still love the band, so it's a matter of course for me to keep our music alive. At first I wasn't sure which way to go, but over time it became clear that I wanted to continue this fantastic \"pleasure trip\". I want to keep the Roxette legacy alive. I have written almost all the songs that Roxette recorded and they mean a lot to me. When I started writing, the ambition was to try and create a sibling to ''Look Sharp!'' and ''Joyride'', and that's exactly what it sounds like. I wanted to make a modern production, but based on the well-known Roxette stucco. It is impossible to replace Marie and that has never been my intention either. It was a fantastic time and dream that we were able to share together. But it feels exciting to be able to continue this journey, albeit in a different way. If Marie had been alive, of course we would have done this together. I feel this is the right decision. I am proud of all that Roxette has done and I love working with these people. \u201d\n\nIn September 2022 PG Roxette released a second single called \"Walking on Air\", from the forthcoming PG Roxette debut album called \"Pop-Up Dynamo!\" to be released 28 October 2022.\n\n== Awards ==\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1988\n|rowspan=2|''Look Sharp''\n|[[Grammis]] <small>(Sweden)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Composer of the Year <small>(Gessle)</small><ref name=grammis/>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[Rockbj\u00f6rnen]] <small>(Sweden)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Best Swedish Album<ref name=rockbjornen/>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Roxette\n|Rockbj\u00f6rnen <small>(Sweden)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Best Swedish Group<ref name=rockbjornen/>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1989\n| [[Smash Hits Poll Winners Party]]&nbsp;\u2013 Most Promising New Group\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2|\"The Look\"\n|[[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Award]] <small>(USA)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 International Viewer's Choice <small>(Europe)</small>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n| [[Music & Media|Music & Media Year-End Awards]] - Pan European Award<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1989/M&M-1989-12-23.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1989/M&M-1989-12-23.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=Music & Media|date=1989-12-23|website=Worldradiohistory.com|access-date=3 March 2022}}</ref>\n| {{draw|2nd place}}\n|-\n|rowspan=6|Roxette\n|Rockbj\u00f6rnen <small>(Sweden)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Best Swedish Group<ref name=rockbjornen/>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|Silver [[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]] Otto <small>(Germany)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Best rock/pop Group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravo-archiv.de/auswahl.php?link=ottosieger1989.php|title=Bravo magazine archive\u2013Otto awards 1989|work=[[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]]|access-date=2010-02-01|language=de}}</ref>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|1990\n|Bronze Bravo Otto&nbsp;\u2013 Best rock/pop group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravo-archiv.de/auswahl.php?link=ottosieger1990.php|title=Bravo magazine archive\u2013Otto awards 1990|work=Bravo|access-date=2010-02-01|language=de}}</ref>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7|1991\n|[[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] <small>(UK)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Best international group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/the-vaults/year/1991|title=1991 Brit Awards|publisher=[[Brit Awards]] ([[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]])|access-date=2010-11-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401135005/http://www.brits.co.uk/the-vaults/year/1991|archive-date=1 April 2012}}</ref>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Silver Bravo Otto&nbsp;\u2013 Best rock/pop group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravo-archiv.de/auswahl.php?link=ottosieger1991.php|title=Bravo magazine archive\u2013Otto awards 1991|work=Bravo|access-date=2010-02-01|language=de}}</ref>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|Rockbj\u00f6rnen <small>(Sweden)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Best Swedish Group<ref name=rockbjornen/>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|''Joyride''\n|Rockbj\u00f6rnen <small>(Sweden)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Best Swedish Album<ref name=rockbjornen/>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|Grammis&nbsp;\u2013 Pop Group of the Year<ref name=grammis/>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|\"Joyride\"\n|MTV Video Award&nbsp;\u2013 International Viewer's Choice <small>(Europe)</small>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Roxette\n|Australian Music Awards&nbsp;\u2013 Most Popular International Group\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=4|1992\n|Gold Bravo Otto&nbsp;\u2013 Best rock/pop Group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravo-archiv.de/auswahl.php?link=ottosieger1992.php|title=Bravo magazine archive\u2013Otto awards 1992|work=Bravo|access-date=2010-02-01|language=de}}</ref>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|Rockbj\u00f6rnen <small>(Sweden)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Best Swedish Group<ref name=rockbjornen/>\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|\"Joyride\"\n|[[Juno Award]] <small>(Canada)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 Best Selling Single by a Foreign Artist<ref name=juno92/>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Roxette\n|[[Echo (music award)|Echo]] <small>(Germany)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 International Group of the Year<ref name=echo/>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1993\n|Echo <small>(Germany)</small>&nbsp;\u2013 International Group of the Year<ref name=echo/>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n| ''[[Join the Joyride!
