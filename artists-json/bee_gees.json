The young brothers began performing to raise pocket money. [[Dirt track racing|Speedway]] promoter and driver Bill Goode, who had hired the brothers to entertain the crowd at the Redcliffe Speedway in 1960, introduced them to Brisbane radio-presenter jockey Bill Gates. The crowd at the speedway would throw money onto the track for the boys, who generally performed during the interval of meetings (usually on the back of a truck that drove around the track) and, in a deal with Goode, any money they collected from the crowd they were allowed to keep. Gates named the group the \"BGs\" (later changed to \"Bee Gees\") after his, Goode's and Barry Gibb's initials.

At this time the brothers met the American-born songwriter, producer and entrepreneur [[Nat Kipner]], who had just been appointed A&R manager of a new independent [[music label|label]], [[Spin Records (Australian Label)|Spin Records]].

The brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that could replicate their studio sound. Lead guitarist [[Alan Kendall]] had come on board in 1971 but did not have much to do until ''Mr. Natural''. For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-[[Strawbs]] keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the Bee Gees band that lasted through the late '70s.

The movie had been heavily promoted prior to release and was expected to enjoy great commercial success. However, it was savaged by film critics as a disjointed mess and ignored by the public. Though some of its tracks charted, the soundtrack too was a high-profile flop. The single \"[[Oh!
