Formed in 1998, the band consisted of [[Jenny Lewis]], [[Blake Sennett]], [[#Band members|Pierre de Reeder]], and [[#Band members|Dave Rock]].\n\nThe group released their debut album ''[[Take-Offs and Landings]]'' under [[Seattle]]-based independent label [[Barsuk Records]] in 2001.<ref name=\"MTV Bio\">{{cite web|title=Rilo Kiley: Full Biography |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/rilo_kiley/artist.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081818/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/rilo_kiley/artist.jhtml |archive-date=2011-06-05 |publisher=MTV |access-date=2017-12-09}}</ref>  After that, they released three additional studio albums and several [[extended play|EPs]].

The band signed with independent label [[Barsuk Records]] for its first full-length album, ''[[Take-Offs and Landings]]'', in 2001. The band later signed with Omaha's [[Saddle Creek Records]] and released ''[[The Execution of All Things]]'' in 2002. In 2004, it released ''[[More Adventurous]]'' on its own imprint, Brute/Beaute Records, which was distributed by major label [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The band later signed directly with Warner Bros.\n\n2004 saw a great increase in recognition for the band, as Sennett and Boesel released an album with their band [[The Elected]] and Lewis sang backup on [[The Postal Service]]'s ''[[Give Up]]''. Lewis toured with The Postal Service before heading out on two tours in support of Rilo Kiley's ''More Adventurous'' in the summer and fall of 2004. The album spent late 2004 high on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Heatseekers Chart, and was promoted with appearances on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. The band opened for [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]] on the international leg of [[Conor Oberst]]'s tour for 2005's ''[[I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning]]'' and was the opening act for the North American dates of [[Coldplay]]'s Twisted Logic Tour in Fall 2005. \"I Never\" and \"Ripchord\" (from ''[[More Adventurous]])'' have been featured in several feature films, including ''[[Must Love Dogs]]'', ''[[Conversations with Other Women]]'', and ''[[John Tucker Must Die]]''.\n\nThe band's fourth album ''[[Under the Blacklight]]'' was released August 20, 2007 in the United Kingdom<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/rilo-kiley/28267 |title=Rilo Kiley return with new record &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2007-05-10 |access-date=2012-02-19}}</ref> and the following day in the United States.<ref>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/43379-rilo-kiley-reveal-iblacklighti-tracklist-us-release-date Pitchfork: Rilo Kiley Reveal Blacklight Tracklist, U.S. Release Date] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606210712/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/43379-rilo-kiley-reveal-iblacklighti-tracklist-us-release-date |date=June 6, 2007 }}</ref> Its first single is \"The Moneymaker\".

On this tour, it was joined by [[Orenda Fink]] (of [[Azure Ray]]) and [[Kristin Gundred]] (of [[Grand Ole Party]] and [[Dum Dum Girls]]).\n\nThe group was also known for its charitable contributions, particularly to the [[Elliott Smith]] Memorial Fund, in honor of the late singer and friend of the band. Sennett and Lewis participated in a memorial concert for the singer shortly after his death in 2003. In 2007, the band contributed a t-shirt, which was designed by de Reeder for the [[Yellow Bird Project]] to benefit the Elliott Smith Memorial Fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2007/01/bands-design-t-shirts-charity-benefit/|title=Bands Design T-Shirts for Charity Benefit|publisher=SPIN Magazine |date=2007-01-31 |access-date=2017-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Hiatus and breakup===\nIn a 2010 interview with ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', Jason Boesel said the band was taking a break but working on a compilation of unreleased songs. He also said there were no plans to release a new album in the near future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/02/new-jenny-lewis-and-rilo-kiley-albums-in-the-works.html |title=New Jenny Lewis and Rilo Kiley Albums in the Works, Says Jason Boesel :: Music :: News :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date=2010-02-05 |access-date=2012-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn an April 2011 interview, Blake Sennett said,\"I would say that if Rilo Kiley were ... hmmm ... a human being ... hmmm ... he's probably laying on his back in a morgue with a tag on his toe. Now, I see movies where the dead get up and walk. And when they do that, rarely do good things happen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/04/blake-sennett-discusses-the-elected-the-possible-end-of-rilo-kiley-and-more/2/ |title=Blake Sennett discusses The Elected, the possible end of Rilo Kiley, and more \u00ab Consequence of Sound |publisher=Consequenceofsound.net |date=2011-04-14 |access-date=2012-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, when asked about his \"corpse\" comment and whether Rilo Kiley was indeed dead, Sennett said \"I never say never. I loved Rilo Kiley\u2014I loved writing with Jenny. I think she's a great artist and great to write with. I think we're not there yet. Maybe one day we'll dust it off and give it a go; I'd be open to it. I think it was fun\u2014for all of the pitfalls, it was great. I had a great time in Rilo Kiley. I always did.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=District |first=The |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/06/catching-up-with-blake-sennett.html |title=Catching Up With Blake Sennett :: Music :: Features :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date=2011-06-17 |access-date=2012-02-19}}</ref>\n\nA month later Sennett told AOL Spinner: \"I said, 'Fuck that, I can't do this anymore.' That being said, it was probably immature and that came from a place of ego. I think that stuff will rear its head in anything you do, depending on the personnel you surround yourself with; things change overtime {{sic}} and people change and relationships change.\"\n\nIn February 2013, the band announced a collection of previously released rarities and unreleased material, titled ''[[Rkives]]'', to be released in April 2013 on DeReeder's own label the Little Record Company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/49016-rilo-kiley-almost-finished-archival-project-not-releasing-album-of-new-material|title=Rilo Kiley Almost Finished Archival Project, Not Releasing Album of New Material|publisher=Pitchfork |date=2012-12-28 |access-date=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2014 interview with the National Post, Jenny Lewis confirmed the band had officially broken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/30/national-post-sessions-jenny-lewis-on-flying-solo-feminism-and-her-playful-single-one-of-the-guys/|title=Jenny Lewis talks breaking up the band, messaging Ryan Adams on Twitter and dealing with insomnia|publisher=National Post|date=2014-07-30|access-date=2014-07-30|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140806184422/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/30/national-post-sessions-jenny-lewis-on-flying-solo-feminism-and-her-playful-single-one-of-the-guys/|archive-date=2014-08-06}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, Blake Sennett joined Jenny Lewis and her band on stage at Coachella for a performance of Rilo Kiley song \"[[Portions for Foxes]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2015/04/12/coachella-2015-jenny-lewis-set-features-mini-rilo-kiley-reunion/|title=Coachella 2015: Jenny Lewis set features mini Rilo Kiley reunion|date=2015-04-12|work=Pasadena Star News|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSince embarking on a solo career, Jenny Lewis has enlisted the help of drummer Jason Boesel for percussion on studio recordings. He was also part of Lewis' live band for her 2019 tour.\n\n==Television appearances==\n[[Image:Rilo-kiley.jpg|thumb|left|2004 live performance]]\n\nThe band's songs have frequently been used on television programs, such as ''[[The O.C.]]'' and ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''. The apparent first use of Rilo Kiley music on a television show was also the last time that Blake Sennett and Jenny Lewis acted on television. In 2000, they played fictionalized versions of themselves (and the band performed \"The Frug\") on ABC's short-lived drama ''Once & Again''. Both \"The Frug\" and \"85\" were used during a third season episode of ''Dawson's Creek'' (#46, \"Barefoot At Capefest\"). \"Pictures of Success\" was used in episode No.&nbsp;114 of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy The Vampire Slayer]]'', entitled \"[[Older and Far Away]]\". The song \"Breakin' Up\" was featured in a fourth season episode of  ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. In 2005, \"Portions For Foxes\" was used in the pilot of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' and in 2009, the song was used in the seventh episode of season one of ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'', \"Echoes\". \"With Arms Outstretched\" was used at the end of the pilot episode of ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' in 2005 and to bring the show full circle, it was the final song played in the series finale in 2012. For a second-season episode of ''Weeds'', Lewis sang the theme song (\"[[Little Boxes]]\") with [[Johnathan Rice]] who was touring with the band. \"Silver Lining\" was featured in the pilot of ''[[Women's Murder Club (TV series)|Women's Murder Club]]''. The song was also used in the second season of ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]''. \"The Moneymaker\" was used on an episode of ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' that aired on December 11, 2007 and on an episode of ''[[Samantha Who?]]'' that aired on April 16, 2009. \"The Good That Won't Come Out\" was featured in the background of the Season 4 Episode 4 episode of ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' \"Hysterical Blindness\" on 10/12/2009. Their song \"A Better Son/Daughter\" was featured in the trailer for the Netflix original series [[Orange Is the New Black|''Orange is the New Black'']]. It is also featured at the end of [[Hannah Gadsby]]'s 2018 Netflix special [[Nanette]]. Rilo Kiley's song \"The Execution Of All Things\" also featured in Episode 4, Season 4 of ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]''. Their song \"Go Ahead\" was featured throughout the movie, ''Very Good Girls''.\n\n== Origin of the band's name ==\nOn the syndicated radio show ''[[Loveline]]'' in August 2005, Sennett explained that he had a dream in which he was being chased by a sports almanac: \"when it got me, I leafed through it...and I came upon an [[Australian rules football]] player from the 19th century named Rilo Kiley. It's kind of embarrassing.\" When asked by co-host [[Drew Pinsky]] if he had ever seen this name in reality, Sennett said \"I don't think so, I don't think that character exists...If you Google 'Rilo Kiley' you just come back with a lot of pictures of us.\" On how this imaginary name became the name for the band: \"I wrote it down on a blotter, an office desk when I woke up, and, I don't know, I came back to it when we were trying to think of a name and we thought we'd use that for one show then change it, 'cause who'd want that name? Who can remember that anyway?\"<ref>http://www.whysanity.net/wikipedia/loveline_rilo_kiley.mp3 {{Bare URL AV media|date=June 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Sennett told ''[[Planet Sound]] Teletext Magazine'' that the name came from a Scottish athlete. On a 2005 episode of the [[MSNBC]] entertainment show ''[[MSNBC Entertainment Hot List]]'', the female host stated that the name came from \"old Scottish sports almanacs\". In the interview segment that followed, Sennett stated \"We just looked in there and the name of one of the star players from the turn of the century was Rilo Kiley.\"\n\nIn an interview published in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine in September 2007, Sennett stated that Rilo Kiley is named after a character he'd met in a dream who had predicted the date of Jenny Lewis' death.\n\n==Band members==\n* [[Jenny Lewis]] \u2013 [[lead singer|vocals]], keyboards, guitar, bass guitar (1998\u20132013)\n* [[Blake Sennett]] \u2013 guitar, keyboards, vocals (1998\u20132013)\n* [[Mike Bloom (musician)|Mike Bloom]] - pedal steel, guitars (2004\u20132005)\n* Pierre de Reeder \u2013 bass guitar, guitar, backing vocals (1998\u20132013)\n* [[Jason Boesel]] \u2013 drums, percussion (2001\u20132013)\n* Dave Rock \u2013 drums, percussion (1998\u20132001)\n\n==Discography==\n{{main article|Rilo Kiley discography}}\n<!-- Studio albums only -->\n* ''[[Take Offs and Landings]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[The Execution of All Things]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[More Adventurous]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Under the Blacklight]]'' (2007)\n\n==Videography==\n* \"[[Desert Blue|The Frug]]\" (1999, directed by [[Morgan J.
