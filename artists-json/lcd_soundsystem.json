The band comprises Murphy (vocals, various instruments), Nancy Whang (synthesizer, keyboards, vocals), Pat Mahoney (drums), Tyler Pope (bass, guitar, synthesizer), [[Al Doyle]] (guitar, synthesizer, percussion), Matt Thornley (guitar, synthesizer, percussion), and Korey Richey (synthesizer, piano, percussion). They are currently signed to both DFA and [[Columbia Records]].\n\nThe band began by recording and releasing multiple singles from 2002 to 2004, the first of which was \"[[Losing My Edge]]\", one of their [[signature song]]s. This led up to the release of their 2005 [[LCD Soundsystem (album)|self-titled debut studio album]]. It garnered critical acclaim and a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Electronic/Dance Album]]. Their single \"[[Daft Punk Is Playing at My House]]\", which has become the band's most commercially successful single, received a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]]. In the following year, LCD Soundsystem recorded and released \"[[45:33]]\", a forty-five minute-long composition that was a specially made \"workout track\" for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] ''Nike+ Original Run'' series. In 2007, the band released their second studio album, ''[[Sound of Silver]]'', to critical acclaim and another Grammy nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album.\n\nIn 2010, LCD Soundsystem released their third studio album, ''[[This Is Happening]]'', which became their first top-ten album in the United States. In February 2011, the band posted a statement on its website announcing that it was disbanding following a large farewell concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] on April 2, 2011. The farewell concert is chronicled in the documentary film ''[[Shut Up and Play the Hits]]'' and was also made available as a live album titled ''[[The Long Goodbye: LCD Soundsystem Live at Madison Square Garden|The Long Goodbye]]'', in April 2014.\n\nAfter a series of rumors hinting at a possible reunion, in December 2015 the band released their first single in five years, \"[[Christmas Will Break Your Heart]]\". LCD Soundsystem later confirmed their reunion and announced an expanded tour, including appearances at several high-profile music festivals, and released their fourth studio album ''[[American Dream (LCD Soundsystem album)|American Dream]]'' in September 2017. It went on to become their first number-one album in the United States. The album was nominated for [[Best Alternative Music Album]] at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]] and the single \"[[Tonite (LCD Soundsystem song)|Tonite]]\" won for Best Dance Recording.\n\n==History==\n===Early singles and self-titled album (2002\u20132005)===\n{{Main|LCD Soundsystem (album)}}\n[[File:LCD Soundsystem Hyde Park Wireless Festival (27922010).jpg|thumb|LCD Soundsystem performing in Madrid in 2005|262px]]\n[[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]] founded LCD Soundsystem during 2002<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/lcd-soundsystem/29525428 |title=LCD Soundsystem |website=[[Apple Music]] |access-date=February 10, 2019}}</ref> in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Brooklyn]].<ref name=\"Billboard Miller\">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/7341761//coachella-2016-friday-weekend-2-prince-tributes-lcd-soundsystem-jack-u-ellie-goulding | title=Coachella 2016 Friday Weekend 2 Recap: Prince Tributes by LCD Soundsystem, Jack U, Ellie Goulding & More | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=April 23, 2016 | access-date=April 23, 2016 | author=Miller, Jeff | archive-date=April 23, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423133627/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/7341761//coachella-2016-friday-weekend-2-prince-tributes-lcd-soundsystem-jack-u-ellie-goulding | url-status=dead }}</ref> The \"LCD\" part of the band's name stands for \"Liquid Christmas Display\", a play on \"[[liquid-crystal display]]\", and originated from the earliest iteration of the band during a live performance at a Brooklyn Christmas party where bassist Murphy and drummer Pat Mahoney were covering songs by [[Liquid Liquid]].<ref>{{cite podcast |url=https://thebestshow.libsyn.com/james-murphy-of-lcd-soundsystem-in-studio-a-call-from-thor-more |title=JAMES MURPHY OF LCD SOUNDSYSTEM IN STUDIO!
