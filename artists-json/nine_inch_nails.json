Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer [[Trent Reznor]] was the only permanent member of the band until his frequent collaborator, [[Atticus Ross]], joined in 2016. The band's debut album, ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989), was released via [[TVT Records]]. After disagreeing with TVT about how to promote the album, the band signed with [[Interscope Records]] and released the EP [[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|''Broken'']] (1992). The following albums, ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Fragile]]'' (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released the album ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005). Following the release of the album [[Year Zero (album)|''Year Zero'']] (2007), the band left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'' (2008) and [[The Slip (album)|''The Slip'']] (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'' (2013), was followed by a trilogy which consisted of the EPs ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016) and ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017) and their ninth album ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails simultaneously released two further instalments in the ''Ghosts'' series: ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' and ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]]''.\n\nWhen touring, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him under the Nine Inch Nails name. This live band has varied over the decades, with various members leaving and returning; the most recent lineup consists of [[Robin Finck]] (who initially joined in 1994), [[Alessandro Cortini]] (who initially joined in 2005), and [[Ilan Rubin]] (who initially joined in 2009) alongside Reznor and Ross. [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|The band's concerts]] are noted for their extensive use of thematic visual elements, complex special effects, and elaborate lighting. Songs are often rearranged to fit any given performance, and melodies or lyrics of songs that are not scheduled to be performed are sometimes assimilated into other songs.\n\nNine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and been nominated for 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning for the songs [[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|\"Wish\"]] in 1992 and \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\" in 1996. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine named Reznor one of its most influential people in 1997, while ''Spin'' magazine has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]]. Nine Inch Nails were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2020, after being nominated in 2014 (their first year of eligibility) and again in 2015.\n\n==History==\n=== Formation (1987\u20131988) ===\n[[File:Nine Inch Nails logo.svg|thumb|right|alt=The letters N, I, and a backwards N set in a strong typeface within a simple black border.|The band's logo, designed by Reznor and [[Gary Talpas]]]]\n\nWhile living in [[Cleveland]] in 1987, [[Trent Reznor]] played keyboards in the [[Exotic Birds]], a [[synthpop]] band managed by [[John Malm Jr.]]<ref name=\"NIN Spin 1996\">{{Cite magazine|last= Weisbard|first= Eric|date=February 1996|title=Sympathy for the Devil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&pg=PA34 |volume=11|issue=11|pages=34\u201342, 96|issn=0886-3032|access-date=August 27, 2018|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |via= Google Books}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Reznor became friends with Malm,{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=33}} who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music.<ref>''Reznor v.
