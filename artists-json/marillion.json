Both were recorded at [[The Enid]]'s studio in Hertfordshire.

At the end of the day the band would have needed a \u00a314,000 loan from EMI as tour support to do it.

Fish would later disclose in the liner notes to the 2-CD reissue of ''Clutching at Straws'' that he and his former bandmates had met up and discussed the demise of the band and renewed their friendship, and had come to the consensus that an excessive touring schedule and too much pressure from the band's management led to the rift.\n\nAlthough reportedly now on good personal terms, both camps had always made it very clear that the oft-speculated-upon reunion would never happen. However, when Fish headlined the 'Hobble on the Cobbles' free concert in Aylesbury's Market Square on 26 August 2007, the attraction of playing their debut single in its spiritual home proved strong enough to overcome any lingering bad feeling between the former band members, and Kelly, Mosley, Rothery, and Trewavas replaced Fish's backing band for an emotional encore of \"Market Square Heroes\".\n\nIn a press interview following the event, Fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, saying that: \"[[Steve Hogarth|Hogarth]] does a great job with the band. We forged different paths over the 19 years.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6966603.stm|title= Singer Fish and Marillion reunite| date=28 August 2007|work=BBC News }}</ref>\n\n===The Steve Hogarth era===\n====''Seasons End'' and ''Holidays in Eden'' (1989\u20131992)====\nAfter the split, the band found Steve Hogarth, the former keyboardist and vocalist of [[The Europeans (band)|the Europeans]] and the duo [[How We Live]].

Hogarth was a significant contrast to Fish, coming from a [[New wave music|new wave]] musical background instead of progressive rock. He had also never owned a Marillion album before joining the band.<ref name=Ling2001/>\n\nAfter Fish left the group (taking his lyrics with him), Hogarth set to work crafting new lyrics to existing songs with lyricist and author [[John Helmer (musician)|John Helmer]]. The demo sessions of the songs from ''Seasons End'' with Fish vocals and lyrics can be found on the bonus disc of the remastered version of ''Clutching at Straws'', while the lyrics found their way into various Fish solo albums such as his first solo album, ''[[Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors]]'', some snippets on his second, ''[[Internal Exile (Fish album)|Internal Exile]]'' and even a line or two found its way to his third album, ''[[Suits (album)|Suits]]''.\n\nThe first time Marillion would appear in public with Steve Hogarth as the new singer was, under the banner of Low Fat Youghurts, at the Crooked Billet pub in [[Stoke Row]], on 8 June 1989. Only about 100 fans attended that Crooked Billet show, considerably more at Hogarths official introduction to fans at the recording of the promo video for ''[[Hooks in You]]'' at London's [[Brixton Academy]] on 1 August that year, and even more at the [[Palais des Sports (Besan\u00e7on)|Palais des Sports]] in Besan\u00e7on, France on 5 October following the release of ''Seasons End''. Marillion ended 1989 with their traditional Christmas show at London's [[Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]], and kicked off 26 January 1990 with the ''Seasons End'' world tour, in front of 180,000 people at [[Hollywood Rock]] Festival in Rio de Janeiro, then rolling through Canada and North America before returning to Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-01|title=the-band-that-refuses-to-die|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-rise-and-rise-of-marillion-the-band-that-refuses-to-die}}</ref> The tour would prove to be the longest that Hogarth has thus far undertaken with Marillion. Although the tour wouldn't end in the UK until July, that Marillion ended the ''Seasons End'' tour in the UK at [[Wembley Arena]] highlighted how successful the shift from Fish to the new frontman Hogarth had been.<ref name=\"Ewing\">{{Cite journal|last=Ewing|first=Jerry|date=March 2010|title=Marillion History|journal=Classic Rock Presents Prog}}</ref>\n\nHogarth's second album with the band, ''[[Holidays in Eden (Album)|Holidays in Eden]]'', was the first he wrote in partnership with the band from the beginning, and includes the song \"Dry Land\", which Hogarth had written and recorded with his earlier duo, How We Live. As quoted from Steve Hogarth, \"''Holidays in Eden'' was to become Marillion's \"pop\"est album ever, and was greeted with delight by many, and dismay by some of the hardcore fans\".  EMI also wanted Marillon to deliver three hit singles from the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/holidays.htm |title=MUSIC \u2013 Discography \u2013 Holidays in Eden |website=Marillion.com |access-date=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nMarillion returned to their pseudonym Low Fat Youghurts in December 1990 to preview their forthcoming album at the Moles club in Bath. ''Holidays in Eden'' wouldn't be released until June 1991, and was followed by a headlining appearance at the second and final Cumbria Rock Festival at [[Derwent Park]] in Workington 13 July 1991. The Cumbria appearance kick-started another lengthy world tour that would see the band course through the UK, before venturing through Europe and returning to the UK for some Christmas shows. In the beginning of 1992 the band built their own recording and rehearsal studio, The Racket Club, in Buckinghamshire. March and April 1992 saw Marillion back out across Canada and America. They returned to UK for an exclusive, intimate show at London's Borderline for members of their The Web fan club to celebrate the band's 10th Anniversary on 9 May 1992. This show was the first 'official bootleg' live-CD released in August on their own new started Racket Records label, a limited edition of 2000 copies, before venturing off again through Europe. EMI also released the compilation album ''[[A Singles Collection]] - Six of One, Half A Dozen of the Other'' to celebrate the band's tenth anniversary with the label. It also included two new recordings, a cover of [[Rare Bird|Rare Birds]] ''[[Sympathy (Rare Bird song)|Sympathy]]'' and ''I Will Walk on Water''. ''Sympathy'' was also released as a single and it reached No.17 in the UK charts, the first time the band had been inside the top 20 since ''Incommunicado''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Jon|title=Separated Out|publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing Ltd.|year=2002|pages=113\u2013114}}</ref>\n\nMarillon returned to the UK to headline the Wembley Arena on 5 September 1992, for what would be the final time for the band. The 1992 tour wound up in Baltimore, USA on 23 October. Marillion would only play just one gig in 1993, a fan club gig at Tivoli Theatre in Utrecht on 19 June, as a duo with only Hogarth and Trewavas. Marillion were busy readying what might become one of the most important albums of their career.<ref name=\"Ewing\" />\n\n====''Brave'', ''Afraid of Sunlight'' and split with EMI Records (1993\u20131995)====\n''Holidays in Eden'' was followed by ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'', a dark and richly complex [[concept album]] that took the band 18 months to write and record. The album also marked the start of the band's longtime relationship with producer [[Dave Meegan]]. \n\n''Brave'' was released on 7 February 1994. Some of the material had been aired at that sole 1993 show in Utrecht, and was also previewed at low-key gigs in the Netherlands, Italy, and Germany before Marillion kicked off the ''Brave'' world tour at Liverpool's [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Royal Court Theatre]] on 20 February. The ''Brave'' tour was another lengthy one, and the band undertook the move to perform the whole of their new album in its entirety (as they had done with ''Misplaced Childhood'' just under a decade earlier). However, this meant the inevitable relegating of some Fish-era songs from the set. After a series of summer shows in Japan, the ''Brave'' tour wound its way down to Mexico in September. An independent [[Brave (1994 film)|film]] based on the album, which featured the band, was also released in February 1995. The film was directed by [[Richard Stanley (director)|Richard Stanley]]. The band had already returned to studio work on what would become [[Afraid of Sunlight|their next studio album]] released in the summer of 1995.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ewing|first=Jerry|date=March 2010|title=Marillion History|url=|journal=Classic Rock Presents Prog}}</ref>\n\n''[[Afraid of Sunlight]]'' would be the band's last album with record label EMI Records. Once again, it received limited promotion, no mainstream radio airplay and its sales were disappointing for the band. Despite this, it was one of their most critically acclaimed albums and was included in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'''s 50 Best Albums of 1995.<ref>''Q'', February 1996.</ref> One track of note on the album is ''Out of This World'', a song about [[Donald Campbell]], who died while trying to set a speed record on water. The song inspired an effort to recover both Campbell's body and the \"Bluebird K7,\" the boat which Campbell crashed in, from the water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/lyrics/aos.htm#ootw |title=Out of this World, Trivia |website=Marillion.com |access-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824163846/http://www.marillion.com/music/lyrics/aos.htm#ootw |archive-date=24 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The recovery was finally undertaken in 2001, and both Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery were invited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/news/2001/20010308.htm |title=Band Member Journal : A Day in the Lakes |website=Marillion.com |date=8 March 2001 |access-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914022052/http://www.marillion.com/news/2001/20010308.htm |archive-date=14 September 2011 }}</ref> In 1998, Steve Hogarth said this was the best album he had made with the band.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/aos.htm | title= Afraid of Sunlight Sleeve Notes|website=Marillion.com}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 August 1995, Marillion began their ''Afraid of Sunlight'' tour in USA at the Bayou in Washington DC.

The first album to be released through Castle was the live double CD ''[[Made Again]]''. Not only did it release Marillion from its obligations with EMI (as the fifth album in a five-album deal), as well as paying off the debts without creating new ones, it marked a certain symmetry with the first seven years of the band. Mark Kelly noted: \"Our first four studio albums were followed by a double live album that signalled the end of a chapter. Now, after another four studio albums, followed by a live album, we move from EMI.\" Featuring ''Brave'' in its entirety, ''Made Again'' was released 25 March 1996 as the final EMI-era Marillion release in the UK, with Castle handling the release in mainland Europe and the US.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Jon|title=Separated Out Marillion History 1979-2002|publisher=Helter Skelter|year=2003|pages=138}}</ref> The release was followed by a brief tour with four dates in Europe at the end of April.\n\nIn the months prior, Rothery, Hogarth and Mosley used the break from Marillion to record separate solo projects. Mosley's project, IRIS, with French guitarist Sylvian Gouvernaire and Trewavas, released ''Crossing the Desert,'' on 22 April 1996. Rothery's project with the female singer Hannah Stobart, drummer Paul Craddick (from [[Enchant (band)|Enchant]]) and Trewavas, called [[The Wishing Tree (band)|The Wishing Tree]], released their album ''[[Carnival of Souls (The Wishing Tree album)|Carnival of Souls]]'' in September 1996. Hogarth released his solo album ''[[Ice Cream Genius]]'' in February 1997.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Jon|title=Separated Out Marillion History 1979-2002|publisher=Helter Skelter|year=2003}}</ref>\n\n''[[This Strange Engine (Album)|This Strange Engine]]'' was the following Marillion album released in April 1997 in the UK, and in October in the US, with limited promotion from their new label Castle. Marillion could not afford to make tour stops in the United States. Their dedicated US fan base decided to solve the problem by raising some $60,000 themselves online to give to the band to come to the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/press/anorak.htm |title=NEWS \u2013 Press Room \u2013 Anoraknophobia |website=Marillion.com |access-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914094146/http://www.marillion.com/press/anorak.htm |archive-date=14 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The band's loyal fanbase (combined with the Internet) would eventually become vital to their existence. Following the completion of the extensive 1997 tour (including Marillion's one-thousandth gig, on 27 October at the Amsterdam [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]]), the band returned to their own studio, The Racket Club, in November.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Jon|title=Separated Out Marillion History 1979-2002|publisher=Helter Skelter|year=2003|pages=158}}</ref>\n\nThe band's tenth album, ''[[Radiation (Marillion album)|Radiation]],'' released on 21 September 1998'','' saw them taking a different approach and was received by fans with mixed reactions.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> The short Radiation tour, with only dates in the UK and mainland Europe, ended on 18 November 1998 at the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Montmartre]] in Paris.\n\n''[[marillion.com]]'' was the follow-up, released on 18 October 1999, and showed progression in a new musical direction. However, the band were still unhappy with their record label situation. Under the terms of the deal, this was to be the third and final album distributed on the Castle label. The Dot Com tour, again with dates only in the UK and mainland Europe, started on 13 October at the MCM Cafe in Paris, and ended with a special Christmas show for the Web fanclubs worldwide in Aachen, Germany on 5 December 1999. For the whole of 2000, the band were writing [[Anoraknophobia|the next album]] at the Racket Club and in November 2000 they played 2 Charity gigs at [[Bass Brewery|Bass]] Museum in Burton-on-Trent, before playing some more Christmas shows for their European fan clubs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Jon|title=Separated Out Marillion History 1979-2002|publisher=Helter Skelter|year=2003|pages=175}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-01|title=morain.de|url=https://www.morain.de/Marillion/01Main-Topic03-Missing-Setlists-1999-2000.html}}</ref> Marillion needed a new strategy, and following the release of three albums via Castle, they came up with a novel approach for their next album.\n\n====''Anoraknophobia'' and ''Marbles'' (2000\u20132006)====\nThe band decided that they would try a radical experiment by asking their fans if they would help fund the recording of the next album by pre-ordering it before recording even started. The result was 12,674 pre-orders which raised enough money to record and release ''[[Anoraknophobia]]'' in the beginning of May 2001. As a 'thank-you' gesture to the fans who pre-ordered it, their names were credited in the sleeve notes and the pre-order \"Special Edition\" came in a deluxe 48-page hard-bound case with an extra enhanced CD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/anorak.htm |title=MUSIC \u2013 Discography \u2013 Anoraknophobia |website=Marillion.com |access-date=19 August 2011}}</ref> The band was able to strike a deal with EMI to also help distribute the album. This allowed Marillion to retain all the rights to their music while enjoying commercial distribution. The band went on tour which started in May 2001. A second leg of the tour (with a setlist largely decided by a poll of the fans) reached places that had never been played before, such as in the Azores at [[Ponta Delgada]] 22 September 2001. A US Tour was still not a possibility.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Jon|title=Separated Out Marillion History 1979-2002|publisher=Helter Skelter|year=2003|pages=189}}</ref> A 4-part BBC documentary 'The Future Just Happened' aired in the UK on BBC2 in the Summer 2001.

The band decided to book out a holiday camp and invite their fanbase to enjoy three entire days of Marillion with three concerts, signing sessions, and more. The hallmark of the weekend was the first night which hosts the entire rendition of an album of Marillion's choice. The Marillion weekends began at [[Pontins|Pontin]]'s Holiday Park, Brean Sands in the West Country, to which fans would fly in from all over the world.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-16|title=we-went-to-the-marillion-weekender-and-this-is-what-happened|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/we-went-to-the-marillion-weekender-and-this-is-what-happened}}</ref> In March 2003 they continued and held the Marillion weekend at [[Butlin's Minehead]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-16|title=marillion.com/tour/setlist|url=https://www.marillion.com/tour/setlist.htm?tourid=18&archive=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-16|title=marillionvod|url=https://marillionvod.uscreen.io/categories/wish-you-were-here}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Anoraknophobia'' allowed the band to start recording their next album, but they decided to leverage their fanbase once again to help raise money towards marketing and promotion of a new album. The band put up the album for pre-order in mid-production. This time fans responded by pre-ordering 18,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/marbles.htm |title=MUSIC \u2013 Discography \u2013 Marbles |website=Marillion.com |access-date=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n''[[Marbles (album)|Marbles]]'' was released in the end of April 2004 with a 2-CD version that was only available at Marillion's website. The pre-order version (known as the Deluxe Campaign Edition) of Marbles was packaged as a 128-page hard-bound book, packed in a rigid slip case. Those who purchased the Deluxe Campaign Edition by the end of 31 December 2003 were directly helping the Campaign Fund, and as a \"Thank You\" their name was printed in the album credits (like with the previous album, ''Anoraknophobia'').<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-01|title=marillion.com|url=https://www.marillion.com/news/newsitem.htm?id=38}}</ref>\n[[Image:MarillionEmpik2007.jpg|thumb|275px|right| Marillion in 2007, left to right: Steve Rothery, Steve Hogarth, Pete Trewavas (front row), Mark Kelly, Ian Mosley (back row)]] The band's management organised the biggest promotional schedule since they had left EMI and Steve Hogarth secured interviews with prominent broadcasters on [[BBC Radio]], including [[Matthew Wright (television presenter)|Matthew Wright]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]], [[Stuart Maconie]], [[Simon Mayo]] and [[Mark Lawson]].

Aware that it was unlikely to gain much mainstream radio airplay, the band released the single in three separate formats and encouraged fans to buy a copy of each to get the single into the UK Top Ten. The single reached No.&nbsp;7, making it the first Marillion song to reach the UK Top Ten since \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\" in 1987 and the band's first Top 40 entry since \"Beautiful\" in 1995. The second single from the album, \"Don't Hurt Yourself\", reached No.&nbsp;16. Following this, they released a download-only single, \"The Damage (live)\", recorded at the band's sell-out gig at the [[London Astoria]]. All of this succeeded in putting the band back in the public consciousness, making the campaign a success. In September 2004 Marillion returned for shows in Mexico, USA and ended in Canada Quebec City on 13 October 2004.\n\nMarillion continued to tour throughout 2005 playing several summer festivals and embarking on acoustic tours of both Europe and the United States, followed up by the \"Not Quite Christmas Tour\" of Europe throughout the end of 2005.\n\nA new DVD, ''Colours and Sound'', was released in Feb 2006, documenting the creation, promotion, release, and subsequent European tour in support of the album ''Marbles''.\n\n====''Somewhere Else'' and ''Happiness is the Road'' (2007\u20132008)====\nIn February 2007 the Marillion weekend was held abroad for the first time in the Netherlands at [[Center Parcs Europe|Center Parcs]], Port Z\u00e9lande.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-16|title=marillion.com/tour/setlist|url=https://www.marillion.com/tour/setlist.htm?tourid=33&archive=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-16|title=/interview-with-mark-kelly-marillion/|url=https://www.metalexpressradio.com/2007/08/24/interview-with-mark-kelly-marillion/}}</ref>\n\nApril 2007 saw Marillion release their fourteenth studio album ''[[Somewhere Else (Marillion album)|Somewhere Else]]'', their first album in 10 years to make the UK Top No.&nbsp;30.  The success of the album was further underscored by that of the download-only single \"See it Like a Baby\", making UK No.&nbsp;45 (March 2007) and the traditional CD release of \"[[Thankyou Whoever You Are]] / Most Toys\", which made UK No.&nbsp;15 and No.&nbsp;6 in the Netherlands during June 2007. The ''Somewhere Else'' tour started in Gibraltar 14 April 2007, and they also played in some places they had never been before like Bratislava.\n\nIn July 2008 the band posted a contest for fans to create a music video for the soon-to-be released single \"Whatever is Wrong with You\", and post it on YouTube.

It is another double album, with one disc based on a concept and the second containing the other songs that are not a part of the theme. Before the album's release, on 9 September 2008, Marillion pre-released their album via p2p networks themselves. Upon attempting to play the downloaded files, users were shown a video from the band explaining why they had taken this route. Downloaders were then able to opt to purchase the album at a user-defined price or select to receive DRM-free files for free, in exchange for an email address. The band explained that although they do not support piracy, they realised their music would inevitably be distributed online anyway, and wanted to attempt to engage with p2p users and make the best of the situation.<ref>Marillion Press Release (11 September 2008) [http://www.antimusic.com/news/08/sep/11Marillion_Use_P2P_for_Album_Release.shtml \"Marillion Use P2P for Album Release]\" ''Anti Music''</ref>\n\n====''Less is More'' and ''Sounds That Can't Be Made'' (2009\u20132014) ====\nIn April 2009 they took their Marillion weekend to Montreal for the first time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-01|title=montrealgazette|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/marillion-the-complete-qa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-01|title=marillion.com|url=https://www.marillion.com/tour/setlist.htm?tourid=45&archive=1}}</ref>\n\nThe band's sixteenth studio album (released 2 October 2009) was an acoustic album featuring new arrangements of previously released tracks (except one, the new track: \"It's Not Your Fault\") entitled ''[[Less Is More (Marillion album)|Less Is More]]''.

Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of [[Peter Gabriel]]-era [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and [[Mellotron]]-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by [[Mark Wilkinson]] used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.\n\nAs Jon Wilde summarised in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1989: <blockquote>At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with \"[[Market Square Heroes]]\". There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going.  As [[punk rock|punk]] was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp.  When compared to [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|ELP]], they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked \u2013 \"[[Garden Party (Marillion song)|Garden Party]]\", \"[[Punch and Judy (song)|Punch and Judy]]\" and \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\". By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.<ref>Jonh Wilde. \"Fish - A Chip Off the Shoulder\". p 42-43. ''Melody Maker''. 28 October 1989</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe band's unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' in 1987, [[David Hepworth]] wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that.

What are [[Radiohead]] if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\"<ref name=\"Jon Hotten 2004\"/> In the ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' & ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' Classic Special Edition ''[[Pink Floyd]] & The Story of Prog Rock'', an article on Marillion written by [[Mick Wall]] described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".<ref>Mick Wall ''Q Classic: Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock'', 2005.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Stephen Dalton of ''[[The Times]]'' stated: <blockquote>The band have just released their 14th album, ''[[Somewhere Else (Marillion album)|Somewhere Else]]'', which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like [[Coldplay]], ache like [[Radiohead]] and thunder like [[Muse (band)|Muse]], it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called ''[[Script for a Jester's Tear]]''.

He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\".

It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we'd changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It's such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a 'dinosaur prog band'. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven't listened to anything we've done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we've done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It's a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] they say: 'Sorry, we don't play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here's the new [[U2]] single.' I suppose it's something everyone has to cope with \u2013 every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years.
