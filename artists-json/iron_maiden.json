While fluid in the early years of the band, the lineup for most of the band's history has consisted of Harris, lead vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]], drummer [[Nicko McBrain]], and guitarists [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], [[Adrian Smith]], and [[Janick Gers]]. The band have released 41 albums, including 17 studio albums, 13 live albums, four [[Extended play|EPs]], and seven [[compilation album|compilations]]. They have also released 47 singles and 20 video albums. Two electronic games have been released with Iron Maiden soundtracks, and the band's music is featured in a number of other video games.\n\nAs pioneers of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1980's [[Iron Maiden (album)|debut album]], 1981's ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'', 1982's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', 1983's ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', 1984's ''[[Powerslave]]'', 1985's live release ''[[Live After Death]]'', 1986's ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', 1988's ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', 1990's ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'', and 1992's ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]''. In 1982 the band released its album ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', the first with [[Bruce Dickinson]], who replaced [[Paul Di'Anno]] as lead singer. This was a turning point in their career, helping establish Iron Maiden as one of heavy metal's most important artists.{{sfn|NOTB History|2021}} ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.{{sfn|Dig20|2022}}{{sfn|20mln|2022}}{{sfn|40A1|2022}}{{sfn|40A2|2022}}{{sfn|40A3|2022}}{{sfn|NotBHist|2022}}{{sfn|Number40|2022}}{{sfn|TN40An20|2022}}{{sfn|TNOTB40|2022}}{{Sfn|NotBData|2021}}{{sfn|NOTB40CS|2022}}\n\nSince the return of lead vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] in 1999, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours.{{sfn|Green|2010}} Released in 2006, fourteenth studio album ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (album)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'', reached top sales in dozen of countries, initiating the series of Iron Maiden's highest-ranked albums.

For over 40&nbsp;years, the musicians have been supported by their famous mascot, \"[[Eddie (Iron Maiden)|Eddie]]\", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, videos and merchandise. Originally designed by [[Derek Riggs]], Eddie became the main attraction of Iron Maiden live shows, which feature theatrical elements like coloured backdrops, inflatables, pyrotechnics, elaborate lighting rigs, props and stage sets.{{sfn|Eddie Riggs|2021}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1975\u20131978)===\n[[File:Cartandhorses.jpg|thumb|right|The Cart and Horses Pub, located in Maryland Point, Stratford, was where Iron Maiden played some of their first shows in 1976. The building was officially named \"The Birthplace of Iron Maiden\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004a|1p=29|2a1=Bushell|2a2=Halfin|2y=1985a|2p=9}}]]\n\nIron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975 by bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas]], the title of which reminded him of the [[iron maiden|iron maiden torture device]].{{sfn|Barton|1979}} They originally had the name Ash Mountain, but most of the band members preferred the name Iron Maiden anyway so that name was chosen shortly after the band formed. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in [[Maryland, London|Maryland]], Stratford.{{sfn|Wall|2004b|p=29}} A few decades later the pub in Maryland was officially named \"The Birthplace of Iron Maiden\" and turned into a music pub with many mementos of the band's early years as part of London's rock music history.{{sfn|Cart and Horses|2021}}\n\nThe original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist [[Paul Day (musician)|Paul Day]] being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked \"energy or charisma on stage\".{{sfn|Wall|2004c|p=32}} He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances.{{sfn|Wall|2004c|p=32}} Wilcock's friend, guitarist [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.{{sfn|Wall|2004d|p=33}} Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976,{{sfn|Wall|2004d|p=33}} though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases.\n\n[[File:Harris 1.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]\nIron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.{{sfn|Wall|2004e|p=44}} Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,{{sfn|Wall|2004f|p=46}} as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.{{sfn|EMI|2004}} A new line-up was put together, including future [[Cutting Crew]] member [[Tony Moore (musician)|Tony Moore]] on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]] (better known today as Thunderstick). After a single gig with the band in January 1978, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound.{{sfn|Wall|2004i|p=48}} Dave Murray rejoined in late March 1978 which Terry Wapram disapproved of so he was sacked. A few weeks later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, with Terry Wapram, and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]] left as well. Doug Sampson was at Dennis and Thunderstick's last gig and so joined the band afterwards.\n\nHarris, Murray, and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.{{sfn|Wall|2004k|p=52}} A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in [[Leytonstone]] in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist [[Paul Di'Anno]].{{sfn|Wall|2004l|p=54}} Steve Harris stated, \"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004m|p=53}} At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004n|p=64}}\n\n===Record contract and early releases (1978\u20131981)===\n{{main|The Soundhouse Tapes|Iron Maiden (album)|Killers (Iron Maiden album)}}\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.{{sfn|Wall|2004o|p=66}} Hoping that the recording would help them secure more gigs,{{sfn|Wall|2004o|p=66}} the band presented a copy to [[Neal Kay]], then managing a heavy metal club called \"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.{{sfn|Wall|2004p|p=67}} Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \"Prowler\", eventually went to No.&nbsp;1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wall|2004r|pp=104\u2013105}} A copy was also acquired by [[Rod Smallwood]], who soon became the band's manager,{{sfn|Wall|2004s|p=83}} and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as ''[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]'', named after the club.{{sfn|Wall|2004t|p=103}} Featuring only three tracks (one song, \"Strange World\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production){{sfn|Wall|2004u|p=102}} all five thousand copies sold out within weeks.{{sfn|Wall|2004v|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n[[File:IRON MAIDEN - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Di'Anno]] and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] supporting [[Judas Priest]] on their British Steel Tour, 1980]]\nIn December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with [[EMI]],{{sfn|Wall|2004w|p=108}} and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, [[Adrian Smith]] of [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], to join the group as their second guitarist.{{sfn|Wall|2004z|pp=163\u2013164}} Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and [[Dennis Stratton]] was hired instead.{{sfn|Wall|2004aa|p=121}} Shortly afterwards, [[Doug Sampson]] left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-[[Samson (band)|Samson]] drummer [[Clive Burr]] at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.{{sfn|Wall|2004bb|p=123}} Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the ''[[Metal for Muthas]]'' compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" and \"Wrathchild\".{{sfn|Wall|2004cc|p=137}} The release led to an [[Metal for Muthas Tour|ensuing tour]] which featured several other bands linked with the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] ([[NWoBHM]]) movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004dd|1p=139|2a1=Saulnier|2y=2012dd}} According to different sources between May 1976 and December 1979 the band played about 200 shows in Great Britain.{{sfn|SetlistED|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}\n\nIron Maiden released their [[Iron Maiden (album)|self-titled album]] in 1980, which debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Wall|2004ee|p=143}} The album includes other early favourites such as \"[[Running Free]]\", \"Transylvania\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", and \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" \u2013 which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a [[Iron Maiden Tour|headline tour of the UK]], before opening for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their 1980 [[Unmasked Tour]]'s European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on [[British Steel Tour|select dates]]. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980 with almost 40,000 in attendance. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with [[UFO (band)|UFO]] headlining. After the Kiss tour, [[Dennis Stratton]] was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,{{sfn|Hinchcliffe|1999}} and was replaced by Smith in October 1980. In Europe Iron Maiden played 28 shows to about 400,000 people (mainly [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fans). In December the musicians played at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London where the band's very first live video was filmed. ''[[Live at the Rainbow]]'' was released in May 1981 and the cuts \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Wrathchild\" from this video received heavy rotation on [[MTV]] during its first hours on the air as the first metal videos ever.{{sfn|First Albums|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|Roland|2013}}\n\nAn eponymous debut album achieved critical acclaim in Japan where Iron Maiden were named \"The Best Newcoming Foreign Band\" by readers of Music Life magazine and received their very first Gold certificate.{{sfn|Japan 1980|2021}} Four decades later Iron Maiden's debut album was ranked No.&nbsp;13 of \"The Greatest Hard Rock & Metal Albums Ever\" published by journalists of opinion-forming [[Rolling Stone]] magazine and also named the third most important metal debut album of all time. ''Iron Maiden'' is ranked at the similar positions in many other polls worldwide.{{sfn|40Anni|2021}}{{sfn|40Anos|2021}}\n\nIn 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]''. Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, it had only two new songs written for the record: \"Prodigal Son\" and \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\"{{sfn|Wall|2004ff|p=183}} (the latter's title was taken from the [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).{{sfn|Brannigan}} The leitmotif of the lyrics was a murder contemplated from different perspectives.{{sfn|First Albums|2021}} Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,{{sfn|Wall|2004gg|p=145}} the band hired veteran producer [[Martin Birch]],{{sfn|Wall|2004hh|p=181}} who would continue to work with Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.{{sfn|Wall|2004ii|p=300}} The record was followed by the band's first [[Killer World Tour|world tour]], which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at [[Aladdin (hotel and casino)|The Aladdin Casino]] in Las Vegas.

The cover illustration by [[Derek Riggs]] became the first of many more iconic covers in the history of the genre.{{sfn|First Albums|2021}} ''Killers'' sold much better worldwide than the debut album, hitting the million mark a year after launch, earning the group Gold certificates in Germany, Japan, Canada, [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], France (double Gold) and in the United Kingdom.

However, Paul Di'Anno's addiction problems led to the cancellation of several German dates. In some of those cities, local fans reacted with street riots. Iron Maiden then toured Japan for the first time in seven shows. All tickets were sold out in record time, but further problems with Di'Anno forced the band to cancel two shows.

Iron Maiden used, inter alia, a 100,000 watts sound system, a first for any group, designed specially for large sports arenas.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} The lighting equipment, in addition to the standard ramps with spots, included four movable, triangular ramps, rising to different heights above the stage and illuminating the audience from different angles. These were the first ramps of this type in the world, and their construction became a significant step forward as a starting point for the creation of mobile, extensive lighting systems used on subsequent tours. The lighting platform was based on over 520 lamps.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} As with the previous tour, the band had a conceptual set design with a number of props referring to the image of the promoted album, the movable Eddie and his big head emerging from behind the stage, also more use was made of pyrotechnics.{{sfn|Golden Era|2021}}\n\nUK magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' summed up the passing year, and readers were asked to select one hundred best metal albums of all time, resulting with ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' ranked first, followed by ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', and the band's other releases were all in the Top 50.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} The rankings in other regions of the world looked similar.

The [[World Slavery Tour]] documentary brought footage of the band touring the Eastern Europe in 1984, performing shows in the countries visited, and additionally portrayed the musicians as playing at a Polish wedding in [[Pozna\u0144]]. The video contained two promotional clips for songs from the ''[[Powerslave]]'' album, brand new live tracks and special interviews with musicians and members of the road crew. ''Behind the Iron Curtain'' was the first documentary published by a Western artist which pictured them touring the countries of [[Eastern Bloc]]. MTV broadcast an expanded version (about one hour long) of this documentary, which became a part of the ''[[Live After Death|Live After Death DVD]]'' released in February 2008.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|BTRC|2021}}\n\nIron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined (with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) the [[Rock in Rio]] festival to an estimated 350,000 \u2013 500,000 in attendance.{{sfn|RiRAt|2022}}{{sfn|EMI|2008}} The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).{{sfn|Wall|2004eee|p=258}} This was the first substantial break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,{{sfn|Stenning 2|2006|p=104}} with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.{{sfn|Wall|2004fff|p=255}} In October 1985 Iron Maiden published their first double live album, ''[[Live After Death]]'', which was a critical and commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;19 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''{{sfn|Billboard}} and No.&nbsp;2 in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004ggg|p=257}} The album was recorded at [[Long Beach Arena]] and also features additional tracks from four nights at London's [[Hammersmith Apollo]].

The band presented a powerful and elaborated lighting rig (over 1000 lamps and lasers) and scenery partly reminiscent of the 1980s. The setting of the Monsters of Rock concerts was completed by the huge Eddie crowning the stage and screens. Iron Maiden made their first appearance in [[Iceland]] and returned to Oceania after a seven-year hiatus. The tour in Japan was the largest in the history of the group. The tour witnessed the personal conflicts between Bruce Dickinson and rest of the band.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|DarkEra|2021}}\n\nIn 1993, Bruce Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a [[Real Live Tour|farewell tour]] and two live albums (later re-released in [[A Real Live Dead One|one package]]).{{sfn|Wall|2004ag|p=293}} The first, ''[[A Real Live One]]'', featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993. The second, ''[[A Real Dead One]]'', featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.{{sfn|Wall|2004ah|p=296}} Dickinson denied that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to \"make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right\", and that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004ai|p=297}} On 1 May 1993 the band performed at the \"Primo Maggio Free Festival\" in Rome, Piazza San Giovanni.

The band played in stadiums and large arenas in South America and resurged with mainstream popularity in Greece. The stage production was smaller than previous years but included many elements Iron Maiden were famous for: two Eddies, mobile lighting rig, conceptual stage set or backdrops. The tenth studio album sold in 1.3 million copies, the lowest sales result since 1981.{{sfn|Wall|2004ap|p=315}} After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, ''[[Best of the Beast]]''. The band's first compilation, it included a new single, \"[[Virus (Iron Maiden song)|Virus]]\", in which the lyrics attack the critics, who had recently written off the band. Initially the musicians planned to release a video compilation but quit, due to the unsatisfying quality of available video remastering.{{sfn|Wall|2004ar|p=316}}\n\nIn 1998 Iron Maiden released ''[[Virtual XI]]'', whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date, failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in the band's history.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(a)}}{{sfn|Sverigetopplistan}} The album peaked at No.&nbsp;16 in the UK; the band's lowest for a new studio record.{{sfn|Official Charts Company|1998}} At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including ''Live at Donington'' (which was given a mainstream release for the first time).

They also announced the participation of Dave Lights, who did their lighting and effects in the 1980s. Management booked more mid\u2013size arenas and stadiums in Latin America, including a headline show at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in Buenos Aires, Argentina as the final show of the tour.{{sfn|VXI|2021}} Finally, the band used bigger backdrops, more elaborate lighting rigs, a conceptual stage set and an inflatable Eddie's head and hands which embraced both sides of the stage. Fans didn't see pyrotechnics and the kind of production comparable with \u201880s monumental stage sets as it was previously announced. The tour was a big disappointment, both to musicians and the fans.{{sfn|1998Prod|2021}}\n\nBayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.{{sfn|Wall|2004as|p=324}} The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the [[Virtual XI World Tour]],{{sfn|Wall|2004at|p=321}} although Janick Gers stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2010}}\n\n===Return of Dickinson and Smith, ''Brave New World'' (1999\u20132002)===\n{{main|Ed Hunter|Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)}}\n[[File:Iron Maiden en Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Adrian Smith (left) re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, resulting in a three\u2013guitar line-up.]]\n\nWhile the group were considering a replacement for Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004au|p=328}} Although Harris admitted that he \"wasn't really into it\" at first, he then thought, \"'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?'

The band visited North America and several European countries to present the conceptual show inspired by scenes from the game. Iron Maiden used a two-part stage related to graphics from the promoted game, three movable screens surrounded by light ramps, projectors, huge backdrops, pyrotechnics (for the first time since 1988), colourful props, visuals and two types of Eddie in the version known from the game. The equipment travelled in seven huge trucks.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}\n\nOne of Dickinson's primary concerns on rejoining the group \"was whether we would in fact be making a real state-of-the-art record and not just a comeback album,\"{{sfn|Wall|2004a3|p=328}} which eventually took the form of 2000's ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004a4|p=341}} Having disliked the results from Harris' personal studio, Barnyard Studios located on his property in Essex,{{sfn|Berelian|2000}} which had been used for the last four Iron Maiden studio albums, the band recorded the new release at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, France in November 1999 with producer [[Kevin Shirley]].{{sfn|Wall|2004a5|p=341}} New release was promoted by two singles \"[[The Wicker Man (song)|The Wicker Man]]\" and \"[[Out of the Silent Planet (song)|Out of the Silent Planet]]\", both of them achieving success on the UK singles chart.{{sfn|Wall|2004a6|pp=341\u2013343}} Thematic influences continued with \"The Wicker Man\" \u2013 based on the 1973 British [[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|cult film of the same name]] \u2013 and \"Brave New World\" \u2013 a title taken from the [[Aldous Huxley]] [[Brave New World|novel of the same name]].{{sfn|Wall|2004a7|p=342}} The album furthered the more progressive and melodic sound present in some earlier recordings, with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration.{{sfn|Wall|2004a8|p=342}} The album was a commercial and an artistic success and is considered a modern classic alongside the band's releases from the '80s. ''Brave New World'' charted at No. 7 in the [[UK Album Charts]] and No.&nbsp;39 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' and Top 5 in many other territories, and eventually went Gold and Platinum in a dozen other countries worldwide.

It is equally important for those who play power metal, speed, thrash, death, black, hard rock \u2013 almost every genre. Iron Maiden took hard rock from the '70s, took it into the' 80s, and created a new genre that didn't exist before. This band introduced a [[DIY]] approach to all rock music. They even more than all the others popularised guitar harmonies in metal. Many metal bands in existence today have two guitarists, who use double guitar harmonies, and that's where they are inspired by Iron Maiden.{{sfn|G\u00f6tz K\u00fchnemund|2019}}\n\nJ\u00f6rg Pistorius, German music journalist, stated there is: \"No single band can claim to have created or invented heavy metal. However, there is one that shaped it and was largely responsible for making it a globally recognized style and market segment with high sales potential. (\u2026) Iron Maiden played fast guitar figures sparkling with energy, combined with harmonious melodies and choruses that could be sung immediately. No band has shaped heavy metal as much as Iron Maiden.\"{{sfn|VTNOTB|2022}}\n\n[[Ian Christe]], the Swiss musician, music journalist and an author of publication entitled ''[[Sound of the Beast]]'' claimed that Iron Maiden are responsible for the further development of the genre, carried out under the aegis of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. As he claimed, Iron Maiden, together with Judas Priest, is responsible for the greatest development of the metal genre. While AC/DC and Black Sabbath remained primal, dark, it was Iron Maiden and Judas Priest who transformed the twin guitar harmonies, creating a whole new quality.{{sfn|SotB|2022}}\n\nAccording to music journalist and the writer [[Neil Daniels]] Iron Maiden \"redefined the whole genre blending classic heavy rock influence with punky vibe, twin guitars attack and progressive approach which finally have created the new quality. Band's influence on generations of rock and metal bands cannot be overstated. They elevated metal to an art form, proving that academic and musical inspirations can coexist.\"{{sfn|Neil Daniels|2019b}} From the artist's profile published by the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] it appears that \"in the 1980s, Iron Maiden released seven high-octane albums that cemented them as one of the greatest rock bands \u2013 creating a blueprint for how heavy metal bands should look, sound and tour.\"{{sfn|RnRHoF Note|2021}}\n\nFormer guitarist and co-founder of Judas Priest band, [[K.K. Downing]], confessed Iron Maiden's \"music does not quite suit my taste, I cannot deny that it has had a great influence on heavy metal and music in general. As a Brit, I am terribly proud of what they have managed over the years to fill the niche they have created. Besides, I have always admired them for being able to achieve such a great commercial success for their marketing activities.\"{{sfn|K.K. Downing|2018|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n[[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] is considered one of the most influential musicians and composers in heavy rock history. He is also the author of the lion's share of the Iron Maiden's repertoire and the creator of the archetypal composition pattern in modern metal. In addition to writing riffs, vocal melodies and lyrics for most songs, he was also involved in audio-visual production and editing. The riffs created by him are among the most unforgettable in history, as evidenced by compositions such as \"[[The Trooper]]\", \"[[The Number of the Beast (song)|The Number of the Beast]]\", \"[[Phantom of the Opera (Iron Maiden song)|Phantom of the Opera]]\", \"[[Run to the Hills]]\", \"[[Fear of the Dark (song)|Fear of the Dark]]\" or \"[[Hallowed Be Thy Name (song)|Hallowed Be Thy Name]]\". The creator of Iron Maiden has been repeatedly named the best and most influential metal bassist of all time. He is also the originator of extremely expressive, galloping bass lines. His compositional style is based on triplets consisting of sixteenths and eighth notes, creating intense rhythmic background for a double (then triple) guitar attack. Steve Harris is one of the few bass players who can play extremely fast and dense \u2013 only with his fingers! This ability has become a sensation in the context of the entire heavy metal scene. According to the [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] editors \"technically it was incredibly impressive to achieve so much speed and dynamics in the sound without using a standard pick\". The founder of Iron Maiden inspired masses of future musicians, including such thrash metal bassists as [[Frank Bello|Frankie Bello]] of Anthrax, and former and current Metallica bassists [[Cliff Burton]], [[Jason Newsted]], and [[Robert Trujillo]].{{sfn|Harris|2021}}\n\n===Appearance in media===\nThe first heavy metal videos in history broadcast by [[MTV]] were the images for the live versions of \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Wrathchild\" taken from official VHS ''[[Live at the Rainbow|Live at the Rainbow (Iron Maiden)]]''.{{sfn|MTV|2021}}{{sfn|List25|2021}} The song \"Flash of the Blade\" was included on the soundtrack of [[Dario Argento]]'s 1985 horror film ''[[Phenomena (film)|Phenomena]]'' (AKA \"Creepers\") and was covered by the American band [[Avenged Sevenfold]] on their double live album/DVD ''[[Live in the LBC & Diamonds in the Rough]]''. [[Rhapsody of Fire]] have also recorded a cover of the song that is featured on the deluxe edition of their album ''[[From Chaos to Eternity]]''. \"Flash of the Blade\" can also be heard in the ''[[Jem and the Holograms]]'' episode \"Kimber's Rebellion\", just after the cartoon band members return home from Paris, on a boom-box stereo being carried by a passerby.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}\n\nThe band's name has been mentioned prominently in several songs, such as the singles \"[[Teenage Dirtbag]]\" by [[Wheatus]],{{sfn|Basham|2000}} \"[[Back to the 80's (song)|Back to the 80's]]\" by Danish dance-pop band [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]].{{sfn|MetroLyrics(1)}} and \"[[Fat Lip]]\" by [[Sum 41]].{{sfn|Sputnikmusic(1)}} Iron Maiden have also been referenced in [[Weezer]]'s \"Heart Songs\" (from their 2008 self-titled \"[[Weezer (2008 album)|Red]]\" album),{{sfn|MetroLyrics(2)}} [[Blues Traveller]]'s \"Psycho Joe\" (from 1997's ''[[Straight On till Morning (album)|Straight on till Morning]]''),{{sfn|MetroLyrics(3)}} and [[NOFX]]'s \"Eddie, Bruce and Paul\" (from their 2009 album ''[[Coaster (album)|Coaster]]''), which [[Sputnikmusic]] describes as \"a humorous retelling of Paul DiAnno's departure\".{{sfn|Thomas|2009}}\n\nThe number of releases and ventures in tribute to the British formation can be estimated in hundreds, moreover - the reinterpretations of the band's achievements make up an extremely wide range of stylistic variants, such as: numerous sub-genres of rock and metal, soul, pop, classics, symphonic music, alternative music, electro, techno, industrial, hip-hop, rap, reggae, ska, jazz, chorales, pastiches, piano music, early music, string music, early music or acoustic versions with a wide range of classical instruments.{{sfn|Tribute1|2021}}{{sfn|Tribute2|2021}} In 2008, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' released ''[[Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden]]'', an album composed of Iron Maiden cover songs performed by Metallica, [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Dream Theater]], Trivium, [[Coheed and Cambria]], Avenged Sevenfold, and other groups influenced by the band.{{sfn|Kerrang!|2008}} In 2010, [[Maiden uniteD]], an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of [[Ayreon]], [[Threshold (band)|Threshold]] and [[Within Temptation]], released ''[[Mind the Acoustic Pieces]]'', a re-interpretation of the entire ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' album.{{sfn|Maiden United}} As of 2021 nearly 200 Iron Maiden cover audio-visual releases exist (each featuring various artists), including piano,{{sfn|AllMusic}} electro,{{sfn|Aquarius Records}} string quartet{{sfn|Loftus}} and hip-hop tributes among many others.{{sfn|AllMusic(2)}}\n\nIron Maiden songs have been featured in the soundtracks of several video games, including ''[[Carmageddon 2]]'',{{sfn|Giant Bomb}} ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'',{{sfn|IGN}} ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City]]'',{{sfn|Allgame}} ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned]]'',{{sfn|Rockstar Games}} Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'',{{sfn|Polygon2021|2021}} ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4]]'',{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2002}} ''[[SSX on Tour]]''{{sfn|Cheat Code Central}} and ''[[Madden NFL 10]]''.{{sfn|Metal Insider|2009}} Their music also appears in the ''[[Guitar Hero]] ''and ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' series of [[music video game|rhythmic video games]].{{sfnm|1a1=East|1y=2009|2a1=Rock Band}} The U.S shooter game entitled ''[[PowerSlave]]'' was a reference to the Iron Maiden's album of the same name, released In 1984, which also features an Egyptian-themed cover.{{sfn|PSMG|2022}}{{sfn|PSRU|2022}}\n\n[[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] author Bill Forster is an avowed Iron Maiden fan and made several Iron Maiden references, including song lyrics and the phrase \"Up the Irons\" in his books, including ''[[The Transformers: The Ark : A Complete Compendium of Transformers Animation Models|The Ark]]'' series and ''The AllSpark Almanac'' series.{{sfnm|1a1=Angelfire(1)|2a1=Angelfire(2)}} Iron Maiden music, lyrics, themes, fans and iconography have appeared in many episodes and movies including quasi-documentary comedies as ''Schemers'',{{sfn|Schemers|2020}} ''The Night of the Beast''{{sfn|The Night of the Beast|2020}} also in documentary movies such as ''[[Global Metal]]''{{sfn|Global Metal|2008}} or band's own ''[[Flight 666]]'' among many others.{{sfn|Flight 666 the movie|2009}} Iron Maiden songs have also appeared in films, such as ''[[Phenomena (film)|Phenomena]]'' (entitled ''Creepers'' in the US),{{sfn|BillWyman.com|2014}} and ''[[Murder by Numbers]]'';{{sfn|JoBlo.com}} while MTV's animated duo [[Beavis and Butt-Head]] have commented favourably on the band several times.{{sfnm|1a1=Wardlaw|2a1=Ling|2y=2005}} \"[[The Trooper]]\" song and elements of the band's image appeared in a youth musical comedy entitled ''[[Metal Lords]]'' broadcast on [[Netflix]].{{sfn|MLNX|2022}}\n\n[[Bruce Dickinson]] is the most active in media member of the band. Iron Maiden frontman presented ''Bruce Dickinson's Friday Rock Show'' on [[BBC]] radio station [[6 Music]] from 2002 to 2010.{{sfn|FRS|2010}} In addition to his show on 6 Music, Dickinson also hosted a series entitled ''Masters of Rock'' on [[BBC Radio 2]] from 2003 to 2007.{{sfn|MOR BBC|2007}} His singing and episode acting were presented in ''The Club Paradise'',{{sfn|Club Paradise|1990}} ''[[Mr. Bean|Mr. Bean's Elected]]'',{{sfn|Mr. Bean|1991}} and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child]]''{{sfn|Nightmare|1989}} Dickinson's aviation passion and storytelling talent were reflected in ''[[Flying Heavy Metal|Flying Heavy Metal (Discovery Series)]]'' among many other documents.{{sfn|Flying Heavy Metal|2005}} Bruce Dickinson was the main character of the ''Psycho Schizo Espresso'' podcast, which was published on social platforms. The topics of individual episodes were phenomena that could not be explained in a rational way. The interviews with controversial people were also broadcast.{{sfn| PSE |2022}}\n\n===Claims of Satanic references===\nIn 1982, the band released one of their most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as [[Satanism|Satanists]], encouraging people to destroy copies of the release.{{sfn|Young(1)}} The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes.{{sfnm|1a1=Eagle Vision|1y=2001|2a1=Young(1)}} The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2011(2)}}\n\nContrary to the accusations, the band have always denied the notion that they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the ''[[Live After Death]]'' concert video.{{sfn|EMI|2008}} Steve Harris has since commented that, \"It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004b6|p=228}} Harris has also stated that \"[[The Number of the Beast (song)|The Number of the Beast]]\" song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004b7|p=224}} and also influenced by [[Robert Burns]]' \"[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]\".{{sfn|Eagle Vision|2001}} Furthermore, the band's drummer, [[Nicko McBrain]], has been a born-again Christian since 1999.{{sfn|Godscare}}\n\n===Ed Force One===\n[[File:Boeing 757-23A, Astraeus AN1497690.jpg|thumb|The band's former Ed Force One, a [[Boeing 757-200]]]]\n\nFor their [[Somewhere Back in Time World Tour]] in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an [[Astraeus Airlines]] [[Boeing 757]]<!-- The first two Ed Force Ones were Boeing 757s.

(Iron Maiden album)|Behind the Beast]]\".\n\nFor [[The Book of Souls World Tour]] in 2016, the band upgraded to an ex-[[Air France]] [[Boeing 747-400]] jumbo jet, supplied by [[Air Atlanta Icelandic]] (registered TF-AAK){{sfnm|1a1=PlaneSpotters.net|2a1=Sands|2y=2016}} and customised by [[Volga-Dnepr Airlines|Volga-Dnepr Gulf]],{{sfn|volga-dnepr.com|2016}} which allows for more space without the aircraft having to undergo a significant conversion to carry their equipment.{{sfn|Lach|2015b}} In January 2022, Bruce Dickinson told the [[Associated Press]] that he would not be piloting band's plane on their upcoming tour citing his nearing the mandatory age limit for commercial airline pilots. According to the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO), commercial pilots must retire at age 65. However, there is currently no maximum age limit for being a private pilot or for being an Air Force pilot.{{sfn|EF1B|2022}}\n\n==Musical style and influences==\n{{Listen\n|filename= IronMaidenRTTH.ogg\n|title= \"Run to the Hills\" (1982)\n|description= \"Run to the Hills\" (''The Number of the Beast'') demonstrates the band's trademark \"gallop\" riff style.\n|filename2= IronMaidenCSIT.ogg\n|title2= \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" (1986)\n|description2= \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" (''Somewhere in Time'').

Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\"{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} In 2004, Harris explained that the band's \"heaviness\" was inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\"{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2004c}} On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \"more like a rhythm guitar,\"{{sfn|Popoff|2005(c)}} cited as responsible for the band's galloping style,{{sfn|Fender}} heard in such songs as \"[[The Trooper]]\"{{sfn|Huey(2)}} and \"Run to the Hills.\"{{sfn|Lawson}}\n\nThe band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing style. Dave Murray is known for his [[legato]] technique which, he claims, \"evolved naturally. I'd heard [[Jimi Hendrix]] using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.\"{{sfn|McIver|2010(a)}} Stating that he \"was inspired by [[blues rock]] rather than metal,\" Adrian Smith was influenced by [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Pat Travers]], leading to him becoming a \"melodic player.\"{{sfn|McIver|2010(c)}} Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by [[Ritchie Blackmore]],{{sfn|Wall|2004b8|p=277}} which he claims is in contrast to Smith's \"rhythmic\" sound.{{sfn|McIver|2010(b)}}\n\nSinger Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith,{{sfn|Wall|2004b14|p=244}} has an operatic vocal style, inspired by [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Peter Hammill]], [[Ian Anderson]] and [[Ian Gillan]],{{sfn|Dmme.net}} and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.{{sfnm|1a1=Rosen|1y=2011|2a1=HearYa.com|2y=2006|3a1=Blabbermouth.net|3y=2009a|4a1=Blabbermouth.net|4y=2009b}} Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the ''Dance of Death'' album,{{sfn|Ling|2005b}} Harris often relies on him while developing songs. Adrian Smith commented, \"Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004b9|p=241}}\n\nThroughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, in spite of the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's ''Somewhere in Time'',{{sfn|Prato}} keyboards on 1988's ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'',{{sfn|Wall|2004b10|p=265}} and an attempt to return to the \"stripped down\" production of their earlier material on {{notatypo|1990's}} ''No Prayer for the Dying''.{{sfn|Wall|2004b11|p=283}} In recent years, however, the band have begun using more [[progressive rock|progressive]] elements in their songs,{{sfnm|1a1=Dome|1y=2006a|2a1=Dome|2y=2006b}} which Steve Harris describes as not progressive \"in the modern sense, but like [[Dream Theater]], more in a 70s way\".{{sfn|Dome|2006b}} According to Harris, ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'' was the band's first album which was \"more progressive\",{{sfn|Wall|2004b12|p=264}} while they would only return to this style from 1995's ''The X Factor'', which he states is \"like an extension of ''Seventh Son''..., in the sense of the progressive element to it\".{{sfn|Wall|2004b13|p=311}} The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material,{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} which [[AllMusic]] states was \"clearly drawing from elements of punk rock\",{{sfn|Huey(1)}} although Harris firmly denies this.{{sfn|VH1|2011}}\n\n==Band members==\n{{further|List of Iron Maiden band members}}\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(1975\u2013present)</small>, keyboards <small>(1988, 1998\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]] \u2013 guitars <small>(1976\u20131977, 1978\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Adrian Smith]] \u2013 guitars, backing vocals <small>(1980\u20131990, 1999\u2013present)</small>, keyboards <small>(1988)</small>\n* [[Bruce Dickinson]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(1981\u20131993, 1999\u2013present)</small>, piano <small>(2015)</small>\n* [[Nicko McBrain]] \u2013 drums <small>(1982\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Janick Gers]] \u2013 guitars <small>(1990\u2013present)</small>\n\n'''Touring musicians'''\n* Michael Kenney \u2013 keyboards <small>(1988\u20132021)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Iron Maiden discography|List of songs recorded by Iron Maiden}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=33%}}\n* ''[[Iron Maiden (album)|Iron Maiden]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[Powerslave]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'' (1992)\n{{col-break|width=33%}}\n* ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Virtual XI]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Dance of Death (album)|Dance of Death]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (album)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Final Frontier]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Book of Souls]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Senjutsu (album)|Senjutsu]]'' (2021)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Concert tours==\n{{main|List of Iron Maiden concert tours}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:220px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Concert tour\n! style=\"width:150px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Duration\n! colspan=6|Lineups\n! style=\"width:40px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Dates\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Vocals\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Bass\n! style=\"width:300px;\" colspan=3|Guitars\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Drums\n|-\n| Early Days Shows\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| May 1976 \u2013 Dec 1979\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| [[Paul Di'Anno|P.
