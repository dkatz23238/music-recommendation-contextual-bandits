In 1980, he wrote and produced the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\" for [[Kenny Rogers]]. The following year, he wrote and produced the single \"[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]\", which he recorded as a duet with [[Diana Ross]]; it remains among the top 20 bestselling singles of all time, and the biggest career hit for both artists.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100-60th-anniversary|title=Hot 100 turns 60|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=August 6, 2018}}</ref> In 1982, he officially launched his solo career with the album ''[[Lionel Richie (album)|Lionel Richie]]'', which sold over four million copies and spawned the singles \"[[You Are (Lionel Richie song)|You Are]]\", \"[[My Love (Lionel Richie song)|My Love]]\", and the number one single \"[[Truly (Lionel Richie song)|Truly]]\".\n\nHis second album, ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'' (1983), reached number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and sold over 20 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]; and spawned the number one singles \"[[All Night Long (All Night)]]\" and \"[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]\".

In 1968, he became a singer and saxophonist with the [[Commodores]]. They signed a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1968 for one record before moving on to [[Motown Records]] initially as a support act to [[The Jackson 5]]. The Commodores then became established as a popular soul group. Their first several albums had a danceable, funky sound, as in such tracks as \"[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]\" and \"[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]\". Over time, Richie wrote and sang more romantic, easy-listening ballads such as \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\", \"[[Three Times a Lady]]\", \"[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]\", and the breakup ballad \"[[Sail On (song)|Sail On]]\".\n\nIn 1974, Richie achieved his first commercial success as a songwriter with \"[[Happy People (The Temptations song)|Happy People]]\", which he co-wrote with Jeffrey Bowen and Donald Baldwin. Originally intended as a Commodores track, it was recorded by [[The Temptations]], who had their penultimate No. 1 R&B with the song. By the late 1970s, Richie had begun to accept songwriting commissions from other artists. He composed \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\" for [[Kenny Rogers]], which hit No. 1 in 1980, and produced Rogers' album ''[[Share Your Love]]'' the following year. Richie and Rogers maintained a strong friendship in later years. Latin jazz composer and [[Salsa music|salsa]] romantica pioneer [[La Palabra (musician)|La Palabra]] enjoyed international success with his cover of \"Lady\", which was played at Latin dance clubs. Also in 1981, Richie sang the [[Endless Love (song)|title theme song]] for the film ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'', a duet with [[Diana Ross]]. Issued as a single, the song topped the Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and US pop music charts, and became one of Motown's biggest hits.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Its success encouraged Richie to branch out into a full-fledged solo career in 1982. He was replaced as lead singer for the Commodores by [[Skyler Jett]] in 1983.\n\n===Solo career===\n[[File:LionelRichie0995-1000.jpg|thumb|upright|Richie performing in 2006]]\nRichie's 1982 debut solo album, ''[[Lionel Richie (album)|Lionel Richie]]'', contained three hit singles: the U.S. number-one song \"[[Truly (Lionel Richie song)|Truly]]\", which continued the style of his ballads with the Commodores and launched his career as one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s, and the top five hits \"[[You Are (Lionel Richie song)|You Are]]\" and \"[[My Love (Lionel Richie song)|My Love]]\". The album hit No. 3 on the music charts and sold over 4 million copies. His 1983 follow-up album, ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', sold over twice as many copies and won two [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], propelling him into the first rank of international superstars. The album contained the number-one hit \"[[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]]\", a Caribbean-flavored dance number that was promoted by a colorful music video produced by former [[The Monkees|Monkee]] [[Michael Nesmith]]. In 1984, he performed \"All Night Long\" at the closing ceremony of the [[XXIII Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles.\n\nSeveral more Top 10 hits followed, the most successful of which was the ballad \"[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]\" (1984), a sentimental love song that showed how far he had moved from his R&B roots. Richie had three more top ten hits in 1984, \"[[Stuck on You (Lionel Richie song)|Stuck on You]]\" (No. 3), \"[[Running with the Night]]\" (No. 7) and \"[[Penny Lover]]\" (No. 8), as well as writing and producing \"Missing You\" for former labelmate and duet partner Diana Ross (No. 10 Pop, No. 1 R&B). In 1985, he wrote and performed \"[[Say You, Say Me]]\" for the film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]''. The song won an [[Academy Award]] and reached No. 1 on the U.S. charts, staying there for four weeks, making it the number-two song of 1986 according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Year-End Hot 100 chart, behind the charity single \"[[That's What Friends Are For]]\" by [[Dionne Warwick|Dionne]] and Friends. He also collaborated with [[Michael Jackson]] on the charity single \"[[We Are the World]]\" by [[USA for Africa]], another number-one hit.\n\nIn 1986, Richie released ''[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]'', his last widely popular album, which produced a run of five US and UK hits, \"[[Say You, Say Me]]\" (U.S. No. 1), \"[[Dancing on the Ceiling (Lionel Richie song)|Dancing on the Ceiling]]\" (U.S. No. 2), \"[[Love Will Conquer All]]\" (U.S. No. 9), \"[[Ballerina Girl]]\" (U.S. No. 7), and \"[[Se La]]\" (U.S. No. 20). He made his return to recording and performing following the release of his first greatest-hits collection, ''[[Back to Front (Lionel Richie album)|Back to Front]]'', in 1992.\n\nSince then, his ever-more-relaxed schedule has kept his recording and live work to a minimum. He broke the silence in 1996 with ''[[Louder Than Words (album)|Louder Than Words]]'', on which he resisted any change of style or the musical fashion-hopping of the past decade, sticking instead with his chosen path of well-crafted [[soul music]], which in the intervening years has become known as [[contemporary R&B]].\n\nRichie's albums in the late 1990s such as ''[[Louder Than Words (album)|Louder Than Words]]'' and ''[[Time (Lionel Richie album)|Time]]'' failed to match the commercial success of his earlier work. Some of his recent albums, such as ''[[Renaissance (Lionel Richie album)|Renaissance]]'' and ''[[Just for You (Lionel Richie album)|Just for You]]'', have returned to his older style and achieved success in Europe but only modest notice in the United States.\n\n===Later career===\n[[Image:Lionel Richie and Guy Sebastian.jpg|thumb|Richie and [[Guy Sebastian]] performing \"[[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]]\" during Richie's 2011 Australian and New Zealand tour]]\nRichie was the headliner at a 2006 Fourth of July tribute concert with [[Fantasia Barrino]] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. On May 7, 2006, Richie performed on the main stage (Acura Stage) at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], replacing [[Antoine \"Fats\" Domino]], who had fallen ill. Richie released his eighth studio album titled \"[[Coming Home (Lionel Richie album)|Coming Home]]\" on September 12, 2006. The first single of the album was \"[[I Call It Love]]\" and was premiered in July 2006, becoming his biggest hit in the U.S. in ten years. The album was a big success for Richie in the United States, peaking at No. 6.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}\n\nOn May 2, 2008, Richie was the 21st recipient of the ''[[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] [[Lifetime Achievement Award]]'' at [[UCLA]]'s annual [[UCLA Spring Sing|Spring Sing]].
