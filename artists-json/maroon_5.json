''[[Songs About Jane]]'' consists of songs about Levine's ex-girlfriend Jane Herman. On ''[[It Won't Be Soon Before Long]]'', however, the songs are less personal and are more electric with more use of synthesizers, creating a [[retro]] feel. ''[[Hands All Over (album)|Hands All Over]]'' continues the band's lost love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single \"Moves like Jagger\", an [[electropop]] song which represents a drastic change in the band's sound, with more of a dance feel to it. \"It was one of those songs that was definitely a risk\", Levine said. \"It's a bold statement. We've never really released a song like that. But it's exciting to do something different, do something new.
