September in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and [[March]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] are seasonally equivalent.\n\nIn the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the meteorological [[autumn]] is on 1 September. In the Southern hemisphere, the beginning of the meteorological [[Spring (season)|spring]] is on 1 September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climatechange/guide/effects/seasons.html|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090225040732/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climatechange/guide/effects/seasons.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-02-25|title=Met Office: Changing seasons|first=Met|last=Office|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}</ref>\u3000\n\nSeptember marks the beginning of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|ecclesiastical year]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. It is the start of the [[academic term|academic year]] in many countries of the northern hemisphere, in which children go back to school after the [[Summer vacation|summer break]], sometimes on [[September 1|the first day of the month]].\n\n[[September (Roman month)|September]] (from Latin ''septem'', \"seven\") was originally the seventh of ten months in the oldest known [[Roman calendar]], the [[Roman calendar#Legendary 10-month calendar|calendar of Romulus]] {{circa|750 BC}}, with March (Latin ''[[Martius (month)|Martius]]'') the first month of the year until perhaps as late as 451 BC.<ref>[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p.&nbsp;84; Gary Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion: One Thousand Years of Religious History'' (Routledge, 2012), p.&nbsp;14.</ref> After the calendar reform that added [[Ianuarius|January]] and [[Februarius|February]] to the beginning of the year, September became the ninth month but retained its name. It had 29 days until the Julian reform, which added a day.\n\n== September events ==\n[[Ancient Roman]] observances for September include [[Ludi Romani]], originally celebrated from September 12 to September 14, later extended to September 5 to September 19. In the 1st century BC, an extra day was added in honor of the deified Julius Caesar on 4 September. [[Epulum Jovis]] was held on September 13. [[Ludi Triumphales]] was held from September 18\u201322. The [[Septimontium]] was celebrated in September, and on December 11 on later calendars. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. \n\nSeptember was called \"harvest month\" in [[Charlemagne]]'s calendar. September corresponds partly to the [[Fructidor]] and partly to the [[Vend\u00e9miaire]] of the [[First French Republic|first French republic]]. September is called ''Herbstmonat'', harvest month, in Switzerland. The [[Anglo-Saxon]]s called the month ''Gerstmonath'', barley month, that crop being then usually harvested.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=September|volume=24|page=653}}</ref>\n\nIn 1752, the [[British Empire]] adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the British Empire that year, [[September 2]] was immediately followed by [[September 14]].\n\nOn [[Usenet]], it is said that September 1993 ([[Eternal September]]) never ended.\n\n== September in astronomy and astrology ==\nThe [[September equinox]] takes place in this month, and certain observances are organized around it. It is the [[Autumn equinox (northern hemisphere)|Autumn equinox]] in the Northern Hemisphere, and the [[Vernal equinox (southern hemisphere)|Vernal equinox]] in the Southern Hemisphere. The dates can vary from 21 September to 24 September (in [[UTC]]).\n\nSeptember is mostly in the sixth month of the astrological calendar (and the first part of the seventh), which begins at the end of March/Mars/Aries.\n\n== September symbols ==\n* September's [[birthstone]] is the [[sapphire]].\n[[File:Logansapphire.jpg|thumb|Sapphire]]\n*[[File:Morning glory.jpg|alt=Morning glories|thumb|[[Morning glory|Morning glories]]]][[File:Aster amellus - blooms (aka).jpg|alt=Asters|thumb|[[Aster (genus)|Asters]]]]The birth flowers for September are the [[forget-me-not]], [[morning glory]] and [[aster (genus)|aster]].<ref>{{cite web |author= SHG Resources |url= http://www.shgresources.com/gems/birthflowers |title= SHGresources.com |publisher=SHGresources.com |access-date= 2013-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flowerstower.com/singleflower.php?name=Forget-me-not |title=Flowerstower.com |access-date=2013-08-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224103640/http://www.flowerstower.com/singleflower.php?name=Forget-me-not |archive-date=February 24, 2013 }}</ref>\n* The [[zodiac]] signs for the month of September are [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] (until September 22) and [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] (September 23 onwards).<ref>The Earth passes the junction of the signs at 13:30 UT/GMT September 22, 2020, and will pass it again at 19:21 UT/GMT September 22, 2021.</ref><ref name=astrology>{{citation |title=Astrology Calendar |url=https://www.yourzodiacsign.com/calendar/ |website=yourzodiacsign}}.
