Do not change to \"is\"!--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the [[album era|rock era]]. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define [[hard rock]]. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist [[Mick Jagger]], multi-instrumentalist [[Brian Jones]], guitarist [[Keith Richards]], bassist [[Bill Wyman]], and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, and drove their sound and image. After [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. [[Jagger\u2013Richards|Jagger and Richards]] became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.\n\nRooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the Rolling Stones started out playing [[Cover version|covers]] and were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. They then found greater success with their own material, as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" (1965), \"[[Get Off of My Cloud]]\" (1965), and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" (1966) became international number-one [[Hit song|hits]]. ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 is considered the most important of their formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref> In 1967, they had the [[A-side and B-side|double-sided]] hit \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\"/\"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\" and experimented with [[psychedelic rock]] on ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]''. They returned to their [[rhythm and blues]] roots with hit songs such as \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\" (1968) and \"[[Honky Tonk Women]]\" (1969), and albums such as ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), featuring \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\", and ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), featuring \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]\" and \"[[Gimme Shelter]]\". ''Let It Bleed'' was the first of five consecutive number-one albums in the UK.\n\nJones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by guitarist [[Mick Taylor]]. That year they were first introduced on stage as \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World]]\". ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), which yielded \"[[Brown Sugar (Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]\" and included the first usage of their [[tongue and lips logo]], was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972), featuring \"[[Tumbling Dice]]\", and ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' (1973), yielding the hit ballad \"[[Angie (song)|Angie]]\", were also best sellers. Taylor was replaced by [[Ronnie Wood]] in 1974. The band continued to release successful albums, including their two largest sellers: ''[[Some Girls]]'' (1978), featuring \"[[Miss You (Rolling Stones song)|Miss You]]\", and ''[[Tattoo You]]'' (1981), featuring \"[[Start Me Up]]\". ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989) was widely considered a [[Comeback (publicity)|comeback album]] and was followed by ''[[Voodoo Lounge]]'' (1994), a worldwide number-one album. Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007 they had recorded the all-time [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tour]] three times, and as recent as 2021 they were the highest-earning live act of the year. From Wyman's departure in 1993 to Watts' death in 2021, the band continued as a four-piece core, with [[Darryl Jones]] playing bass on tour and on most studio recordings. Their 2016 album, ''[[Blue & Lonesome (Rolling Stones album)|Blue & Lonesome]]'', became their [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|twelfth UK number-one album]].\n\nThe Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 200&nbsp;million make them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. The band has won three [[Grammy Award]]s and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' have ranked the band as one of the greatest of all time.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Blue Plaque for the Rolling Stones at Dartford Railway Station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue plaque]] commemorating Jagger and Richards meeting on platform 2 at [[Dartford railway station]] in Dartford, Kent, on 17 October 1961]]\n\n[[Keith Richards]] and [[Mick Jagger]] became classmates and childhood friends in 1950 in [[Dartford]], [[Kent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstones.com/artist/mick-jagger/|title=Mick Jagger {{!}} The Rolling Stones |website=The Rolling Stones|access-date=2 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903121800/http://www.rollingstones.com/artist/mick-jagger/|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>White, Charles.
