The group is among the founders of the [[industrial rock]] and [[electro-industrial]] genres. Initially envisioned as an experimental side-project by [[cEvin Key]] (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band [[Images in Vogue]], Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist [[Nivek Ogre]] (Kevin Ogilvie).\n\nOver the course of 13 studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included [[Dwayne Goettel]] (1986\u20131995, also died in 1995), [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie]] (long-time associate and producer from 1984\u20131996, and an official member from 1987\u20131988; not a relative of Kevin Ogilvie), [[Bill Leeb]] (1984\u20131986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), [[Mark Walk]] (2003\u2013present), and a number of guests, including [[Al Jourgensen]] (1989), [[Danny Carey]] (2004), and many others.\n\nAfter the self-release of their first cassette demo in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label [[Nettwerk]], anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut ''[[Remission (Skinny Puppy album)|Remission]]'' in 1984 to their 1992 album ''[[Last Rights (album)|Last Rights]]'', Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated [[cult following]],<ref name=\"Chartattack 2001-07-20\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/29387/doomsday-comes-for-skinny-puppy-fans|title=Doomsday Comes For Skinny Puppy Fans|access-date=16 May 2007|publisher=[[Chartattack]]|date=20 July 2001|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607101127/http://www.chartattack.com/news/29387/doomsday-comes-for-skinny-puppy-fans|archive-date=7 June 2011}}</ref> fusing elements of [[industrial music|industrial]], [[funk music|funk]],\n[[noise music|noise]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[electro music|electro]], and rock music and making innovative use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as [[chemical warfare]] and [[animal testing]].\n\nIn 1993, Skinny Puppy left Nettwerk and long-time producer Rave, signing with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] and relocating to [[Malibu, California]], where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, ''[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|The Process]]'' (1996). Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a heroin overdose two months later. Key and Ogre, already active in [[List of Skinny Puppy side projects|a number of other projects]], went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the [[Doomsday Festival]] in [[Dresden]], Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with producer Mark Walk, they released their ninth album, ''[[The Greater Wrong of the Right]]'' (2004), which was followed by the release of the albums ''[[Mythmaker]]'' (2007) and ''[[HanDover]]'' (2011). In 2013, they released the album ''[[Weapon (album)|Weapon]]'', which was inspired by allegations that their music had been used for [[torture]] in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and first releases (1982\u20131985)===\nSkinny Puppy formed in 1982 as a side project for Kevin Crompton in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.<ref name=\"Reed (2013) p. 172\">{{harvnb|Reed|2013|p=172}}</ref> Crompton was dissatisfied with the pop direction of the band he was in, [[Images in Vogue]], and began Skinny Puppy with the intention of doing something more compelling and experimental.<ref name=IiVbio>{{cite web|last1=Mercer|first1=Laurie|title=Images in Vogue Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/images-in-vogue-mn0000910004|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701221852/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/images-in-vogue-mn0000910004|archive-date=1 July 2016}}</ref> Images in Vogue had become a popular act in [[Vancouver]], achieving several radio hits<ref name=\"GeoStraight\">{{cite web|last1=Lucas|first1=John|title=From the Vault: A Vancouver Classic by Images in Vogue|url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/612136/vault-vancouver-classic-images-vogue|website=The Georgia Straight|date=9 January 2016|publisher=straight.com|access-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916211327/http://www.straight.com/blogra/612136/vault-vancouver-classic-images-vogue|archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> and opening for groups such as [[Duran Duran]], [[Depeche Mode]], and [[Roxy Music]].<ref name=\"PNTinterview\">{{cite web|last1=Burnsilver|first1=Glenn|title=Skinny Puppy's Music Was Used for Torture, So They Invoiced the Government|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/skinny-puppys-music-was-used-for-torture-so-they-invoiced-the-government-6588359|website=Phoenix New Times|publisher=phoenixnewtimes.com|access-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716204958/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/skinny-puppys-music-was-used-for-torture-so-they-invoiced-the-government-6588359|archive-date=16 July 2016}}</ref> Crompton had planned Skinny Puppy to be a side project while he continued his work in Images in Vogue; however, when Images in Vogue relocated to [[Toronto]], Crompton made Skinny Puppy his full-time project.<ref name=\"IIV\">{{cite web|url=http://imagesinvogue.ca/history.html|title=A Short History|publisher=The Official Images in Vogue Site|access-date=27 April 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216221832/http://imagesinvogue.ca/history.html |archive-date=16 February 2006}}</ref> Crompton had already created the name for the project and recorded several songs when he asked Kevin Graham Ogilvie to join.

Key would continue to drum for Images in Vogue until the group relocated to Toronto in 1985.<ref name=\"Barclay et al (2011) p. 507\" /> Key's concept behind Skinny Puppy came from the group's first song ever recorded, \"K-9\". The idea, according to Key, was to create music which explored \"life as seen through a dog's eyes\".<ref name=\"Barclay et al (2011) p. 507\" /><ref name=Gilmore /> Skinny Puppy also incorporated the use of \"B-grade horror movie visuals\", including fake blood and props, into their live performances.{{sfn|Barclay et al.|2011|p= 510}} Key justified these \"shock gore\" antics with the following:\n\n<blockquote>What we're presenting isn't much different from what [the audience] is subjected to in everyday life.
