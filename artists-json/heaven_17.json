The band were a trio for most of their career, composed of [[Martyn Ware]] (keyboards) and [[Ian Craig Marsh]] (keyboards) (both previously of [[the Human League]]), and [[Glenn Gregory]] (vocals, keyboards). Although most of the band's music was recorded in the 1980s, they have occasionally reformed to record and perform, playing their first ever live concerts in 1997.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> Marsh left the band in 2007 and Ware and Gregory continued to perform as Heaven 17.\n\n==History==\n===1980s===\n====Origin and Formation====\n[[Ian Craig Marsh]] and [[Martyn Ware]] were the founding members of pioneering Sheffield electro-pop or synthpop group [[the Human League]]; Glenn Gregory (who had previously been in a punk band called Musical Vomit with Marsh) had been their original choice when seeking a lead singer for the band but as he had moved to London to work as a photographer at the time, they chose Ware's school friend [[Philip Oakey]] instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.classicpopmag.com/2022/03/glenn-gregory-heaven-17/ |title=Heaven 17: Glenn Gregory interview |publisher=Classic Pop Magazine |date=15 March 2022 |access-date=20 May 2022 }}</ref>  When personal and creative tensions within the group reached a breaking point in late 1980, Marsh and Ware left the band, ceding the Human League name to Oakey. They formed the production company [[British Electric Foundation]] (B.E.F.).<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited | location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| pages= 248\u2013249}}</ref>\n\n====1981: B.E.F. and Penthouse and Pavement====\nB.E.F.'s first [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] were a [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]-only album called ''Music For Stowaways''<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher=Reed International Books Ltd | location= London| page= 352| id= CN 5585}}</ref> and an LP called ''Music For Listening To'', which was re-released on CD in 1997 with two extra tracks. Shortly after, they completed their line-up when they recruited their friend, photographer Glenn Gregory, as vocalist. Taking their new name from a fictional pop band mentioned in [[Anthony Burgess]]'s [[Dystopian fiction|dystopian]] novel, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (where The Heaven Seventeen are at number 4 in the charts with \"Inside\"), Heaven 17 was intended to be just one of the musical projects for British Electric Foundation.<ref>David Buckley ''Electric Dreams: the Human League, Heaven 17, and the Sound of the Steel City'', Aurum Press 2012</ref> \n\nLike The Human League, Heaven 17 used synthesisers and [[drum machine]]s heavily (the [[Linn LM-1]] programmed by Ware). [[Session musician]]s were used for bass guitar and guitar (John Wilson) and [[grand piano]] (Nick Plytas). Whereas the band's former colleagues the Human League had gone on to major chart success in 1981, Heaven 17 struggled to make an impact. Their debut single \"[[(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang]]\" attracted some attention and, due to its overtly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing political]] lyrics, was banned by the [[BBC]] due to concerns by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]'s legal department that it libelled [[Ronald Reagan]], who had recently been elected President of the United States.<ref name=\"Banned\">{{cite book| title=Banned: Censorship of Popular Music in Britain: 1967-1992|first=Martin|last=Cloonan|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=1996|isbn=1-85742-300-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?as_isbn=9781857423006|page=117|quote = Radio 1 remained wary in the political arena and in 1981 its legal department advised Heaven 17 that their hit 'We Don't Need This Fascist Groove Thing' libelled American President Ronald Reagan by calling him a 'fascist'.

The tracks were [[cover version]]s of songs that Ware, Marsh and Gregory had grown up listening to. The album peaked at number 25. The second album was ''Geisha Boys and Temple Girls'' for the [[dance troupe]] [[Hot Gossip]], which used songs formerly recorded by the Human League and Heaven 17, and a track each from [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Talking Heads]].

However, in 1983 the band's fortunes changed.

American [[New wave music|new wave]] audiences were most familiar with \"Let Me Go\", which received high rotation [[airplay]] on [[alternative rock]] and new wave format radio stations such as Los Angeles, California's [[KROQ-FM]], and [[Long Island]], New York's [[WLIR]], plus frequent MTV exposure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/martyn_ware_of_heaven_17|title=Martyn Ware of Heaven 17|publisher=Songfacts|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n====1983-1985: Collaborations and How Men Are====\nTowards the end of 1983, the band (under their B.E.F. guise and assisted by Greg Walsh) helped relaunch [[Tina Turner]]'s career, producing, and providing backing vocals on her hit \"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\", a cover of the [[Al Green]] song. 1984 saw the release of Heaven 17's third studio album, ''[[How Men Are]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/how-men-are-mw0000742447|title=How Men Are|author=Badgley, Aaron|website=AllMusic|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref> which reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and was certified silver by the BPI. The album featured the [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] [[brass section]], and two singles from the album (\"[[Sunset Now]]\" and \"[[This Is Mine]]\") both reached the UK Top 40, but would be the band's last singles to do so until various remixes were released in the 1990s.\n\nThe band also worked on the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" at the end of 1984,<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2\">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher=Reed International Books Ltd | location= London| page= 399| id= CN 5585}}</ref> with Gregory supplying vocals alongside [[Midge Ure]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], after a personal request from Ure that he attend. However, the band did not perform at [[Live Aid]] the following year. Heaven 17's first \"live\" performance was in 1982 on the UK television programme ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' (though the band made use of backing tapes during this performance).\n\nIn 1985 Heaven 17 joined the [[Red Wedge]] collective.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rachel|first=Daniel|title=Walls Come Tumbling Down: The Music and Politics of Rock Against Racism, 2 Tone and Red Wedge|year=2016|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9781447272687}}</ref>\n\n====1986-1988: Critical and commercial decline====\nAfter the [[remix album]] ''Endless'' peaked at number 70 in July 1986, the band's fourth studio album ''[[Pleasure One]]'' was released in November 1986 and featured the single \"[[Trouble (Heaven 17 song)|Trouble]]\" (UK No. 51, Germany #17). The album contained a number of songs that were originally intended for a French film project that never came to be. This was also the first Heaven 17 album to not mention production credits for B.E.F. and the abbreviation would not appear again until the ''[[Bigger Than America]]'' album in 1996. It was followed up in 1988 with the album ''[[Teddy Bear, Duke & Psycho]]'' (featuring the singles \"Train of Love in Motion\" and \"[[The Ballad of Go Go Brown]]\"), although these two albums were poorly received and had little commercial success.

Remixes of \"[[(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang]]\" and \"Penthouse and Pavement\" were also minor hits in 1993.

In October of the same year, [[Virgin Records]] issued a [[Greatest hits album|greatest hits]] [[compilation album]] entitled ''Sight and Sound'', which included a previously-unheard version of \"Temptation\" with spoken vocals by an unknown student from Germany whom the band met in 1982.
