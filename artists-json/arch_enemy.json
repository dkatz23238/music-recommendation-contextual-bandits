Its members were in bands such as [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], [[Armageddon (Swedish band)|Armageddon]], [[Carnage (band)|Carnage]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Spiritual Beggars]], [[The Agonist]], [[Nevermore]], and [[Eucharist (band)|Eucharist]]. It was founded by [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] guitarist [[Michael Amott]] along with [[Johan Liiva]], who were both originally from the [[death metal]] band [[Carnage (band)|Carnage]]. The band has released eleven [[studio album]]s, three [[live album]]s, three [[video album]]s and four [[Extended play|EPs]]. The band was originally fronted by Johan Liiva, who was replaced by German vocalist [[Angela Gossow]] in 2000. Gossow left the band in March 2014 to become the group's manager and was replaced by Canadian vocalist [[Alissa White-Gluz]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years and ''Black Earth'' (1995\u20131997)===\nArch Enemy's debut album was ''[[Black Earth (Arch Enemy album)|Black Earth]]'', was recorded in [[Studio Fredman]] and released by the now defunct [[Regain Records|Wrong Again Records]] in 1996.\n\n===''Stigmata'', ''Burning Bridges'', and Gossow (1998\u20132000)===\n[[File:Arch Enemy (Erlandsson) 01.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Arch Enemy drummer Daniel Erlandsson]]\nAfter the release of ''Black Earth'' the band switched labels, signing a contract with [[Century Media Records|Century Media]]. In 1998 Arch Enemy released ''[[Stigmata (Arch Enemy album)|Stigmata]]'', for which bassist Martin Bengtsson and drummer Peter Wildoer joined the band. The album gained a wider audience and popularity in [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]]. This was also the first Arch Enemy album to be released worldwide.{{fact|date=August 2022}}\n\nIn 1999, [[Sharlee D'Angelo]] (ex-[[King Diamond]], ex-[[Mercyful Fate]]) assumed the role of Arch Enemy's bassist, and Daniel Erlandsson ([[Eucharist (band)|Eucharist]], ex-[[Carcass (band)|Carcass]]) was again recruited as the drummer. ''[[Burning Bridges (Arch Enemy album)|Burning Bridges]]'' was released, and was followed by the live album ''[[Burning Japan Live 1999]]''. During the touring-cycle for ''Burning Bridges'', D'Angelo was temporarily replaced twice; first by [[Dick L\u00f6vgren]] ([[Meshuggah]], ex-[[Armageddon (Swedish band)|Armageddon]]) and then by Roger Nilsson (ex-[[Spiritual Beggars]], [[Firebird (band)|Firebird]], [[The Quill (band)|the Quill]]).{{fact|date=August 2022}}\n\nIn November 2000, vocalist Johan Liiva left and was replaced by German death metal vocalist [[Angela Gossow]].{{fact|date=August 2022}}\n\n===''Wages of Sin'' and ''Anthems of Rebellion'' (2001\u20132004)===\nThe first album with songs featuring Gossow was ''[[Wages of Sin]]'', released in 2001. In December of the same year, Arch Enemy took part in the \"Japan's Beast Feast 2002\" concert, playing alongside [[Slayer]] and [[Mot\u00f6rhead]].\n\n''[[Anthems of Rebellion]]'' was released in 2003 and brought some innovations, such as the use of a second voice singing in harmony; such as in the \"End of the Line\" and \"Dehumanization\" tracks. In November of the following year, the band released the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Dead Eyes See No Future]]'', which featured live recordings, along with covers of [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] songs.
