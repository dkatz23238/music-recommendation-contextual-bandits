Drummer [[Mike Bordin]] and bassist [[Billy Gould]] joined afterwards. Morris called the name \"a piss-take on all the 'elegant' groups at the time\".<ref name=mike-morris>{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Mike|title=Faith No Man bio by Mike Morris|url=http://faithnoman.com/bio|access-date=October 1, 2014}}</ref> Later, he proposed the name Faith In No Man, but eventually the band settled on Bordin's suggestion, Faith No Man (stylized as Faith. No Man).<ref name=\"mike-morris\"/> The band recorded \"[[Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty]]\", released in 1983. The songs were recorded in [[Matt Wallace]]'s parents' garage, where Wallace had set up and been running a recording studio while the band was still recording under the name Sharp Young Men,<ref name=chriazi22>{{harvnb|Chirazi|1994|p=22}}</ref> with Morris, Gould, Bordin and Worthington. Worthington left shortly thereafter. The band's name was changed to Faith No Man for the release of the single, which featured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace's garage,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://old.fnm.com/faq/#4| title=Faith No More Frequently Answered Questions|website=Fnm.com| author=Agatha Samborska| access-date=November 5, 2011}}</ref> and Roddy Bottum replaced Worthington. Bottum, Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More. They chose the name in mid-1983 to accentuate the fact that \"The Man\" (Morris) was \"No More\". The band played with several vocalists and guitarists, including a brief stint with [[Courtney Love]], until it settled on vocalist [[Chuck Mosley]] in 1983<ref name=\"chuckdead\"/> and, later, guitarist [[Jim Martin (musician)|Jim Martin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chirazi|1994|pp=21\u201323}}</ref> Their first release under the Faith No More name was a self-titled cassette in 1983, which featured a live performance from that year on Side A, and a 20 minute instrumental track on Side B.\n\n===''We Care a Lot'' and ''Introduce Yourself'' (1985\u20131988)===\n[[File:Chuck Mosley.jpg|thumb|Faith No More's singer from 1984\u20131988, [[Chuck Mosley]] (photo from 2016)]]\nAfter the name change, the band initially started recording ''We Care a Lot'' without backing from a record label and, after pooling their money, recorded five songs. This gained the attention of Ruth Schwartz, who was then forming the independent label [[Mordam Records]], under which the band, after getting the necessary financial support, finished and released the album.
