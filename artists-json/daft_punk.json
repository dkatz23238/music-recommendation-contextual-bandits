Thank you.--> French [[electronic music]] duo formed in 1993 in Paris by [[Thomas Bangalter]] and [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]]. Widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in [[dance music]] history, they achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the [[French house]] movement. They garnered critical acclaim and commercial success in the years following, combining elements of [[house music]] with [[funk]], [[disco]], [[indie rock]] and [[Pop music|pop]].\n\nAfter Bangalter and Homem-Christo's [[indie rock]] band [[Darlin' (French band)|Darlin']] disbanded, they began experimenting with [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesiser]]s. Their debut studio album ''[[Homework (Daft Punk album)|Homework]]'' was released by [[Virgin Records]] in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by singles \"[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]\" and \"[[Da Funk]]\". From 1999, they assumed [[robot]] personas for their public appearances, with helmets, outfits and gloves to disguise their identities; they made few media appearances. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by [[Pedro Winter]], the head of [[Ed Banger Records]].\n\nDaft Punk's second album, ''[[Discovery (Daft Punk album)|Discovery]]'' (2001), had further success, supported by hit singles \"[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]\", \"[[Digital Love (Daft Punk song)|Digital Love]]\" and \"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\". It became the basis for an animated film, ''[[Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem|Interstella 5555]],'' supervised by a Japanese animator [[Leiji Matsumoto]]. Daft Punk's third album, ''[[Human After All]]'' (2005), received mixed reviews, though the singles \"[[Robot Rock (song)|Robot Rock]]\" and \"[[Technologic]]\" achieved success in the United Kingdom. The duo directed their first film, ''[[Electroma]]'', an avant-garde science fiction film, in 2006. They toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album ''[[Alive 2007]]'', which won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Electronic/Dance Album]];  the tour is credited for popularising dance music in North America. Daft Punk composed [[Tron: Legacy (soundtrack)|the score]] for the 2010 film ''[[Tron: Legacy]]''.\n\nIn 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for [[Columbia Records]] and released their fourth and final album, ''[[Random Access Memories]]'', to acclaim; the lead single, \"[[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]]\", reached the top 10 in the charts of 27 countries. ''Random Access Memories'' won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] for \"Get Lucky\". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their only number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with \"[[Starboy (song)|Starboy]]\", a collaboration with [[the Weeknd]]. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them the 12th greatest musical duo of all time.
