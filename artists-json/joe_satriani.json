Both lines were designed specifically for him as signature products. The Ibanez JS1 (the original JS model) was based on, and replaced, the Ibanez 540 Radius model that Satriani first endorsed. Many of his guitars are made by the company, including the JS1000 and JS1200. These guitars typically feature the [[DiMarzio]] PAF Pro (which he used up until 1993 in both the neck and bridge positions), the [[DiMarzio]] Fred (which he used in the bridge position from 1993 to 2005), and the Mo' Joe and the Paf Joe (which he has used in the bridge and neck positions from 2005 to the present). He has more recently introduced the [https://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/hum-canceling-strat/satch-track-neck Satch Track] single-coil pickup that he used in his Humbucker/Single coil-equipped signature Ibanez guitars. He has since replaced the Satch Track with the [https://www.sustainiac.com/ Sustainiac].\n\nThe JS line of guitars is Satriani's signature line, with the JS1000, JS1200, JS2400, JSBDG, and JS20th using Ibanez's original Edge double-locking tremolo bridge. The JS100 and JS120s both use Ibanez's Edge 3 tremolo bridge. The JS1600 is a fixed-bridge guitar with no tremolo system. The guitar he was most associated with during the 1990s was a chrome-finished guitar nicknamed \"Chrome Boy\". This instrument can be seen on the ''[[Live in San Francisco (Joe Satriani album)|Live in San Francisco]]'' DVD. However, the guitar used for most of the concert was in fact a lookalike nicknamed \"Pearly\", which featured [[Seymour Duncan]] Pearly Gates pickups.\n\nSatriani uses a number of other JS models, such as the JS double neck model, JS700 (primary axe on his self-titled CD, seen on the 1995 ''Joe Satriani'' tour, which features a fixed bridge, [[P-90]] pickups, and a matching mahogany body and neck), JS6/JS6000 (natural body), JS1 (the original JS model), JS2000 (fixed-bridge model), a variety of JS100s, JS1000s and JS1200s with custom paint work, and a large number of prototype JSs. All double-locking bridges have been the original Edge tremolo, not the newer models, which point to a more custom guitar than the off-the-shelf models. Satriani played a red 7-string JS model, seen in the ''G3 Live in Tokyo'' DVD from 2005. He also has a prototype 24-fret version of the JS, now called the JS\u20132400, which he has used with Chickenfoot. He has also used other prototypes featuring a Sustainiac or a JS model with three single coil-sized humbucker pickups.\n\nSatriani's guitars are usually equipped with his signature DiMarzio humbucker pickups, Mo' Joe and PAF Joe, and his 24-fret JS model features a signature single-coil-sized humbucker called the Satch Track in the neck position.<ref>{{cite web|title=DiMarzio Releases Satch Track, Joe Satriani's First Single-Coil-Size Signature Pickup|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/dimarzio-releases-satch-track-joe-satrianis-first-single-coil-size-signature-pickup|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420212901/http://www.guitarworld.com/dimarzio-releases-satch-track-joe-satrianis-first-single-coil-size-signature-pickup|archive-date=April 20, 2017}}</ref> Some of his guitars are still equipped with the pickup models he favored in the past, the DiMarzio FRED and PAF Pro pickups.\n\nSatriani has used a wide variety of [[guitar amps]], with [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] being his main amplifier (notably the limited-edition blue-colored 6100 LM model) up until 2001, and his Peavey signature series amps, the Peavey JSX, up until his time with Chickenfoot.\n\n[[File:JS Guitars 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Guitars used by Satriani during the 2013 ''[[Unstoppable Momentum]]'' tour.]]\nThe JSX began life as a prototype Peavey XXX and developed into the Joe Satriani signature Peavey model. However, Satriani still used distortion pedals with the clean channel rather than the built-in overdrive channels. He has used other amplifiers over the years in the studio, such as the Peavey 5150 (used to record the song \"[[Crystal Planet]]\"), Cornford, and the [[Mesa/Boogie]] Mark IIC+ (used to record the song \"[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]\"), among others. He later switched to the Marshall JVM series, having used a modified JVM 410H in his ''Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards'' tour in 2010 and with Chickenfoot in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThese modified JVM Marshall amps were prototypes for a signature amp that Marshall scheduled for release in 2011. They replaced the [[reverb]] with [[noise gate]]s that eliminate lag when switching channels. The clean channel was replaced by the clean channel of a 6100 LM model, which Satriani likes as an option to use [[distortion pedal]]s with. The orange [[od channel]] and the modern red overdrive channel have been better matched with each other as Satriani claims to prefer the organic overdrive of the JVM over pedals. The red overdrive channel was modified for a beefy rock rather than a [[nu metal]] sound. The effect loop has been simplified to be serial only.\n\nSatriani has used many amps in the studio when recording, including the Peavey Classic. He used Marshall heads and cabinets, including live, prior to his Peavey endorsement. Recently, he used the JSX head through a Palmer Speaker Simulator. He has released a Class-A 5-watt tube amp called the \"Mini Colossal\".
