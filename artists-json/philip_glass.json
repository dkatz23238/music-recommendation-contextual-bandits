His composition teachers included [[Vincent Persichetti]] and [[William Bergsma]]. Fellow students included [[Steve Reich]] and [[Peter Schickele]]. In 1959, he was a winner in the [[BMI Foundation]]'s BMI Student Composer Awards, an international prize for young composers. In the summer of 1960, he studied with [[Darius Milhaud]] at the summer school of the [[Aspen Music Festival]] and composed a violin concerto for a fellow student, Dorothy Pixley-Rothschild.<ref>Ev Grimes: \"Interview: Education\" in {{harvnb|Kostelanetz|1999|p=25}}</ref> After leaving [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] in 1962, Glass moved to [[Pittsburgh]] and worked as a school-based composer-in-residence in the public school system, composing various choral, chamber and orchestral music.{{sfn|Potter|2000|p=253}}\n\n===1964\u20131966: Paris===\nIn 1964, Glass received a [[Fulbright Scholarship]]; his studies in Paris with the eminent composition teacher [[Nadia Boulanger]], from autumn of 1964 to summer of 1966, influenced his work throughout his life, as the composer admitted in 1979: \"The composers I studied with Boulanger are the people I still think about most\u2014[[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].\"{{sfn|Kostelanetz|1999|page=109}}\n\nGlass later stated in his autobiography ''Music by Philip Glass'' (1987) that the new music performed at [[Pierre Boulez]]'s ''Domaine Musical'' concerts in Paris lacked any excitement for him (with the notable exceptions of music by [[John Cage]] and [[Morton Feldman]]), but he was deeply impressed by new films and theatre performances. His move away from modernist composers such as Boulez and Stockhausen was nuanced, rather than outright rejection: \"That generation wanted disciples and as we didn't join up it was taken to mean that we hated the music, which wasn't true. We'd studied them at Juilliard and knew their music. How on earth can you reject [[Luciano Berio|Berio]]? Those early works of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]] are still beautiful.

Together with Akalaitis (they married in 1965), Glass in turn attended performances by theatre groups including [[Jean-Louis Barrault]]'s [[Od\u00e9on]] theatre, [[The Living Theatre]] and the [[Berliner Ensemble]] in 1964 to 1965.{{sfn|Potter|2000|p=255}} These significant encounters resulted in a collaboration with Breuer for which Glass contributed music for a 1965 staging of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''Com\u00e9die'' (''[[Play (play)|Play]]'', 1963). The resulting piece (written for two [[soprano saxophone]]s) was directly influenced by the play's open-ended, repetitive and almost musical structure and was the first one of a series of four early pieces in a minimalist, yet still [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]], idiom.<ref name=Schwarz /> After ''Play'', Glass also acted in 1966 as music director of a Breuer production of [[Brecht]]'s ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'', featuring the theatre score by [[Paul Dessau]].\n\nIn parallel with his early excursions in experimental theatre, Glass worked in winter 1965 and spring 1966 as a music director and composer{{sfn|Potter|2000|pp=257\u2013258}} on a film score (''[[Chappaqua (film)|Chappaqua]]'', Conrad Rooks, 1966) with [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Alla Rakha]], which added another important influence on Glass's musical thinking. His distinctive style arose from his work with Shankar and Rakha and their perception of rhythm in Indian music as being entirely additive. He renounced all his compositions in a moderately modern style resembling Milhaud's, [[Aaron Copland]]'s, and [[Samuel Barber]]'s, and began writing pieces based on repetitive structures of Indian music and a sense of time influenced by [[Samuel Beckett]]: a piece for two actresses and chamber ensemble, a work for chamber ensemble and his first numbered string quartet (No. 1, 1966).<ref>Joan La Barbara: \"Philip Glass and Steve Reich: Two from the Steady State School\" in {{harvnb|Kostelanetz|1999|pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\nGlass then left Paris for northern India in 1966, where he came in contact with [[Tibet]]an refugees and began to gravitate towards [[Buddhism]]. He met [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], in 1972, and has been a strong supporter of the Tibetan independence ever since.\n\n===1967\u20131974: Minimalism: From ''Strung Out'' to ''Music in 12 Parts''===\n{{See also|Minimalist music}}\n\n{{quote box||align=|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=Glass' musical style is instantly recognizable, with its trademark churning [[ostinato]]s, undulating [[arpeggio]]s and repeating rhythms that morph over various lengths of time atop broad fields of tonal harmony.

The visual artist Richard Serra provided Glass with Gallery contacts, while both collaborated on various sculptures, films and installations; from 1971 to 1974 he became Serra's regular studio assistant.<ref name=\"Potter, pp. 266\u2013269\" /><ref>Richard Serra, ''Writings Interviews'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1994, p. 7</ref>\n\nBetween summer of 1967 and the end of 1968, Glass composed nine works, including ''Strung Out'' (for amplified solo violin, composed in summer of 1967), Gradus (for solo saxophone, 1968), ''Music in the Shape of a Square'' (for two flutes, composed in May 1968, an homage to [[Erik Satie]]), ''How Now'' (for solo piano, 1968) and ''1+1'' (for amplified tabletop, November 1968) which were \"clearly designed to experiment more fully with his new-found minimalist approach\".{{sfn|Potter|2000|p=277}} The first concert of Glass's new music was at [[Jonas Mekas]]'s Film-Makers Cinemath\u00e8que ([[Anthology Film Archives]]) in September 1968. This concert included the first work of this series with ''Strung Out'' (performed by the violinist Pixley-Rothschild) and ''Music in the Shape of a Square'' (performed by Glass and Gibson). The musical scores were tacked on the wall, and the performers had to move while playing. Glass's new works met with a very enthusiastic response by the audience which consisted mainly of visual and performance artists who were highly sympathetic to Glass's reductive approach.\n\nApart from his music career, Glass had a [[moving company]] with his cousin, the sculptor Jene Highstein, and also worked as a plumber and [[Taxicab|cab]] driver (during 1973 to 1978). He recounts installing a dishwasher and looking up from his work to see an astonished [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], ''Time'' magazine's art critic, staring at him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://interlude.hk/philip-glass-composer-taxi-driver/|title=Philip Glass: Composer and...Taxi Driver?|date=September 26, 2015|website=Interlude.hk|language=en-US|access-date=November 7, 2019}}</ref> During this time, he made friends with other New York-based artists such as [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Nancy Graves]], [[Michael Snow]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Laurie Anderson]], and [[Chuck Close]] (who created a now-famous portrait of Glass).<ref>Glass in conversation with Chuck Close and William Bartman, in, Joanne Kesten (ed.), The Portraits Speak: Chuck Close in conversation with 27 of his subjects, A.R.T. Press, New York, 1997, p. 170</ref> (Glass returned the compliment in 2005 with ''A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close'' for piano.)\n\nWith ''1+1'' and ''Two Pages'' (composed in February 1969) Glass turned to a more \"rigorous approach\" to his \"most basic minimalist technique, additive process\",{{sfn|Potter|2000|p=252}} pieces which were followed in the same year by ''Music in Contrary Motion'' and ''Music in Fifths'' (a kind of homage to his composition teacher [[Nadia Boulanger]], who pointed out \"[[hidden fifths]]\" in his works but regarded them as cardinal sins). Eventually Glass's music grew less austere, becoming more complex and dramatic, with pieces such as ''Music in Similar Motion'' (1969), and ''Music with Changing Parts'' (1970). These pieces were performed by The Philip Glass Ensemble in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in 1969 and in the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in 1970, often encountering hostile reaction from critics,<ref name=Schwarz /> but Glass's music was also met with enthusiasm from younger artists such as [[Brian Eno]] and [[David Bowie]] (at the Royal College of Art ca. 1970).{{sfn|Potter|2000|p=340}} Eno described this encounter with Glass's music as one of the \"most extraordinary musical experiences of [his] life\", as a \"viscous bath of pure, thick energy\", concluding \"this was actually the most detailed music I'd ever heard. It was all intricacy, exotic [[harmonic]]s\".<ref>Tim Page, booklet notes to the album ''Einstein on the Beach'', Nonesuch 1993</ref> In 1970 Glass returned to the theatre, composing music for the theatre group Mabou Mines, resulting in his first minimalist pieces employing voices: ''Red Horse Animation'' and ''Music for Voices'' (both 1970, and premiered at the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]]).<ref>Booklet notes to the recording ''Early Voice'', Orange Mountain Music, 2002</ref>\n\nAfter differences of opinion with Steve Reich in 1971,<ref name=Schwarz /> Glass formed the [[Philip Glass Ensemble]] (while Reich formed [[Steve Reich and Musicians]]), an amplified ensemble including keyboards, wind instruments (saxophones, flutes), and [[soprano]] voices.\n\nGlass's music for his ensemble culminated in the four-hour-long ''[[Music in Twelve Parts]]'' (1971\u20131974), which began as a single piece with twelve instrumental parts but developed into a cycle that summed up Glass's musical achievement since 1967, and even transcended it\u2014the last part features a [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] theme, sung by the soprano voice of the ensemble. \"I had broken the rules of [[modernism (music)|modernism]] and so I thought it was time to break some of my own rules\", according to Glass.<ref name=timpage>Tim Page: \"Music in 12 Parts\" in {{harvnb|Kostelanetz|1999|page=98}}</ref> Though he finds the term minimalist inaccurate to describe his later work, Glass does accept this term for pieces up to and including ''Music in 12 Parts'', excepting this last part which \"was the end of minimalism\" for Glass.

For Glass this series demonstrated a new start, hence the title: \"What I was looking for was a way of combining harmonic progression with the rhythmic structure I had been developing, to produce a new overall structure. ... I'd taken everything out with my early works and it was now time to decide just what I wanted to put in\u2014a process that would occupy me for several years to come.\"<ref name=timpage /> Parts 1 and 2 of \"Another Look at Harmony\" were included in a collaboration with [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], a piece of musical theater later designated by Glass as the first opera of his portrait opera trilogy: ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]''. Composed in spring to fall of 1975 in close collaboration with Wilson, Glass's first opera was first premiered in summer 1976 at the [[Festival d'Avignon]], and in November of the same year to a mixed and partly enthusiastic reaction from the audience at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City. Scored for the Philip Glass Ensemble, solo violin, chorus, and featuring actors (reciting texts by [[Christopher Knowles]], [[Lucinda Childs]] and Samuel M. Johnson), Glass's and Wilson's essentially plotless opera was conceived as a \"[[metaphorical]] look at [[Albert Einstein]]: scientist, humanist, amateur musician\u2014and the man whose theories ... led to the splitting of the atom\", evoking [[nuclear holocaust]] in the climactic scene, as critic [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]] pointed out.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tim Page, liner notes to the recording of ''Einstein on the Beach'', Nonesuch Records 1993</ref> As with ''Another Look at Harmony'', \"''Einstein'' added a new functional harmony that set it apart from the early conceptual works\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Composer [[Tom Johnson (composer)|Tom Johnson]] came to the same conclusion, comparing the solo violin music to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and the \"organ figures ... to those [[Alberti bass]]es [[Mozart]] loved so much\".{{sfn|Kostelanetz|1999|page=58}} The piece was praised by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as \"one of the seminal artworks of the century\".\n\n''Einstein on the Beach'' was followed by further music for projects by the theatre group Mabou Mines such as ''Dressed like an Egg'' (1975), and again music for plays and adaptations from prose by [[Samuel Beckett]], such as ''[[The Lost Ones (Beckett)|The Lost Ones]]'' (1975), ''Cascando'' (1975), ''[[Mercier and Camier]]'' (1979). Glass also turned to other media; two multi-movement instrumental works for the Philip Glass Ensemble originated as music for film and TV: ''North Star'' (1977 score for the documentary ''[[North Star: Mark di Suvero]]'' by Fran\u00e7ois de Menil and [[Barbara Rose]]) and four short cues for the children's TV series ''[[Sesame Street]]'' named ''Geometry of Circles'' (1979).\n\nAnother series, ''Fourth Series'' (1977\u201379), included music for chorus and organ (\"Part One\", 1977), organ and piano (\"Part Two\" and \"Part Four\", 1979), and music for a radio adaption of [[Constance DeJong (writer)|Constance DeJong]]'s novel ''Modern Love'' (\"Part Three\", 1978). \"Part Two\" and \"Part Four\" were used (and hence renamed) in two dance productions by choreographer [[Lucinda Childs]] (who had already contributed to and performed in ''Einstein on the Beach''). \"Part Two\" was included in ''Dance'' (a collaboration with visual artist [[Sol LeWitt]], 1979), and \"Part Four\" was renamed as ''Mad Rush'', and performed by Glass on several occasions such as the first public appearance of the 14th Dalai Lama in New York City in Fall 1981. The piece demonstrates Glass's turn to more traditional models: the composer added a conclusion to an open-structured piece which \"can be interpreted as a sign that he [had] abandoned the radical non-narrative, undramatic approaches of his early period\", as the pianist Steffen Schleiermacher points out.<ref>Steffen Schleiermacher, booklet notes to his recording of Glass's \"Early Keyboard Music\", MDG Records, 2001</ref>\n\nIn Spring 1978, Glass received a commission from the [[De Nederlandse Opera|Netherlands Opera]] (as well as a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant) which \"marked the end of his need to earn money from non-musical employment\".{{sfn|Potter|2000|p=260}} With the commission Glass continued his work in music theater, composing his opera ''[[Satyagraha (opera)|Satyagraha]]'' (composed in 1978\u20131979, premiered in 1980 at Rotterdam), based on the early life of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in South Africa, [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] For ''Satyagraha'', Glass worked in close collaboration with two \"[[SoHo]] friends\": the writer Constance deJong, who provided the libretto, and the set designer Robert Israel. This piece was in other ways a turning point for Glass, as it was his first work since 1963 scored for symphony orchestra, even if the most prominent parts were still reserved for solo voices and chorus. Shortly after completing the score in August 1979, Glass met the conductor [[Dennis Russell Davies]], whom he helped prepare for performances in Germany (using a piano-four-hands version of the score); together they started to plan another opera, to be premiered at the [[Staatsoper Stuttgart|Stuttgart State Opera]].<ref name=musicby />\n\n===1980\u20131986: Completing the Portrait Trilogy: ''Akhnaten'' and beyond===\nWhile planning a third part of his \"Portrait Trilogy\", Glass turned to smaller music theatre projects such as the non-narrative ''Madrigal Opera'' (for six voices and violin and viola, 1980), and ''[[The Photographer]]'', a biographic study on the photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] (1982). Glass also continued to write for the orchestra with the score of ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' ([[Godfrey Reggio]], 1981\u20131982). Some pieces which were not used in the film (such as ''Fa\u00e7ades'') eventually appeared on the album ''[[Glassworks (composition)|Glassworks]]'' (1982, CBS Records), which brought Glass's music to a wider public.\n\nThe \"Portrait Trilogy\" was completed with ''[[Akhnaten (opera)|Akhnaten]]'' (1982\u20131983, premiered in 1984), a vocal and orchestral composition sung in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Biblical Hebrew]], and [[Ancient Egyptian]]. In addition, this opera featured an actor reciting ancient Egyptian texts in the language of the audience. ''Akhnaten'' was commissioned by the Stuttgart Opera in a production designed by [[Achim Freyer]]. It premiered simultaneously at the Houston Opera in a production directed by David Freeman and designed by [[Peter Sellars]]. At the time of the commission, the Stuttgart Opera House was undergoing renovation, necessitating the use of a nearby playhouse with a smaller orchestra pit. Upon learning this, Glass and conductor Dennis Russell Davies visited the playhouse, placing music stands around the pit to determine how many players the pit could accommodate. The two found they could not fit a full orchestra in the pit. Glass decided to eliminate the violins, which had the effect of \"giving the orchestra a low, dark sound that came to characterize the piece and suited the subject very well\".<ref name=musicby /> As Glass remarked in 1992, ''Akhnaten'' is significant in his work since it represents a \"first extension out of a [[triad (music)|triadic harmonic]] language\", an experiment with the [[polytonality]] of his teachers Persichetti and Milhaud, a musical technique which Glass compares to \"an optical illusion, such as in the paintings of [[Josef Albers]]\".{{sfn|Kostelanetz|1999|page=269}}\n\nGlass again collaborated with [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] on another opera, ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down|the CIVIL warS]]'' (1983, premiered in 1984), which also functioned as the final part (\"the Rome section) of Wilson's epic work by the same name, originally planned for an \"international arts festival that would accompany the Olympic Games in Los Angeles\".<ref>David Wright, booklet notes to the first recording of the opera, released on Nonesuch Records, 1999</ref> (Glass also composed a prestigious work for chorus and orchestra for the opening of the Games, ''The Olympian: Lighting of the Torch and Closing ''). The premiere of ''The CIVIL warS'' in Los Angeles never materialized and the opera was in the end premiered at the Opera of Rome. Glass's and Wilson's opera includes musical settings of Latin texts by the 1st-century-Roman playwright [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and allusions to the music of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and from the [[American Civil War]], featuring the 19th century figures [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] as characters.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Glass produced \"works in different media at an extraordinarily rapid pace\".{{sfn|Schwarz|1996|p=151}} Projects from that period include music for dance ([[Glass Pieces]] choreographed for [[New York City Ballet]] by [[Jerome Robbins]] in 1983 to a score drawn from existing Glass compositions created for other media including an excerpt from ''Akhnaten''; and ''In the Upper Room'', [[Twyla Tharp]], 1986), music for theatre productions ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'' (1984) and ''[[String Quartet No. 2 (Glass)|Company]]'' (1983). Beckett vehemently disapproved of the production of ''Endgame'' at the [[American Repertory Theater]] (Cambridge, Massachusetts), which featured [[JoAnne Akalaitis]]'s direction and Glass's ''Prelude'' for timpani and double bass, but in the end, he authorized the music for ''Company'', four short, intimate pieces for [[string quartet]] that were played in the intervals of the dramatization. This composition was initially regarded by the composer as a piece of [[Gebrauchsmusik]] ('music for use')\u2014\"like salt and pepper ... just something for the table\", as he noted.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=John|last=Seabrook|author-link=John Seabrook|title=Glass's Master Class|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date=March 20, 2006|access-date=September 27, 2021|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/03/20/glasss-master-class}}</ref> Eventually ''Company'' was published as Glass's String Quartet No. 2 and in a version for string orchestra, being performed by ensembles ranging from student orchestras to renowned formations such as the [[Kronos Quartet]] and the [[Kremerata Baltica]].\n\nThis interest in writing for the [[string quartet]] and the string orchestra led to a chamber and orchestral film score for ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]'' ([[Paul Schrader]], 1984\u201385), which Glass recently described as his \"musical turning point\" that developed his \"technique of film scoring in a very special way\".<ref name=\"watchnewspapers1\">{{cite web|first=Greta|last=Stetson|title=Philip Glass wishes he had time to take a four-hour hike|url=http://watchnewspapers.com/printer_friendly/2919214|publisher=watchnewspapers.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209013953/http://watchnewspapers.com/printer_friendly/2919214|archive-date=February 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nGlass also dedicated himself to vocal works with two sets of songs, ''Three Songs for chorus'' (1984, settings of poems by [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Octavio Paz]] and [[Raymond L\u00e9vesque]]), and a song cycle initiated by [[CBS Masterworks Records]]: ''[[Songs from Liquid Days]]'' (1985), with texts by songwriters such as [[David Byrne]], [[Paul Simon]], in which the [[Kronos Quartet]] is featured (as it is in ''Mishima'') in a prominent role. Glass also continued his series of operas with adaptations from literary texts such as ''The Juniper Tree'' (an opera collaboration with composer [[Robert Moran]], 1984), [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' (1987), and also worked with novelist [[Doris Lessing]] on the opera ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (opera)|The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' (1985\u201386, and performed by the [[Houston Grand Opera]] and [[English National Opera]] in 1988).\n\n===1987\u20131991: Operas and the turn to symphonic music===\nCompositions such as ''Company'', ''Facades'' and String Quartet No. 3 (the last two extracted from the scores to ''Koyaanisqatsi'' and ''Mishima'') gave way to a series of works more accessible to ensembles such as the [[string quartet]] and [[symphony orchestra]], in this returning to the structural roots of his student days. In taking this direction his [[chamber music|chamber]] and orchestral works were also written in a more and more traditional and lyrical style. In these works, Glass often employs old musical forms such as the [[chaconne]] and the [[passacaglia]]\u2014for instance in ''[[Satyagraha (opera)|Satyagraha]]'',<ref name=Schwarz /> the [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Glass)|Violin Concerto No. 1]] (1987), [[Symphony No. 3 (Glass)|Symphony No. 3]] (1995), ''Echorus'' (1995) and also recent works such as [[Symphony No. 8 (Glass)|Symphony No. 8]] (2005),<ref>Philip Glass, booklet notes to the Album ''Symphony No. 8'', Orange Mountain Music, 2006</ref> and ''Songs and Poems for Solo Cello'' (2006).\n\nA series of orchestral works originally composed for the concert hall commenced with the 3-movement [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Glass)|Violin Concerto No. 1]] (1987). This work was commissioned by the [[American Composers Orchestra]] and written for and in close collaboration with the violinist [[Paul Zukofsky]] and the conductor Dennis Russel Davies, who since then has encouraged the composer to write numerous orchestral pieces. The Concerto is dedicated to the memory of Glass's father: \"His favorite form was the violin concerto, and so I grew up listening to the [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn]], the [[Paganini]], the [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Brahms]] concertos. ...

This turn to orchestral music was continued with a symphonic trilogy of \"portraits of nature\", commissioned by the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], the [[Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra]], and the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]]: ''[[The Light (Glass)|The Light]]'' (1987), ''The Canyon'' (1988), and ''[[Itaipu (composition)|Itaipu]]'' (1989).\n\nWhile composing for symphonic ensembles, Glass also composed music for piano, with the cycle of five movements titled ''Metamorphosis'' (adapted from music for a theatrical adaptation of [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''), and for the [[Errol Morris]] film ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'', 1988. In the same year Glass met the poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] by chance in a book store in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] of New York City, and they immediately \"decided on the spot to do something together, reached for one of Allen's books and chose ''[[Wichita Vortex Sutra]]''\",<ref>Booklet notes by Jody Dalton to the album ''Solo Piano'', CBS, 1989</ref> a piece for reciter and piano which in turn developed into a music theatre piece for singers and ensemble, ''[[Hydrogen Jukebox]]'' (1990).\n\nGlass also returned to chamber music; he composed two String Quartets ([[String Quartet No. 4 (Glass)|No. 4 ''Buczak'']] in 1989 and No. 5 in 1991), and chamber works which originated as incidental music for plays, such as ''Music from \"The Screens\"'' (1989/1990). This work originated in one of many theater music collaborations with the director [[JoAnne Akalaitis]], who originally asked the [[Music of the Gambia|Gambian]] musician [[Foday Musa Suso]] \"to do the score [for [[Jean Genet]]'s \"The Screens\"] in collaboration with a western composer\".<ref>Booklet notes by Philip Glass to the album \"Music from the Screens\", Point Music, 1993</ref> Glass had already collaborated with Suso in the film score to ''[[Powaqqatsi]]'' ([[Godfrey Reggio]], 1988). ''Music from \"The Screens\"'' is on occasion a touring piece for Glass and Suso (one set of tours also included percussionist [[Yousif Sheronick]] ), and individual pieces found its way to the repertoire of Glass and the cellist Wendy Sutter. Another collaboration was a collaborative recording project with [[Ravi Shankar]], initiated by [[Peter Baumann]] (a member of the band [[Tangerine Dream]]), which resulted in the album ''[[Passages (Ravi Shankar and Philip Glass album)|Passages]]'' (1990).\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Glass's projects also included two highly prestigious opera commissions based on the life of explorers:\n\n''[[The Voyage (opera)|The Voyage]]'' (1992), with a libretto by [[David Henry Hwang]], was commissioned by the [[Metropolitan Opera]] for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America by [[Christopher Columbus]]; and ''[[White Raven (opera)|White Raven]]'' (1991), about [[Vasco da Gama]], a collaboration with Robert Wilson and composed for the closure of the [[Expo '98|1998 World Fair]] in Lisbon. Especially in ''The Voyage'', the composer \"explore[d] new territory\", with its \"newly arching lyricism\", \"[[Jean Sibelius|Sibelian]] starkness and sweep\", and \"dark, brooding tone ... a reflection of its increasingly [[chromatic]] (and [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]]) palette\", as one commentator put it.<ref name=Schwarz />\n\nGlass remixed the [[S'Express]] song \"Hey Music Lover\", for the b-side of its 1989 release as a single.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=But Is it Music?|series=In Their Own Words; 20th-Century Composers|network= BBC |date= March 21, 2014 |number= 2 }}</ref>\n\n===1991\u20131996: Cocteau trilogy and symphonies===\nAfter these operas, Glass began working on a symphonic cycle, commissioned by the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who told Glass at the time: \"I'm not going to let you ... be one of those opera composers who never write a [[symphony]]\".{{sfn|Maycock|2002|p=71}} Glass responded with two 3-movement symphonies (''[[Symphony No. 1 (Glass)|\"Low\"]]'' [1992], and [[Symphony No. 2 (Glass)|Symphony No. 2]] [1994]); his first in an ongoing series of symphonies is a combination of the composer's own musical material with themes featured in prominent tracks of the David Bowie/Brian Eno album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977),<ref>Booklet notes by Philip Glass to the album ''Low Symphony'', Point Music, 1993</ref> whereas Symphony No. 2 is described by Glass as a study in [[polytonality]]. He referred to the music of [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], and [[Heitor Villa-Lobos|Villa-Lobos]] as possible models for his symphony.<ref>Booklet notes by Philip Glass to the album ''Symphony No. 2'', Nonesuch, 1998</ref> With the Concerto Grosso (1992), [[Symphony No. 3 (Glass)|Symphony No. 3]] (1995), a Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra (1995), written for the [[Rasch\u00e8r Saxophone Quartet|Rascher Quartet]] (all commissioned by conductor Dennis Russel Davies), and ''Echorus'' (1994/95), a more transparent, refined, and intimate chamber-orchestral style paralleled the excursions of his large-scale symphonic pieces. In the four movements of his Third Symphony, Glass treats a 19-piece string orchestra as an extended chamber ensemble. In the third movement, Glass re-uses the chaconne as a formal device; one commentator characterized Glass's symphony as one of the composer's \"most tautly unified works\".<ref>Booklet notes by Philip Glass to the album ''Symphony No. 3'', Nonesuch, 2000</ref>{{sfn|Maycock|2002|p=90}} The third Symphony was closely followed by a fourth, subtitled ''[[Symphony No. 4 (Glass)|Heroes]]'' (1996), commissioned the [[American Composers Orchestra]]. Its six movements are symphonic reworkings of themes by Glass, David Bowie, and Brian Eno (from their album ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'', 1977); as in other works by the composer, it is also a hybrid work and exists in two versions: one for the concert hall, and another, shorter one for dance, choreographed by [[Twyla Tharp]].\n[[File:Philip Glass 003.jpg|thumb|upright|Glass performing in Florence in 1993]]\nAnother commission by Dennis Russell Davies was a second series for piano, the ''Etudes'' for Piano (dedicated to Davies as well as the production designer [[Achim Freyer]]); the complete first set of ten Etudes has been recorded and performed by Glass himself. [[Bruce Brubaker]] and Dennis Russell Davies have each recorded the original set of six. Most of the Etudes are composed in the post-minimalist and increasingly lyrical style of the times: \"Within the framework of a concise form, Glass explores possible sonorities ranging from typically Baroque passagework to Romantically tinged moods\".<ref>Booklet notes by Oliver Binder to \"American Piano music\", Initativkreis Ruhr/Orange Mountain Music 2009</ref> Some of the pieces also appeared in different versions such as in the theatre music to Robert Wilson's ''Persephone'' (1994, commissioned by the Relache Ensemble) or ''Echorus'' (a version of Etude No. 2 for two violins and string orchestra, written for Edna Mitchell and [[Yehudi Menuhin]] 1995).\n\nGlass's prolific output in the 1990s continued to include operas with an opera [[triptych]] (1991\u20131996), which the composer described as an \"homage\" to writer and film director [[Jean Cocteau]], based on his prose and cinematic work: ''[[Orph\u00e9e]]'' (1949), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|La Belle et la B\u00eate]]'' (1946), and the novel ''[[Les Enfants terribles]]'' (1929, later made into a film by Cocteau and [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], 1950). In the same way the triptych is also a musical homage to the work of the group of French composers associated with Cocteau, [[Les Six]] (and especially to Glass's teacher Darius Milhaud), as well as to various 18th-century composers such as Gluck and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] whose music featured as an essential part of the films by Cocteau.\n\nThe inspiration of the first part of the trilogy, ''Orph\u00e9e'' (composed in 1991, and premiered in 1993 at the [[American Repertory Theatre]]) can be conceptually and musically traced to [[Gluck]]'s opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' (''Orph\u00e9e et Euridyce'', 1762/1774),<ref name=Schwarz /> which had a prominent part in Cocteau's 1949 film ''Orphee''.<ref>Paul Barnes in his booklet notes to the album \"The Orph\u00e9e Suite for Piano, Orange Mountain Music, 2003</ref> One theme of the opera, the death of [[Eurydice]], has some similarity to the composer's personal life: the opera was composed after the unexpected death in 1991 of Glass's wife, artist [[Candy Jernigan]]: \"... One can only suspect that Orpheus' grief must have resembled the composer's own\", K. Robert Schwartz suggests.<ref name=Schwarz /> The opera's \"transparency of texture, a subtlety of instrumental color, ... a newly expressive and unfettered vocal writing\"<ref name=Schwarz /> was praised, and ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' critic remarked \"Glass has a real affinity for the French text and sets the words eloquently, underpinning them with delicately patterned instrumental textures\".<ref>{{citation |first=Andrew |last=Clements |periodical=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=June 2, 2005 |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/classical/andrewclements/story/0,,1918357,00.html |title=Orph\u00e9e |access-date=November 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFor the second opera, ''La Belle et la B\u00eate'' (1994, scored for either the Philip Glass Ensemble or a more conventional chamber orchestra), Glass replaced the soundtrack (including [[Georges Auric]]'s film music) of Cocteau's film, wrote \"a new fully operatic score and synchronize[d] it with the film\".<ref name=Cott /> The final part of the triptych returned again to a more traditional setting with the \"Dance Opera\" ''[[Les Enfants terribles (opera)|Les Enfants terribles]]'' (1996), scored for voices, three pianos and dancers, with choreography by [[Susan Marshall (choreographer)|Susan Marshall]]. The characters are depicted by both singers and dancers. The scoring of the opera evokes Bach's [[harpsichord concertos (J. S.

The operatic Symphony No. 6 ''[[Plutonian Ode]]'' (2002) for soprano and orchestra was commissioned by the Brucknerhaus, Linz, and [[Carnegie Hall]] in celebration of Glass's sixty-fifth birthday, and developed from Glass's collaboration with [[Allen Ginsberg]] (poet, piano\u2014Ginsberg, Glass), based on his poem of the same name.\n\nBesides writing for the concert hall, Glass continued his ongoing operatic series with adaptions from literary texts: ''The Marriages of Zones 3, 4 and 5'' ([1997] story-libretto by Doris Lessing), ''[[In the Penal Colony (opera)|In the Penal Colony]]'' (2000, after the [[In the Penal Colony|story]] by [[Franz Kafka]]), and the chamber opera ''[[The Sound of a Voice (opera)|The Sound of a Voice]]'' (2003, with David Henry Hwang), which features the [[Pipa]], performed by [[Wu Man]] at its premiere.

In 2002, Glass and his producer Kurt Munkacsi and artist Don Christensen founded the Orange Mountain Music company, dedicated to \"establishing the recording legacy of Philip Glass\" and, to date, have released sixty albums of Glass's music.\n\n==Music for film==\nGlass has composed many film scores, starting with the orchestral score for ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' (1982), and continuing with two biopics, ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]'' (1985, resulting in the String Quartet No. 3) and ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997) about the [[Dalai Lama]], for which he received his first [[Academy Award]] nomination. In 1968 he composed and conducted the score for director Harrison Engle's minimalist comedy short, ''Railroaded,'' played by the Philip Glass Ensemble. This was one of his earliest film efforts.\n\nThe year after scoring ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987), Glass began a long collaboration with the filmmaker [[Errol Morris]] with his music for Morris's celebrated documentaries, including ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' (1988) and ''[[A Brief History of Time (film)|A Brief History of Time]]'' (1991).<ref>Butler, Isaac (March 16, 2018).[https://slate.com/culture/2018/03/errol-morris-on-stephen-hawking-and-his-movie-a-brief-history-of-time.html \"Errol Morris on His Movie\u2014and Long Friendship\u2014With Stephen Hawking,\"] ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', retrieved July 30, 2018.</ref>  He continued composing for the [[Qatsi trilogy]] with the scores for ''[[Powaqqatsi]]'' (1988) and ''[[Naqoyqatsi]]'' (2002). In 1995, he composed the theme for [[Godfrey Reggio|Reggio]]'s short independent film ''[[Evidence (1995 film)|Evidence]]''. He made a cameo appearance\u2014briefly visible performing at the piano\u2014in [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998), which uses music from ''Powaqqatsi'', ''Anima Mundi'' and ''Mishima'', as well as three original tracks by Glass. In the 1990s, he also composed scores for ''[[Bent (1997 film)|Bent]]'' (1997) and the supernatural horror film ''[[Candyman (1992 film)|Candyman]]'' (1992) and its sequel, ''[[Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh]]'' (1995), plus a film adaptation of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[The Secret Agent (1996 film)|The Secret Agent]]'' (1996).\n\nIn 1999, he finished a new soundtrack for the 1931 film ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]''. ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'' (2002) earned him a second Academy Award nomination. The circular, recurring nature of Glass' music has been praised for providing stability and contrast to frequent jumps across time and geography in the film's narrative. In this way, the soundtrack has a distinctive personality, so much so that director Stephen Daldry believes Glass's music serves as \"another stream of consciousness, another character\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Deborah Crisp|last2=Roger Hillman|date=2010|title=Chiming the Hours: A Philip Glass Soundtrack|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5406/musimoviimag.3.2.0030|journal=Music and the Moving Image|volume=3|issue=2|pages=30|doi=10.5406/musimoviimag.3.2.0030|issn=2167-8464}}</ref> in the film. ''The Hours'' was followed by another Morris documentary, ''[[The Fog of War]]'' (2003).

Glass's most recent film scores include ''[[No Reservations (film)|No Reservations]]'' (Glass makes a brief cameo in the film sitting at an outdoor caf\u00e9), ''[[Cassandra's Dream]]'' (2007), ''Les Regrets'' (2009), ''Mr Nice'' (2010), the Brazilian film ''Nosso Lar'' (2010) and ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2015, in collaboration with [[Marco Beltrami]]). In 2009, Glass composed original theme music for ''[[Transcendent Man]]'', about the life and ideas of [[Ray Kurzweil]] by filmmaker [[Barry Ptolemy]].\n\nIn the 2000s, Glass's work from the 1980s again became known to wider public through various media.
