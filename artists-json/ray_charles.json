Her father could not keep her. Bailey, a man her father worked with, took her in. The Robinson family\u2014Bailey, his wife Mary Jane, and his mother\u2014 informally adopted her and Aretha took the surname Robinson. A few years later 15-year-old Aretha became pregnant by Bailey. During the ensuing scandal, she left Greenville late in the summer of 1930 to be with family back in Albany. After the birth of the child, Ray Charles, she and the infant Charles returned to Greenville. Aretha and Bailey's wife, who had lost a son, then shared in Charles's upbringing. The father abandoned the family, left Greenville, and married another woman elsewhere. By his first birthday, Charles had a brother, George. Later, no one could remember who George's father was.<ref name=Autobio/>\n\nCharles was deeply devoted to his mother and later recalled, despite her poor health and adversity, her perseverance, self-sufficiency, and pride as guiding lights in his life.\n\nIn his early years, Charles showed an interest in mechanical objects and would often watch his neighbors working on their cars and farm machinery. His musical curiosity was sparked at Wylie Pitman's Red Wing Cafe, at the age of three, when Pitman played [[boogie woogie]] on an old [[upright piano]]; Pitman subsequently taught Charles how to play the piano. Charles and his mother were always welcome at the Red Wing Cafe and even lived there when they were in financial distress.<ref name=Autobio/> Pitman would also care for Ray's younger brother George, to take some of the burden off their mother.

The pilot made a few circles in the air before he was finally able to see through a small part of the windshield and land the plane.

The rise of [[psychedelic rock]] and harder forms of rock and R&B music had reduced Charles's radio appeal, as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits, since his earnings from owning his master tapes had taken away the motivation to write new material. Charles nonetheless continued to have an active recording career. Most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions: either adored or panned by fans and critics alike.<ref name=\"boheme\"/> His recordings during this period, especially 1972's ''[[A Message from the People]]'', moved toward the [[progressive soul]] sound popular at the time.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Swenson|editor-first=John|year=1999|title=The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=9780679768739|page=138}}</ref> ''A Message from the People'' included his unique gospel-influenced version of \"[[America the Beautiful]]\" and a number of protest songs about poverty and civil rights. Charles was often criticized for his version of \"America the Beautiful\" because it was very drastically changed from the song's original version. On July 14, 1973, [[Margie Hendrix]], the mother of Ray's son Charles Wayne Hendrix, died at 38 years old, which led to Ray caring for the child. The official cause of her death is unknown.\n\nIn 1974, Charles left ABC Records and recorded several albums on his own label, Crossover Records. A 1975 recording of Stevie Wonder's hit \"[[Living for the City]]\" later helped Charles win another Grammy. In 1977, he reunited with Ahmet Ertegun and re-signed to Atlantic Records, for which he recorded the album ''[[True to Life (Ray Charles album)|True to Life]]'', remaining with his old label until 1980. However, the label had now begun to focus on rock acts, and some of their prominent soul artists, such as [[Aretha Franklin]], were starting to be neglected. In November 1977 he appeared as the host of the NBC television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77e.phtml|title=Ray Charles|publisher=SnlTranscripts.jt.org|date=November 12, 1977 |access-date=September 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1979, his version of \"Georgia on My Mind\" was proclaimed the [[state song]] of Georgia, and an emotional Charles performed the song on the floor of the state legislature. In 1980 Charles performed in the musical film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''.<ref name=\"boheme\"/> Although he had notably supported the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in the 1960s, Charles was criticized for performing at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort in South Africa in 1981 during an international boycott protesting that country's [[apartheid]] policy. He later defended his choice of performing there, insisting that the audience of black and white fans would integrate while he was there.<ref name=\"boheme\"/>\n\n===1983\u20132004: Later years===\nIn 1983, Charles signed a contract with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. He recorded a string of country albums and had hit singles in duets with singers such as [[George Jones]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[Mickey Gilley]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] (\"Precious Thing\") and his longtime friend [[Willie Nelson]], with whom he recorded \"[[Seven Spanish Angels]]\".\n\nIn 1985, Charles participated in the musical recording and video \"[[We Are the World]]\", a charity single recorded by the supergroup United Support of Artists (USA) for Africa.[[File:Ray Charles FIJM 2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Charles at the 2003 [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], one of his last public performances]]\n\nBefore the release of his first album for Warner, ''Would You Believe'', Charles made a return to the R&B charts with a cover of the [[The Brothers Johnson|Brothers Johnson]]'s \"[[I'll Be Good to You]]\", a duet with his lifelong friend Quincy Jones and the singer [[Chaka Khan]], which hit number one on the R&B chart in 1990 and won Charles and Khan a Grammy for their duet. Prior to this, Charles returned to the pop charts with \"[[Baby Grand]]\", a duet with singer-songwriter [[Billy Joel]]. In 1989, he recorded a cover of the [[Southern All Stars]]' \"Itoshi no Ellie\" for a Japanese TV advertisement for the [[Suntory]] brand, releasing it in Japan as \"Ellie My Love\", where it reached No.{{nbsp}}3 on its [[Oricon]] chart.<ref name=\"oricon89\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.wbs.ne.jp/~ms-db/oricon/oricon_single_89.htm |title=List of Best-Selling International Singles in Japan of 1989 |publisher=Oricon.

In 2003, Charles performed \"Georgia on My Mind\" and \"America the Beautiful\" at a televised annual banquet of electronic media journalists held in Washington, D.C.

In the words of musicologist [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]]:\n\n{{blockquote|Sinatra, and Bing Crosby before him, had been masters of words. Ray Charles is a master of sounds. His records disclose an extraordinary assortment of slurs, glides, turns, shrieks, wails, breaks, shouts, screams and hollers, all wonderfully controlled, disciplined by inspired musicianship, and harnessed to ingenious subtleties of harmony, dynamics and rhythm... It is either the singing of a man whose vocabulary is inadequate to express what is in his heart and mind or of one whose feelings are too intense for satisfactory verbal or conventionally melodic articulation. He can't tell it to you. He can't even sing it to you. He has to cry out to you, or shout to you, in tones eloquent of despair\u2014or exaltation. The voice alone, with little assistance from the text or the notated music, conveys the message.<ref>{{cite book|first= Henry|last= Pleasants|author-link= Henry Pleasants (music critic)|date= 1974|title= The Great American Popular Singers|publisher= Simon and Schuster|location= New York City|isbn= 9780671216818|url= https://archive.org/details/greatamericanpop00pleas}}</ref>}}\n\nPleasants continues, \"Ray Charles is usually described as a baritone, and his speaking voice would suggest as much, as would the difficulty he experiences in reaching and sustaining the baritone's high E and F in a popular ballad. But the voice undergoes some sort of transfiguration under stress, and in music of gospel or blues character he can and does sing for measures on end in the high tenor range of A, B flat, B, C and even C sharp and D, sometimes in full voice, sometimes in an ecstatic head voice, sometimes in falsetto. In falsetto he continues up to E and F above high C. On one extraordinary record, 'I'm Going Down to the River'...he hits an incredible B flat...giving him an overall range, including the falsetto extension, of at least three octaves.\"\n\nHis style and success in the genres of rhythm and blues and jazz had an influence on a number of highly successful artists, including, as Jon Pareles has noted, [[Elvis Presley]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Van Morrison]], and [[Billy Joel]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/10/arts/music/ray-charles-who-reshaped-american-music-dies-at-73.html |title= Ray Charles, Who Reshaped American Music, Dies at 73|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 10, 2004 |access-date=September 23, 2018}}</ref> Other singers who have acknowledged Charles's influence on their own styles include [[James Booker]],<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book| first= Tony| last= Russell| date= 1997| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray| publisher=Carlton Books | location= Dubai| page= 94| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> [[Steve Winwood]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Buckley |first=Michael |url=https://www.stevewinwood.com/news/6062 |title= A Chat With Steve Winwood: June 10, 2005 |publisher=The Annapolis Capital |access-date=September 23, 2018}}</ref> [[Richard Manuel]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Viney |first=Peter |url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/viney_ray_charles_band.html|title= Influences on The Band: Ray Charles|publisher=theband.hiof.no |access-date=September 23, 2018}}</ref> and [[Gregg Allman]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lynskey|first=John|url=https://www.greggallman.com/music/back-to-macon/|title= Gregg Allman Live: Back to Macon|date=December 5, 2016|publisher=greggallman.com |access-date=September 23, 2018 }}</ref> According to Joe Levy, a music editor for ''Rolling Stone'', \"The hit records he made for Atlantic in the mid-1950s mapped out everything that would happen to rock 'n' roll and soul music in the years that followed\".<ref name=\"times\" /> Charles was also an inspiration to [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]], who told the Turkish newspaper ''[[Hurriyet]]'': \"I was about 15.

[[AllMusic]] has listed approximately 60 original albums and more than 200 compilation albums, while music essayist [[Robert Christgau]] noted the existence of more. At least 20 record labels have released near-identical compilations of Charles' pre-[[Atlantic Records]] tracks, while many of the [[mastering (audio)|masters]] that Charles began to own after 1960 were not digitally reissued, leading the Atlantic sister label [[Rhino Entertainment]] to focus on rereleasing his mid-to-late 1950s music. Christgau has called Charles' discography a \"monumental mess\" and that \"any map of his oeuvre must be personal and provisional\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=July 8, 2004|title=The Genius at Work: Ray Charles, A Critical Discography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=July 24, 2021|via=robertchristgau.com|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/charles-rs.php}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n| 1961\n| ''[[Swingin' Along]]''\n| Himself\n| \n|-\n| 1965\n| ''[[Ballad in Blue]]''\n| Himself\n|\n|-\n| 1966\n| ''[[The Big T.N.T.
