A leading figure in the music industry, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on [[popular music]].\n\nBowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"[[Space Oddity]]\", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the [[glam rock]] era with his flamboyant and androgynous [[alter ego]] [[Ziggy Stardust (character)|Ziggy Stardust]]. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" and album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as \"[[plastic soul]]\", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\" and the album ''[[Young Americans]]''. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' and released ''[[Station to Station]]''. In 1977, he again changed direction with the [[electronic music|electronic]]-inflected album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', the first of three collaborations with [[Brian Eno]] that came to be known as the \"[[Berlin Trilogy]]\". ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", its album ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'', and \"[[Under Pressure]]\" (a 1981 collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]). He achieved massive commercial success in the 1980s starting with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the [[hard rock]] band [[Tin Machine]] before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[Jungle music|jungle]]. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), [[Jareth]] the Goblin King in ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), [[Pontius Pilate]] in ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), and [[Nikola Tesla]] in ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with ''[[The Next Day]]''. He remained musically active until his [[Death of David Bowie|death from liver cancer]] at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'' (2016).\n\nDuring his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling musicians of all time]]. In the UK, he was awarded ten [[BPI certification|platinum]], eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|11 number-one albums]]. In the US, he received five [[RIAA certification|platinum]] and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him among [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|the greatest artists in history]]. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Robert Jones was born on 8 January 1947 in [[Brixton]], London.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.biography.com/musician/david-bowie |title = David Bowie |publisher = [[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (American TV channel)|FYI]]/[[A&E Networks]]) |access-date = 20 June 2022 }}</ref> His mother, Margaret Mary \"Peggy\" (n\u00e9e Burns; 2 October 1913 \u2013 2 April 2001),<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news |title=Bowie mourns mother's death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1256864.stm |url-status=live |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2 April 2001 |access-date=9 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111215005/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1256864.stm |archive-date=11 January 2016}}</ref> was born at [[Shorncliffe Army Camp]] near [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]], Kent.{{sfn|Gillman|Gillman|1987|p=17: \"[Peggy] was born in the hospital at Shorncliffe Camp [near Folkestone, Kent] on October 2nd, 1913.\"}} Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in [[Manchester]].{{sfn|Gillman|Gillman|1987|p=15: \"[Her father] Jimmy Burns's parents were poor Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester\"; p. 16: \"[Jimmy] had known [her mother] in Manchester.

The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and [[Stockwell]] in the south London borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]]. Bowie attended [[Stockwell Primary School|Stockwell Infants School]] until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child\u2014and a defiant brawler.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=9\u201316}}\n\nFrom 1953 Bowie moved with his family to [[Bickley]] and then [[Bromley Common]], before settling in [[Sundridge Park]] in 1955 where he attended Burnt Ash Junior School.<ref>{{cite web |last=Palmer |first=Jim |title=18 south east London places where David Bowie lived, learned and played |url=https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/14195175.map-18-south-east-london-places-where-david-bowie-lived-learned-and-played/ |url-status=live |website=News Shopper |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=31 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210806093810/https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/14195175.map-18-south-east-london-places-where-david-bowie-lived-learned-and-played/ |archive-date=6 August 2021}}</ref> His voice was considered \"adequate\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \"vividly artistic\" and his poise \"astonishing\" for a child.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=18\u201319}} The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American [[Gramophone record|45s]] by artists including [[the Teenagers]], [[the Platters]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Elvis Presley]] (who shared Bowie's birthday), and [[Little Richard]].{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=21}}{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=19\u201320}} Upon listening to Little Richard's song \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\", Bowie would later say that he had \"heard God\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Doggett|first=Peter|title=Teenage Wildlife|journal=Mojo Classic|issue=60 Years of Bowie|pages=8\u20139|date=January 2007}}</ref>\n\nBowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin Kristina dance to \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" soon after it was released in 1956.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=19\u201320}} According to Kristina, she and David \"danced like possessed elves\" to records of various artists.<ref name=\"Childhood dreams\">{{cite news |last=Marsh |first=Joanne |title=David Bowie's cousin pens letter about their childhood: 'He exceeded all his father's dreams' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/david-bowie-76-1199483 |date=18 February 2016 |access-date=26 December 2020 |magazine=[[NME]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117052410/https://www.nme.com/news/music/david-bowie-76-1199483 |archive-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the [[ukulele]] and [[tea-chest bass]], begun to participate in [[skiffle]] sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and [[Chuck Berry]]\u2014complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists\u2014to his local [[Cub Scout|Wolf Cub]] group was described as \"mesmerizing&nbsp;... like someone from another planet\".{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=19\u201320}} Having encouraged his son to follow his dreams of being an entertainer since he was a toddler, in the late 1950s David's father took him to meet singers and other performers preparing for the [[Royal Variety Performance]], introducing him to [[Alma Cogan]] and [[Tommy Steele]].<ref name=\"Childhood dreams\"/> After taking his [[eleven-plus]] exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to [[Ravens Wood School|Bromley Technical High School]].{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=21\u201322}} It was an unusual technical school, as biographer [[Christopher Sandford (biographer)|Christopher Sandford]] wrote:\n\n{{blockquote|Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]. There were [[House system|houses]] named after eighteenth-century statesmen like [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]]. There was a uniform and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of [[Owen Frampton]]. In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, [[Peter Frampton|Peter]], to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=21\u201322}}}}\n\nBowie's maternal half-brother, Terry Burns, was a substantial influence on his early life.{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 4}} Burns, who was 10 years older than Bowie, had [[schizophrenia]] and [[seizures]], and lived alternately at home and in psychiatric wards; while living with Bowie, he introduced the younger man to many of his lifelong influences, such as [[modern jazz]], [[Buddhism]], [[Beat poetry]], and the [[occult]].{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 3\u20134}} In addition to Burns, a significant proportion of Bowie's extended family members had [[schizophrenia spectrum disorders]], including an aunt who was institutionalised and another who underwent a [[lobotomy]]; this has been labelled as an influence on his early work.{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 4}}\n\nBowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting. After Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like [[Charles Mingus]] and [[John Coltrane]] led his mother to give him a [[Grafton saxophone]] in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from [[baritone saxophone|baritone saxophonist]] [[Ronnie Ross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berklee.edu/commencement/past|title=Commencement 1999 \u2013 Berklee College of Music|website=www.berklee.edu|access-date=10 February 2018|archive-date=10 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180516/https://www.berklee.edu/commencement/past|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=25}} He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend [[George Underwood (artist)|George Underwood]] punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation,{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=57}} his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty [[depth perception]] and [[anisocoria]] (a permanently dilated pupil), which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour, erroneously suggesting he had [[heterochromia iridum]] (one iris a different colour to the other); his eye later became one of Bowie's most recognisable features.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tanya|last=Basu|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/01/story-behind-david-bowies-unusual-eyes.html|title=The Story Behind David Bowie's Unusual Eyes|work=[[The Cut (website)|The Cut]]|date=12 January 2016|access-date=21 January 2016|archive-date=17 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117143944/http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/story-behind-david-bowies-unusual-eyes.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=19}}\n\n==Music career==\n\n===1962\u20131967: Early career to debut album===\n[[File:David Bowie (1967).png|thumb|upright|alt=Bowie looking to the camera|A trade ad photo of Bowie in 1967]]\nBowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based [[rock and roll]] at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=28}} When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur [[John Bloom (businessman)|John Bloom]] inviting him to \"do for us what [[Brian Epstein]] has done for [[the Beatles]]\u2014and make another million.\" Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to [[Dick James]]'s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nConn quickly began to promote Bowie. His debut single, \"[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]\", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chaps. 1\u20132}} Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Willie Dixon]] covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul\u2014\"I used to dream of being their [[Mick Jagger]]\", Bowie was to recall.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=29\u201330}} Their cover of [[Bobby Bland]]'s \"[[I Pity the Fool]]\" was no more successful than \"Liza Jane\", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by [[the Who]]. \"[[You've Got a Habit of Leaving]]\" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world \"to study mime at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]\", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, helped secure him a contract with [[Pye Records]]. Publicist [[Tony Hatch]] signed Bowie on the basis that he wrote his own songs.{{sfn|Trynka|2011|pp=65\u201366}} Dissatisfied with Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] of [[the Monkees]], he took on the stage name David Bowie after the 19th-century American pioneer [[James Bowie]] and [[Bowie knife|the knife he had popularised]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=64\u201367}}{{sfn|Trynka|2011|pp=54\u201359}}{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=33}} His first release under the name was the January 1966 single \"[[Can't Help Thinking About Me]]\", recorded with the Lower Third.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=55\u201357}} The single flopped like its predecessors.{{sfn|Trynka|2011|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nAfter the single's release, Bowie departed the Lower Third, partly due to Horton's influence,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=55\u201357}} and released two more singles for Pye, \"[[Do Anything You Say]]\" and \"[[I Dig Everything]]\", both of which featured a new band called the Buzz, before signing with [[Deram Records]].{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chaps. 1\u20132}} Around this time Bowie also joined [[the Riot Squad]]; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by [[the Velvet Underground]], went unreleased. [[Kenneth Pitt]], introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=35\u201339}} His April 1967 solo single, \"[[The Laughing Gnome]]\", on which speeded-up and thus high-pitched vocals were used to portray the gnome in the song, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'', an amalgam of pop, [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelia]] and [[music hall]], met the same fate. It was his last release for two years.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=41\u201342}} In September, Bowie recorded \"[[Let Me Sleep Beside You]]\" and \"[[Karma Man]]\", which were rejected by Deram for release as a single and left unreleased until 1970. Both tracks marked the beginning of Bowie's working relationship with producer [[Tony Visconti]] which, with large gaps, would last for the rest of Bowie's career.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=146, 157}}{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 2}}\n\n=== 1968\u20131971: ''Space Oddity'' to ''Hunky Dory'' ===\n{{anchor|Hermione Farthingale}}\nStudying the dramatic arts under [[Lindsay Kemp]], from [[avant-garde]] theatre and [[mime]] to [[commedia dell'arte]], Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, the Bowie composition \"Over The Wall We Go\" became a 1967 single for [[Paul Nicholas|Oscar]]; another Bowie song, \"[[Silly Boy Blue]]\", was released by [[Billy Fury]] the following year.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=46}} Playing acoustic guitar, Hermione Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, [[Beat music|Merseybeat]], poetry, and mime.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=49\u201352}}\n\nAfter the break-up with Farthingale, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=53}} In February and March 1969, he undertook a short tour with [[Marc Bolan]]'s duo [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]], as third on the bill, performing a mime act.{{sfn|Paytress|2009|p=199}} On 11 July 1969, \"[[Space Oddity]]\" was released five days ahead of the [[Apollo 11]] launch, and reached the top five in the UK.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=49\u201350}} Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in [[Beckenham]] High Street.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=53}} The club was influenced by the [[Arts Lab]] movement, developing into the [[Beckenham Arts Lab]] and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, the subject of his song \"[[Memory of a Free Festival]]\".{{sfn|McKay|1996|p=188}}\n\nBowie's second album followed in November; originally issued in the UK as ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'', it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the early US release was instead titled ''Man of Words/Man of Music''; it was reissued internationally in 1972 by [[RCA Records]] as ''Space Oddity''. Featuring philosophical post-[[hippie]] lyrics on peace, love, and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=60}}\n\nBowie met [[Angie Bowie|Angela Barnett]] in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving manager [[Ken Pitt]] with limited influence which he found frustrating.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=54\u201360}} Having established himself as a solo artist with \"Space Oddity\", Bowie began to sense a lacking: \"a full-time band for gigs and recording\u2014people he could relate to personally\".{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=62\u201363}} The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with Marc Bolan, who was at the time acting as his session guitarist.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=62\u201363}} The band Bowie assembled comprised John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, Tony Visconti on bass and [[Mick Ronson]] on electric guitar. Known as [[Hype (David Bowie band)|Hype]], the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders from Mars.

His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and roll singers like [[Little Richard]] and [[Elvis Presley]], and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor [[Anthony Newley]], whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, ''David Bowie'' (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher).{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=4}} Bowie's fascination with [[music hall]] continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.{{sfn|Perone|2007|pp=22, 36\u201337}}\n\nMusicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, \"Space Oddity\", and later in the song \"{{-'}}Heroes{{'-}}\" to dramatic effect; Perone notes that \"in the lowest part of his vocal register&nbsp;... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.\"{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=12}}\n\nVoice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as \"particularly deliberate and distinctive\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Find Your Voice: A Self-Help Manual for Singers|first=Jo|last=Thompson|publisher=Artemis Editions|location=Chamali\u00e8res, France|year=2004|isbn=978-0-634-07435-6|page=76}}</ref> Schinder and Schwartz call him \"a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect.\"{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=483}} Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, Bowie's roleplaying is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics \"arrest our ear, without question.
