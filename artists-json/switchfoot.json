The band's members are [[Jon Foreman]] ([[lead vocals]], [[guitar]]), Tim Foreman ([[bass guitar]], [[backing vocals]]), Chad Butler ([[drum kit|drums]], [[percussion]]), and [[Jerome Fontamillas]] (guitar, [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], backing vocals). After early successes in the [[Christian rock]] scene, Switchfoot first gained mainstream recognition with the inclusion of four of their songs in the 2002 movie ''[[A Walk to Remember]]''. This recognition led to their major label debut, ''[[The Beautiful Letdown]]'', which was released in 2003 and featured the hits \"[[Meant to Live]]\" and \"[[Dare You to Move]]\". The album sold over 2.6 million copies.

After playing a few shows including the Foreman brothers' dad's megachurch [[North Coast Calvary Chapel]] in [[Carlsbad, California]], the band was contacted by music industry veteran [[Charlie Peacock]] and eventually signed to his indie label [[Rethink (record label)|Re:think Records]] under the current moniker, Switchfoot. Re:think went on to distribute the first three Switchfoot albums, ''[[The Legend of Chin]]'', ''[[New Way to Be Human]]'', and ''[[Learning to Breathe (Switchfoot album)|Learning to Breathe]]''. Because Re:think was bought by Christian giant [[Sparrow Records]] before Switchfoot's first release, however, the band's and Peacock's intentions of being marketed outside of the [[Contemporary Christian music]] scene and reaching a wider audience were put on hold. Consequently, the band was mostly marketed to Christian radio and retail outlets early in their careers, a time Jon Foreman has described as when \"half of who we were was lost.\"<ref name=\"christianitytoday03\">\n {{cite magazine\n |url         = http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2003/jonforeman-0103.html\n |title       = Switchfoot Focuses on Life's Beauty over Letdowns\n |date        = January 1, 2003\n |access-date  = July 22, 2009\n |magazine   = Christianity Today\n |last        = Argyrakis\n |first       = Andy\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090811180638/http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2003/jonforeman-0103.html\n |archive-date = August 11, 2009\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOf Switchfoot's first three albums, ''[[Learning to Breathe (Switchfoot album)|Learning to Breathe]]'' was the most successful, receiving a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album|Best Rock Gospel Album]].\n\nLater on in 2002, Switchfoot's music was featured prominently in the movie ''[[A Walk to Remember (film)|A Walk to Remember]]'', starring singer and actress [[Mandy Moore]], who sang Switchfoot's song \"[[Only Hope]]\" during a scene in the movie.

[But] when Sparrow [a Christian label] bought re:think Records, it was evident that our music wasn't going to be in the hands of everybody. As a Christian, I have a lot to say within the walls of the church. But also, as a Christian, I've got a lot to say just about life in general ...

The Bro Am festivities typically include a silent auction the night before the public event, wherein donors bid in a silent auction for charity. The Bro Am event consists of surf contests in the morning and musical performances in the afternoon, culminating in Switchfoot's capstone performance. Since its inception, the Bro Am has raised over $1 million for charitable causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.axs.com/switchfoot-announces-eleventh-annual-bro-am-date-and-tour-dates-57517|title=Switchfoot announces eleventh annual Bro-Am date and tour dates|author=Jamie Malan|work=AXS|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624141402/http://www.axs.com/switchfoot-announces-eleventh-annual-bro-am-date-and-tour-dates-57517|archive-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Switchfoot joined forces with the fellow rock band Lifehouse, to help raise funds for Hurricane Harvey victims through their song \"Shine Like Gold\u201d.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/music/lifehouse-switchfoot-single-shine-like-gold-raises-funds-hurricane-harvey-relief/|title=Lifehouse and Switchfoot Dropping New Single to Raise Funds for Hurricane Harvey Relief: 'We Love Houston'|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=April 2, 2018|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209084703/http://people.com/music/lifehouse-switchfoot-single-shine-like-gold-raises-funds-hurricane-harvey-relief/|archive-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n;Current members\n*[[Jon Foreman]] \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, piano <small>(1996\u2013present)</small>; lead guitar <small>(1996\u20132004)</small>; rhythm guitar <small>(1996\u20132001, 2005\u20132022)</small>\n*Tim Foreman \u2013 bass, backing vocals, acoustic guitar <small>(1996\u2013present)</small>\n*Chad Butler \u2013 drums, percussion <small>(1996\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Jerome Fontamillas]] \u2013 keyboards, piano, synthesizers, rhythm guitar, backing vocals <small>(2001\u2013present)</small>\n\n;Current touring musicians\n*Boaz Roberts \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals <small>(2021\u2013present)</small>\n\n;Former members\n*[[Drew Shirley]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals <small>(2005\u20132022; touring musician 2004\u20132005)</small>\n\n; Timeline\n<timeline>\nImageSize      = width:900 height:auto barincrement:36\nPlotArea       = left:100 bottom:110 top:0 right:10\nAlignbars      = justify\nDateFormat     = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod         = from:01/01/1996 till:04/19/2022\nTimeAxis       = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend         = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\nScaleMinor     = increment:1 start:1996\nScaleMajor     = increment:3 start:1997\n\nColors =\n  id:LVocals  value:red      legend:Lead_vocals\n  id:BVocals  value:pink     legend:Backing_vocals\n  id:LGuitar  value:teal     legend:Lead_guitar\n  id:RGuitar  value:green    legend:Rhythm_guitar\n  id:Bass     value:blue     legend:Bass,_acoustic_guitar\n  id:Drums    value:orange   legend:Drums,_percussion\n  id:Keyboard value:purple   legend:Keyboards,_piano,_synths\n  id:album    value:black    legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n layer:back\n color:album\n  at:06/17/1997\n  at:03/11/1999\n  at:09/26/2000\n  at:02/25/2003\n  at:09/13/2005\n  at:12/26/2006\n  at:11/10/2009\n  at:09/27/2011\n  at:01/14/2014\n  at:07/08/2016\n  at:01/18/2019\n  at:08/20/2021\n\nBarData =\n bar:JForeman  text:\"Jon Foreman\"\n bar:Shirley   text:\"Drew Shirley\"\n bar:Fonte     text:\"Jerome Fontamillas\"\n bar:TForeman  text:\"Tim Foreman\"\n bar:Butler    text:\"Chad Butler\"\n\nPlotData =\n width:21\n  bar:Jforeman  from:01/01/1996 till:end        color:LVocals\n  bar:Jforeman  from:01/01/1996 till:end        color:Keyboard width:3\n  bar:Jforeman  from:01/01/1996 till:05/01/2005 color:LGuitar width:11\n  bar:Jforeman  from:01/01/1996 till:10/01/2001 color:RGuitar width:15\n  bar:Jforeman  from:05/01/2005 till:02/21/2022 color:RGuitar width:11\n  bar:Jforeman  from:02/21/2022 till:end        color:LGuitar width:11\n  bar:Shirley   from:05/01/2005 till:02/21/2022 color:LGuitar\n  bar:Shirley   from:05/01/2005 till:02/21/2022 color:BVocals width:3\n  bar:Fonte     from:10/01/2001 till:end        color:Keyboard\n  bar:Fonte     from:10/01/2001 till:end        color:RGuitar width:11\n  bar:Fonte     from:10/01/2001 till:end        color:BVocals width:3\n  bar:Tforeman  from:01/01/1996 till:end        color:Bass\n  bar:Tforeman  from:01/01/1996 till:end        color:BVocals width:3\n  bar:Butler    from:01/01/1996 till:end        color:Drums\n</timeline>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Switchfoot discography}}\n* ''[[The Legend of Chin]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[New Way to Be Human]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Learning to Breathe (Switchfoot album)|Learning to Breathe]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[The Beautiful Letdown]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Nothing Is Sound]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Oh!
