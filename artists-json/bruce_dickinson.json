Please only add notable occupations, i.e. things for which he is famous--> who has been the lead singer of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]] 1981\u20131993 and 1999\u2013present. He is known for his wide-ranging [[operatic]] vocal style and energetic stage presence.\n\nDickinson began his career in music fronting small pub bands in the 1970s while attending school in [[Sheffield]] and university in [[London]]. In 1979, he joined [[New wave of British heavy metal|British new wave heavy metal]] band [[Samson (band)|Samson]], with whom he gained some popularity under the stage name \"Bruce Bruce\" and performed on two studio records. He left Samson in 1981 to join Iron Maiden, replacing [[Paul Di'Anno]], and debuted on their 1982 album ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]''. During his first tenure in the band, they issued a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nDickinson quit Iron Maiden in 1993 (being replaced by [[Blaze Bayley]]) to pursue his solo career, which saw him experiment with a wide variety of heavy metal and rock styles. He re-joined the band in 1999, along with guitarist [[Adrian Smith]], and has released six subsequent studio albums with the band. Since his return to Iron Maiden, he issued one further solo record in 2005, ''[[Tyranny of Souls]]''. His younger cousin, [[Rob Dickinson]], is the former lead singer of British [[alternative rock]] band [[Catherine Wheel (band)|Catherine Wheel]], while his son, Austin, fronted the [[metalcore]] band [[Rise to Remain]].\n\nOutside his career in music, Dickinson has pursued a number of other activities. He undertook a career as a commercial pilot for [[Astraeus Airlines]], which led to a number of media-reported ventures such as captaining Iron Maiden's converted charter aeroplane, [[Iron Maiden#Ed Force One|Ed Force One]], during their world tours. Following Astraeus' closure, he created his own aircraft maintenance and pilot training company, Cardiff Aviation, in 2012. Dickinson presented his own radio show on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] from 2002 to 2010, and has also hosted television documentaries, authored novels and film scripts, created a beer with [[Robinsons Brewery]] and competed at fencing internationally.\n\n==Early life==\nPaul Bruce Dickinson was born on 7 August 1958 in [[Worksop, Nottinghamshire]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=198}} His mother, Sonia, worked part-time in a shoe shop, and his father, Bruce, was a mechanic in the [[British Army]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=198|2a1=Shooman|2y=2007|2p=11}} His birth hurried the young couple, who were then just teenagers, into marriage.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=198}} Initially, he was brought up by his grandparents; his grandfather was a coal-face worker at the local [[colliery]], and his grandmother was a housewife.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=198}} This is referred to in his song \"Born In '58\" from the album ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]''.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=119}} Dickinson started school at Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to [[Sheffield]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=198}} Soon afterwards, when he was six, he was also despatched to Sheffield,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=200}} where he attended a primary school in [[Manor, South Yorkshire|Manor Top]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=201}} After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=201}} Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as he was unable to make close friends.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=202}} Dickinson has a younger sister, professional [[showjumper]] Helena Stormanns, who was born in 1963.{{Sfnm|1a1=Shooman|1y=2007|1p=12|2a1=D'Souza|2y=2005}} He tried to isolate himself from her as much as he could when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=203}}\n\nDickinson's first musical experience was dancing in his grandparents' front room to [[Chubby Checker]]'s \"[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]\", when he still lived with them in Worksop.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=199}} The first record Dickinson recalls owning was [[The Beatles]] single \"[[She Loves You]]\", which he managed to persuade his grandfather to buy him, which made him more interested in music.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=199}} He tried to play an acoustic guitar belonging to his father, but it blistered his fingers.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=201}} By the time he moved to Sheffield, Dickinson's parents were earning a good living from buying property, refurbishing it and then selling it for a profit.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=12}} As a result, much of Dickinson's childhood was spent living on a building site, until his parents bought a boarding house and a bankrupt garage where his father began selling second-hand cars.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=201}} The income from their business success gave them the opportunity to give Dickinson\u2014then 13 years old\u2014a boarding school education and they chose [[Oundle School|Oundle]], a [[public school (UK)|public school]] in Northamptonshire.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=201}} Dickinson was not opposed to moving away from home because he had not built \"any real attachment\" to his parents, having been raised by his grandparents in Worksop until he was six.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=201}}\n\nAt Oundle, Dickinson was picked on and routinely bullied by the older boys of Sidney House, the boarding house that he belonged to,{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=13}} which he described as \"like systematic torture\" and meant that he became an outsider.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=203}} His interests at Oundle were often military; he co-founded the school wargames society with Mike Jordan, and he joined the school's cadet force.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=13}} This gave him access to live ammunition, which he used to create explosions as booby-traps.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=204}} Oundle was where Dickinson became attracted to progressive rock and early heavy metal after hearing [[Deep Purple]]'s \"[[Child in Time]]\" being played in another student's room.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=204}} As a result, the first album he ever bought was [[Deep Purple in Rock|Deep Purple's ''In Rock'']], which created his interest in rock and metal music.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=205}} After ''In Rock'', he went on to buy [[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Black Sabbath (album)|debut]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]'s ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' and ''[[Tarkus]]'' by [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=205}} Every term, a band would play at the school, the first of these which Dickinson saw was called Wild Turkey, featuring former Jethro Tull bassist [[Glenn Cornick]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=205}} After that, he saw [[Van der Graaf Generator]] and [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=205}}\n\nDickinson initially wanted to play the drums,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=205}} later obtaining a pair of [[bongo drum]]s from the music room for practice.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=206}} He remembers playing \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\" with his friend Mike Jordan, during which Dickinson discovered his singing voice while encouraging Jordan to sing the high-notes.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=206}} Shortly afterwards Dickinson was expelled from Oundle for participating in a prank in which he allegedly urinated in the headmaster's dinner.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=206}} Returning home to Sheffield in 1976, Dickinson enrolled at [[King Edward VII School, Sheffield|King Edward VII School]], at which he joined his first band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=207}} He had overheard two other pupils talking about their band and that they needed a singer and so volunteered immediately.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=207}} They rehearsed in the garage of the drummer's father, and the band were impressed by Dickinson's singing, encouraging him to buy his first microphone.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=207}} Their first gig took place at the Broadfield Tavern in Sheffield.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=207}} Originally called \"Paradox\", the band changed their name on Dickinson's suggestion to \"Styx\", unaware of the [[Styx (band)|American act with the same name]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=208}} They made local newspaper headlines when a steel worker was awoken by their performance and tried to smash the band's drum kit.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=17}} Soon afterwards the band split up.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=208}}\n\nAfter leaving school with [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] in English, History, and Economics, Dickinson confessed, \"I didn't really know what I wanted to do.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=208}} The first thing he did was join the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] for six months.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=208}} Although he enjoyed his time in the TA, Dickinson realised that it was not a career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at [[Queen Mary University of London|Queen Mary College]], London.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=208}} His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his \"cover story\", and immediately began playing in bands.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=208}} At university, Dickinson got involved in the Entertainments Committee: \"one day you'd be a roadie for [[The Jam]], the next you'd be putting up the [[Stonehenge]] backdrop for [[Hawkwind]] or whatever.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=209}} In 1977, Dickinson met Paul \"Noddy\" White, a multi-instrumentalist who owned a PA and other equipment, with whom Dickinson, along with drummer Steve Jones, would form a band together called Speed.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=209}} According to Dickinson, the band was called Speed because of the way in which they played, rather than a reference to drug-taking.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=209}} In Speed, Dickinson began writing his own material after White taught him how to play three chords on the guitar.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=209}}\n\nAlthough Speed would play several gigs at the Green Man pub in [[Plumstead]], the band did not last long, but it encouraged Dickinson to continue to work towards being a musician.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=209}} Dickinson spotted an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' with the caption \"Singer wanted for recording project\" and replied immediately.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=209}} He recorded a demo tape and sent it with a note which read: \"By the way, if you think the singing's crap, there's some [[John Cleese]] stuff recorded on the other side you might find amusing.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=209}} They liked what they heard and invited Dickinson down to the studio to make \"Dracula\", the first song he would ever record, with a band called \"Shots\",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=209}} formed by two brothers, Phil and Doug Siviter.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=21}} The song would later appear on the second disc of ''[[The Best of Bruce Dickinson]]'' compilation. The brothers were impressed with Dickinson's vocal abilities and asked him to join their group.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=210}}\n\nDickinson played pubs with Shots on a regular basis to small audiences.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=210}} One particular night, Dickinson suddenly stopped in the middle of a song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=210}} He got such a good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=210}} The next step in Dickinson's career was taken in a pub called the Prince of Wales in Gravesend, Kent, where Shots were playing regularly, when [[Thunderstick|Barry Graham]] (\"Thunderstick\") and [[Paul Samson]] paid a visit.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=33}} Impressed with his stage-act, they talked with Dickinson afterwards and invited him to be their new singer.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=211}} Dickinson agreed to join their band, [[Samson (band)|Samson]], but only once he'd finished taking his History finals two weeks later.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=211}} Until that point, he had been neglecting his University education.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=211}} As a result, the university had tried to kick him out for failing his Second Year exams and not paying his accommodation fees, but he was saved because of his role as Entertainments Officer.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=211}} After writing 6 months' worth of essays in the space of two weeks and some last minute cramming for his exams, Dickinson achieved a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Lower second-class honours|2:2]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=211}}\n\n==Samson: 1979\u20131981==\n{{Main|Samson (band)}}\n{{quote box\n| width  = 30%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"In my na\u00efvety, I thought people who were in rock 'n' roll bands were great artists, and it was a huge shock to the system to realise that they weren't, that they didn't even aspire to be, really. Some of them did, maybe, but some of them, like Samson, were very frightened of the idea.\"\n| salign = right\n| source = \u2014Bruce Dickinson on his Samson band-mates.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=212}}\n}}\n\nAfter meeting Paul Samson and Barry Purkis at the Prince of Wales, and while still undertaking his final university exams, Dickinson joined Samson onstage at [[Bishop's Stortford]] to perform one of their songs, \"Rock Me Baby\", cementing his role as their new lead vocalist.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=35}}\n\nThe band had already released their debut album, ''[[Survivors (Samson album)|Survivors]]'', in 1979 on an [[independent music|independent label]], two months before Dickinson joined.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=211}} Immediately following the completion of his University work, he met up with the band at Greenwich's Wood Wharf studios to learn the ''Survivors'' album.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=36}} Although the tracks did not suit his vocal style,{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=40}} the band soon wrote the majority of the following ''[[Head On (Samson album)|Head On]]'' album in their earliest rehearsal sessions,{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=38}} some of which were immediately incorporated into their live set.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=40}}\n\nIt was during these early rehearsals that the nickname \"Bruce Bruce\" came about, derived from [[Monty Python]]'s \"[[Bruces sketch]]\".{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=38}} The name became very tiresome as the band's management continually wrote dud cheques, made payable to \"Bruce Bruce\", as a joke.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=213}} Dickinson later commented that he did not like it but considered it \"a sort of stage name\" and accepted it.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=213}}\n\nDickinson was dismayed to learn that not all rock performers were \"great artists\"; he felt that some, such as Samson, were only interested in women, drugs and alcohol, which he was unable to relate to.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=212}} Although he had smoked [[joint (cannabis)|joints]] before,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=212}} Dickinson discovered that it was impossible to communicate with other band members if he was sober, deciding that it was \"the price that had to be paid\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=213}}\n\nWhile fronting the band, Dickinson also came across [[Iron Maiden]] for the first time, who were supporting Samson at the Music Machine in 1980.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=214}} As Dickinson recalls; \"I was watching them, and they were good, really fucking good, and at that moment, I remember thinking, 'I wanna fucking sing for that band. In fact, I'm ''going'' to sing for that band! I ''know'' I'm going to sing for that band!' ... I just thought, 'This is really me. Not Samson.'\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=214}}\n\nDickinson remained in the band for another year, recording two studio albums with them\u2014''Head On'' and ''[[Shock Tactics]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=213}} However, Samson soon ran into difficulties with their record label, Gem, who went out of business and failed to finance their European tour in support of Iron Maiden.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=216}} The band were turned over to RCA, which began neglecting the group, and so they promptly fired their management team and the resulting injunction meant that their equipment was reclaimed and they could not be paid for their concert performances.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=216}} The band's last gig was at [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]], after which Dickinson was approached by Iron Maiden's manager, [[Rod Smallwood]], who asked him to audition to be their new lead vocalist.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=217}}\n\n==Iron Maiden==\n{{Main|Iron Maiden}}\n\n===Beginnings and success: 1981\u20131985===\n[[File:Bruce Dickinson 09.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Dickinson, left, performing on his first world tour with Iron Maiden in 1982]]\nDickinson went to audition for [[Iron Maiden]] at a rehearsal room in Hackney in September 1981 and immediately discovered that this was a much more professional operation than he was used to with Samson.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}} In the practice rooms, the band played through \"Prowler\", \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\", \"[[Running Free]]\" and \"Remember Tomorrow\", before asking Dickinson to sing the same songs again in a recording studio, and he was immediately inducted into the group.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}\n\nIron Maiden had a strict and organised routine that suited the band's writing style, which Dickinson described as a \"time table\".{{sfn|Book of Hours|1996}} After a few gigs, they began writing new material for their third album, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', released in 1982. In the wake of Samson's contractual problems, Dickinson could not legally be credited on any of the record's songs,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=224}} having to make, what he called, a \"moral contribution\", later revealing that he had contributed to \"The Prisoner\", \"Children of the Damned\" and \"[[Run to the Hills]]\".{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=82}} In the documentary ''[[12 Wasted Years]]'', manager Rod Smallwood refers to \"The Prisoner\" as being co-written by Dickinson and Adrian Smith. The album was a major success, topping the British charts,{{sfn|Official Charts Company}} and earning platinum status in the UK and the US.{{Sfnm|1a1=BPI|2a1=RIAA}} Following the release, the band embarked on a [[The Beast on the Road|supporting tour]] around the globe.\n{{quote box\n| width  = 30%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"I guess it was the first time I really thought about leaving.

Dickinson was disappointed with the effort as he felt that the band needed a more dramatic stylistic departure from past records to remain relevant, despite its introduction of [[synthesizer|synthesised]] bass and guitars.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}} He has no writing credits on the release, as his material, based on his own suggestion that the album should be more acoustic-focused, was rejected by the rest of the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}} Steve Harris, on the other hand, stated that his material was rejected because it was not good enough, and that Dickinson \"was probably more burnt out than anyone at the end of the last tour\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=261}}\n\nAfter a [[Somewhere on Tour|subsequent tour]], Iron Maiden started working on their next studio effort, ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', which featured more [[progressive rock]] elements than the band's previous records.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=264}} Although it became their second release to top the British charts,{{sfn|Official Charts Company}} it was also Dickinson's first album with the band that did not achieve platinum status in the US.{{sfn|RIAA}} Unlike ''Somewhere in Time'', Dickinson was much more enthusiastic about this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} After [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour|the following tour]] in 1988, the band decided to take a year off.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=273}}\n{{quote box\n| width  = 30%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"I thought it wouldn't be a problem to go out and do the shows at all ... but it wasn't a good vibe ... we walked out onstage and it was like a morgue.

Iron Maiden's eighth studio release, 1990's ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'', had a raw sound that, according to [[AllMusic]], did not \"hold up well\" compared to past efforts,{{sfn|Prato(3)}} as it was recorded in a barn which Steve Harris owned, with [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio|a mobile studio]] owned by the [[Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Berelian|2000}} The record featured Dickinson's \"[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter]]\", originally composed for [[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child|a film soundtrack]], which despite receiving a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song|worst original song]] [[10th Golden Raspberry Awards|in 1989]], became the band's first and only single to top the [[UK Singles Chart]].{{sfn|Official Charts Company}} By 1992, Harris had converted his barn into a proper studio, and the new album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', was recorded there,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=289}} resulting in a better overall sound than ''No Prayer for the Dying'',{{sfn|Prato(4)}} although Dickinson still claims it had limitations due to its size.{{sfn|Berelian|2000}}\n\nAfter the [[Fear of the Dark Tour]], Dickinson decided to leave Iron Maiden to concentrate on his solo career.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=293}} At that point the band had already booked [[Real Live Tour|a following tour]] in 1993, which Dickinson did not enjoy.

Dickinson took up the opportunity and called an old friend of his, former [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist, [[Janick Gers]], and, shortly after meeting up, they had \"[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter|Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter]]\" ready for the studio,{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=116}} then recorded with the assistance of bassist Andy Carr, and drummer Fabio del Rio.{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=117}} \"I wrote it in about three minutes\", states Dickinson, \"I don't know where the title 'Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter' came from, but it just popped into my head.
