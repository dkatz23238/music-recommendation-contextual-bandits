His music was described by critics as operatic, earning him the nicknames \"The [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] of Rock\" and \"The Big O.\" Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers chose to project machismo. He performed while standing motionless and wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark [[sunglasses]], which he wore to counter his shyness and [[stage fright]].\n\nBorn in Texas, Orbison began singing in a [[rockabilly]] and [[Country music|country-and-western]] band as a teenager. He was signed by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] in 1956, but enjoyed his greatest success with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of Orbison's singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40. He wrote or co-wrote almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" (1960), \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\" (1961), \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" (1961), \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (1963), and \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" (1964).\n\nAfter the mid-1960s, Orbison suffered a number of personal tragedies and his career faltered. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the [[Traveling Wilburys]] (a rock  [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]) with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at age 52. One month later, his song \"[[You Got It]]\" (1989) was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach the US & UK Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. He received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and five other Grammy Awards. ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on its list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936 in [[Vernon, Texas]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Orbison| first=Roy Jr. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/authorized-roy-orbison/oclc/1017566749|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|publisher=Center Street|others=Wesley Orbison, Alex Orbison, Jeff Slate|date=2017|isbn=9781478976547|edition=First|location=New York|pages=27|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> the middle son of nurse Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 \u2013 May 12, 1992) and Orbie Lee Orbison (1913\u20131984), an oil-well driller and car mechanic.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Nadine-Orbison/6000000012909498491 |title=Nadine Vesta Orbison |website=geni}}</ref> According to ''The Authorized Roy Orbison'', the family moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] in 1942 to find work in the aircraft factories.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last=Orbison|first=Alex|publisher=Center Street|others=Orbison, Wesley,, Orbison, Roy Jr., Slate, Jeff|year=2017|isbn=9781478976547|edition= Second|location=New York|pages=28|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School<ref name=\":0\" /> there until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon.\n\nOrbison's father gave him a guitar on his sixth birthday.

One of the first musicians that he heard in person was [[Ernest Tubb]], playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. In West Texas, he was exposed to [[rhythm and blues]], [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and Cajun music. The cajun favorite \"[[Jole Blon]]\" was one of the first songs that he sang in public.

Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing \"everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record\".<ref>Clayson, Alan p. 44.</ref> Orbison also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including \"[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go!

In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.<ref>Amburn, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A ballad Orbison wrote, \"The Clown\", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOrbison was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple [[Cadillac]]. Orbison wrote \"Claudette\"\u2014about Claudette Frady, whom he married in 1957\u2014and the [[Everly Brothers]] recorded it as the B-side of \"[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]\". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 56.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]], a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of [[Chet Atkins]], who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was \"Seems to Me\", by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then\u2014softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 62.</ref>\n\nPlaying shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together.<ref>Clayson, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs for [[RCA Victor]] at their [[RCA Studio B|Nashville studios]]; only two singles were judged worthy of release by the label.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\">Zak, p. 32.</ref> Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer [[Fred Foster]] at [[Monument Records]].\n\n== 1960\u20131964: Monument Records and stardom ==\n\n===Early singles===\nOrbison was one of the first recording artists to popularise the \"[[Nashville sound]]\", with a group of session musicians known as [[The Nashville A-Team]]. The Nashville sound was developed by producers [[Chet Atkins]], [[Owen Bradley]] (who worked closely with [[Patsy Cline]]), Sam Phillips, bassist [[Bob Moore]] and Fred Foster.<ref>Wolfe and Akenson, p. 24.</ref><ref>Hoffmann and Ferstler, p. 779.</ref> In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA Victor had refused, \"Paper Boy\", backed by \"With the Bug\", but neither charted.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\">Zak, p. 33.</ref>\n\nOrbison's own style, the sound created at  [[RCA Studio B|RCA Victor Studio B]] in Nashville with pioneer engineer [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a \"polished, professional sound... finally allowing Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\".<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\"/> Orbison requested a string section and with it, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \"Uptown\", written with Joe Melson.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\">Lehman, p. 48.</ref> Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/><ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' states that the music Orbison made in Nashville \"brought a new splendour to rock\", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=decurtis155>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 155.</ref>\n\n\"Uptown\" reached only number 72 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. His initial success came just as the '50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.<ref>Lehman, p. 19.</ref>\n\n===Top-10 hits===\n\n====1960\u20131962====\nExperimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from \"Uptown\", and another song they had written called \"Come Back to Me (My Love)\", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\">Zak, p. 35.</ref> It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, \"came not from his throat but deeper within\".<ref>Clayson, p. 77.</ref> The song was \"[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]\". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, but were turned down.<ref>Amburn p. 91.</ref> They instead recorded the song at RCA Victor's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\"/><ref name=Fremer>{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter-Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\"/>\n\n\"Only the Lonely\" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\"<ref name=\"rockhall\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard \"Only the Lonely\" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.<ref name=\"amburn98\">Amburn, p. 98.</ref> Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex \"Blue Angel\", which peaked at number nine in the US and number 11 in the UK. \"I'm Hurtin'\", with \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" as the B-side, rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Running Scared.ogg\n|title=\"Running Scared\" (1961)\n|description=The ending of \"Running Scared\" features Orbison's natural voice hitting high A natural.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and son Roy DeWayne, born in 1958.

Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasise his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.<ref name=decurtis155/> On that third take, \"Running Scared\" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, \"He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> Just weeks later \"Running Scared\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected \"Running Scared\": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n\"Crying\" followed in July 1961 and reached number two; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, \"[[Candy Man (Roy Orbison song)|Candy Man]]\", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as \"The Big O\", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with \"[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]\", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. Orbison enlisted The Webbs from Dothan, Alabama as his backing band. The band changed their names to The Candy Men (in reference to Roy's hit) and played with Orbison from 1962 to 1967.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Orbison|first1=Roy Jr|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/authorized-roy-orbison/oclc/1017566749|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last2=Orbison Alex|last3=Orbison|first3=Wesley|last4=Slate|first4=Jeff|publisher=Center Street|date=2017|isbn=9781478976547|location=New York|pages=137|language=English|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> They later went on to have their own career, releasing a few singles and two albums on their own.

Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by [[Willie Nelson]], \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).\n\nAs \"In Dreams\" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with the [[the Beatles|Beatles]]. When he arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, \"What's a Beatle, anyway?\" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, \"I am\".<ref>Amburn, p. 115.</ref> On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison simply played through 14 encores.<ref name=\"clayson109-113\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 109\u2013113.</ref> Finally, when the audience began chanting \"We want Roy!\" again, Lennon and [[Paul McCartney]] physically held Orbison back.<ref>Amburn, p. 117.</ref> [[Ringo Starr]] later said, \"In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything.\"<ref name=\"clayson109-113\"/> Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work.<ref>Lennon, John; McCartney, Paul; Harrison, George; Starr, Ringo (2002). ''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94</ref> Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was [[George Harrison]] with whom he would later form a strong friendship.\n\nIn 1963, touring took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette had an affair with the contractor who built their home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the autumn of 1963, she joined him.<ref>Amburn, pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately, he toured Australia and New Zealand with [[the Beach Boys]] and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.<ref>Amburn, p. 125.</ref> He travelled to Australia again, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]]. [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, \"a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.\"<ref name=\"amburn134\">Amburn, p. 134.</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Oh, Pretty Woman.ogg\n|title=\"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964)\n|description=The opening guitar riff of \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was a direct influence on \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" by the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]].<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 128 and Lehman, p. 169.</ref>\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote \"[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]\", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, \"A pretty woman never needs any money\".<ref>Amburn, p. 127.</ref> Just 40 minutes later, \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the autumn of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending a total of 18 weeks on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, \"In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\">Amburn, p. 128.</ref>\n\n==1965\u20131969: Career decline and tragedies==\n[[File:Roy Orbison 1967.png|thumb|Orbison in 1967]]\nClaudette and Orbison divorced in November 1964 over her infidelities, but reconciled 10 months later. His contract with Monument was expiring in June 1965. Wesley Rose, at this time acting as Orbison's agent, moved him from Monument Records to [[MGM Records]] (though in Europe he remained with [[Decca Records|Decca's]] [[London Records]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/hlu9986 |title=Roy Orbison - Ride Away / Wondering - London - UK - HLU 9986 |website=45cat |access-date=August 29, 2015}}</ref>) for $1&nbsp;million and with the understanding that he would expand into television and films, as Elvis Presley had done. Orbison was a film enthusiast, and when not touring, writing, or recording, he dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nRose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Victor's A-Team in Nashville.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\"/> Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled ''There Is Only One Roy Orbison'', sold fewer than 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> With the onset of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964\u201365, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation were driven from the charts.<ref>Lehman, p. 14</ref>\n\nWhile on tour again in the UK in 1966,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=131}} Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette travelled to Britain  to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}\n\nOrbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.<ref>Amburn, p. 126.</ref>\n\nOrbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but Roy claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles.<ref>Amburn, p. 54.</ref> On June 6, 1966, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]], she struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]], and died instantly.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 139.</ref>\n\nA grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.<ref>Lehman, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> Orbison's character was a spy who stole and had to protect and deliver a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]] and was supplied with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, \"I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time,\" with, according to biographer Colin Escott, \"zero conviction\".<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box office failure.

During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: \"[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to, so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 152.</ref>\n\nDuring a tour of Britain and playing [[Birmingham]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 161\u201363.</ref> Fire officials stated that the cause of the fire may have been an [[aerosol]] can, which possibly contained [[lacquer]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hendersonville, TN Home Fire Roy Orbison's House, Sep 1968 {{!}} GenDisasters ...

He went an entire decade by 1976 without an album reaching the charts. He also failed to produce any popular singles, except for a few in Australia. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents, and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records.<ref>Amburn, p. 170.</ref> Peter Lehman observed that Orbison's absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released popular covers of his songs. Orbison's version of \"[[Love Hurts]]\" was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by hard rock band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]]' version of \"Only the Lonely\" reached number one on the country music charts.<ref>Amburn, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of \"Dream Baby\".\n\nA compilation of Orbison's greatest hits reached number one in the UK in January 1976, and Orbison began to open concerts for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] that year, who started as [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s backup band. Ronstadt herself covered \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" in 1977, her version reaching number three on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.<ref>Amburn, p. 178.</ref> He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded ''[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]'' with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.\n\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbison with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis for a televised 1977 Christmas special]]\n\nIn late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to spend the winter in [[Hawaii]]. He checked in to a hospital there where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed [[coronary arteries]]. He underwent a triple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass]] on January 18, 1978.

The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll.{{according to whom|date=July 2021}} Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\"<ref name=\"amburn97\">Amburn, p. 97.</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 5, 2017}}</ref> and \"the Big O\".<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/>\n\nRoys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison's sons to administer their father's catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018, release of ''Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra'' album as well as an autumn 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called ''In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/10/roy-orbison-with-royal-philharmonic-unchained-melodies-releases-1116-includes-duet-with-country-musi.html|title=Roy Orbison with Royal Philharmonic \"Unchained Melodies\" Releases 11/16, Includes Duet With Country Music Sensation Cam|website=Music News Net}}</ref>\n\n===Songwriting===\n\n====Structures====\nMusic critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions \"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\".<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 20\">Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, \"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\".<ref name=\"watrous\">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). \"Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold\". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name=\"nswhof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way.&nbsp;...

The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\"/>\n\n====Themes====\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]]. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy\u2014try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\".<ref name=\"watrous\"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a post-modern nerve\".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things&nbsp;... Before that no one would do it.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\n===Voice quality===\n{{Quote box\n | width = 30%\n | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time.

[[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard \"Crying\" for the first time, \"That was it.

When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 184.</ref> Bassist [[Jerry Scheff]], who backed Orbison in his ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' concert, wrote about him, \"Roy Orbison was like an opera singer.

During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age.

His parents worked in a defence plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, \"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.'
