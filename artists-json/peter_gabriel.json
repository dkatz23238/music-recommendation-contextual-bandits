He was raised in a middle-class family in Coxhill, a Victorian manor situated on Deep Pool Farm just outside Chobham.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=25}} His father, Ralph Parton Gabriel (1912\u20132012), was an electrical engineer and his mother, Edith Irene Gabriel (''n\u00e9e'' Allen), was from a musical family. His great-great-great-uncle, [[Sir Thomas Gabriel, 1st Baronet]], was [[Lord Mayor of London]] from 1866 to 1877.<ref name=TT07>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyhistory/3355127/Family-detective-Peter-Gabriel.html|title=Family detective: Peter Gabriel|date=24 November 2007|first=Nick|last=Barratt|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2 July 2019|archive-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702160342/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyhistory/3355127/Family-detective-Peter-Gabriel.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel attended Cable House, a private primary school in [[Woking]], Surrey, followed by St Andrews Preparatory School for Boys in [[Horsell]], Surrey.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=25}} During his time at the latter, his teachers noticed his singing talent, but he opted for piano lessons from his mother and developed an interest in drumming. At age 10, he purchased a floor tom-tom.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=26}}\n\nGabriel remarked of his early influences, \"[[Hymn]]s played quite a large part. They were the closest I came to [[soul music]] before I discovered soul music. There are certain hymns that you can scream your lungs out on, and I used to love that. It was great when you used to get the old shivers down the back.\"<ref name=\"White Shadow pp12\">[[Capital London|Capital Radio]] interview with [[Alan Freeman]], broadcast October 1982; transcribed in Gabriel fanzine ''White Shadow'' (#3, pp12) by editor Fred Tomsett</ref> At age 12, Gabriel wrote his first song, \"Sammy the Slug\". Around this time, an aunt gave him money for professional singing lessons, but he used it to buy [[the Beatles]]' first album ''[[Please Please Me]]''.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=26}} In September 1963, he started at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], a [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in [[Godalming]], Surrey.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} There, he was a drummer and vocalist for his first band: the [[trad jazz]] outfit the Milords (or M'Lords). This was followed by a holiday band called the Spoken Word.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=34}}\n\nIn 1965, Gabriel formed [[Garden Wall (band)|Garden Wall]] with school friends [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] on piano and [[Chris Stewart (author)|Chris Stewart]] on drums. Banks had started at Charterhouse at the same time as Gabriel; the two were uninterested in school activities but bonded over music and started to write songs. At a final concert before they split, Gabriel, dressed in a kaftan and beads, showered the audience with petals he had picked from neighbouring gardens.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}}\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1967\u20131975: Genesis ===\nIn 1967, after Garden Wall had disbanded, Gabriel, Banks, and Stewart were invited by fellow pupils [[Anthony Phillips]] and [[Mike Rutherford]] to work on a demo tape of songs. Gabriel and Banks contributed \"She is Beautiful\", the first song they wrote together. The tape was sent to former Charterhouse pupil turned musician [[Jonathan King]], who was immediately enthusiastic largely due to Gabriel's vocals. He signed the group and suggested a band name of Gabriel's Angels, but it was unpopular with the other members. They settled on King's other suggestion, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]. After King suggested they stick to more straightforward pop, Gabriel and Banks wrote \"[[The Silent Sun]]\" as a pastiche of the [[Bee Gees]], one of King's favourite bands. It became Genesis's first single, released in 1968.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=17}} It was included on their first studio album, ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'' (1968), which saw Gabriel play the flute.\n\nAfter the commercial failure of ''From Genesis to Revelation'', the band went their separate ways and Gabriel continued his studies at Charterhouse.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=22}} In September 1969, Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, and Phillips decided to drop their plans and make Genesis a full-time working band. In early 1970, Gabriel played the flute on ''[[Mona Bone Jakon]]'' (1970) by [[Cat Stevens]]. The second Genesis album, ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' (1970), marked Gabriel expanding his musical output with the accordion, tambourine, and bass drum, and incorporate his [[soul music]] influences. He wrote the lyrics to \"[[The Knife (song)|The Knife]]\" as a parody of a protest song. The album sold little and at one point, Gabriel secured a place at [[London Film School|London School of Film Technique]] because Genesis \"seemed to be dying.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mark|last=[[Mark Blake (writer)|Blake]]|title=Cash for questions: Peter Gabriel|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=December 2011|page=46}}</ref> Genesis recruited guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] after Gabriel spotted his advert in the ''[[Melody Maker]]''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=43}} Their next album, ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' (1971), features Gabriel playing the oboe. Its opener, \"[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]\", was their first song in which Gabriel incorporated a story and characters into the lyrics.\n\n[[File:Peter Gabriel The Moonlight Knight (cropped).png|thumb|upright|right|Gabriel as \"Britannia\", or \"[[Dancing with the Moonlit Knight|The Moonlit Knight]]\", 1974]]\n[[File:Peter Gabriel, April 1975.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gabriel performing during [[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour]], 1975]]\n\nThe shows featuring ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' (1972) marked a key development in Gabriel's stage performance. He had started to recite stories to introduce numbers as a way to cover the silence between songs, while the band tuned their instruments, or while technical faults were being fixed.<ref name=\"uncut.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/peter-gabriel-you-could-feel-the-horror-29379|title=Peter Gabriel: \"You could feel the horror ...\" \u2013 Uncut|date=19 October 2012|website=Uncut.co.uk|access-date=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023120219/http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/peter-gabriel-you-could-feel-the-horror-29379|archive-date=23 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> During a gig in [[Dublin]] in September 1972, he disappeared from the set during the instrumental section of \"[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]\" and reappeared in his wife's red dress and a fox's head, mimicking the album's cover. He kept the idea to himself as he felt the band would have voted against it. Despite some initial doubts from his bandmates, the incident received front-page coverage in ''Melody Maker'', giving them national exposure which allowed the group to double their performance fee. One of Gabriel's stories was printed on the liner notes of their live album, ''[[Genesis Live]]'' (1973). By late 1973, following the success of ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' (1973), which centred on English themes and literary references, a typical Genesis show had Gabriel wear fluorescent make-up, a cape, and bat wings for \"[[Watcher of the Skies]]\", a helmet, chest plate, and a shield for \"[[Dancing With the Moonlit Knight]]\", various costumes for \"[[Supper's Ready]]\", and an old man mask for \"The Musical Box\".\n\n''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'' (1974) was Gabriel's final album with Genesis. He devised its story of the spiritual journey of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City, and the bizarre incidents and characters he meets on the way. Tensions increased during this period as Gabriel wanted to write all of the lyrics himself, and split with the band after director [[William Friedkin]] had invited him to work on a screenplay. The project dissolved, and Gabriel returned to work with Genesis. Matters were complicated further with the difficult birth of Gabriel's first daughter, resulting in periods of time away from the band. In the end, Gabriel was late to deliver the lyrics and relied on contributions from Banks and Rutherford. In the liner notes, Gabriel is credited with \"experiments with foreign sounds\". He had [[Brian Eno]] provide additional electronic effects.\n\nDuring a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, early into the album's tour, Gabriel informed the band of his intention to leave at its conclusion.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=158}}{{failed verification|date=March 2021}} Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel's theatrics and took the band's musical performance as secondary, which irritated the rest of the band.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=93}} The tour ended in May 1975, after which Gabriel wrote a piece for the press on 15 August, entitled \"Out, Angels Out\", about his departure, his disillusion with the business, and his desire to spend time with his family.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=107}} The news stunned fans of the group and left commentators wondering if the band could survive without him.<ref name=\"Leaves Genesis\">{{cite news|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-leaves-genesis/|first=Dave|last=Swanson|title=38 Years Ago: Peter Gabriel Leaves Genesis|website=Ultimateclassicrock.com|date=15 August 2013|access-date=13 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821051141/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-leaves-genesis/|archive-date=21 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Reunion\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10903747/Genesis-back-together-after-nearly-40-years.html|first=Anita|last=Singh|title=Genesis back together after nearly 40 years|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 June 2014|access-date=13 August 2015|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924202057/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10903747/Genesis-back-together-after-nearly-40-years.html|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> His exit resulted in drummer [[Phil Collins]] reluctantly taking over on lead vocals after 400 singers were fruitlessly auditioned.\n\n=== 1975\u20131985: Solo debut with ''Peter Gabriel'' albums ===\nGabriel described his break from music as his \"learning period\", during which he took piano and music lessons.

All were labelled ''Peter Gabriel'', using the same typeface, with designs by [[Hipgnosis]]. \"The idea is to do it like a magazine, which will only come out once a year,\" he remarked in 1978. \"So it's the same title, the same lettering in the same place; only the photo is different.\"<ref>''Best'' magazine, May 1978; translated in Gabriel fanzine ''White Shadow'' (#1, pp13) by editor Fred Tomsett</ref> Each album has, however, been given a nickname by fans, usually relating to the album cover.\n\n''Peter Gabriel'' (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 1: Car) was released in February 1977 and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 38 in the US. Its lead single, \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\", is an autobiographical song about a spiritual experience on top of [[Solsbury Hill]] in Somerset. \"It's about being prepared to lose what you have for what you might get&nbsp;...\" said Gabriel. \"It's about letting go.\"{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=203}} Gabriel toured the album with an 80-date tour from March to November 1977 with a band that included guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] often playing off stage and introduced as \"Dusty Rhodes\".\n\n[[File:Peter gabriel 31081978 02 400.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gabriel on stage in 1978]]\nIn late 1977, Gabriel started recording the [[Peter Gabriel (1978 album)|second ''Peter Gabriel'' album]] (a.k.a.

Released in June 1978, the album went to No. 10 in the UK and No. 45 in the US. Gabriel's tour for the album lasted from August to December 1978. On this tour, Gabriel and his band shaved their heads.\n\nGabriel recorded the [[Peter Gabriel (1980 album)|third ''Peter Gabriel'' album]] (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 3: Melt) in England in 1979.

Its soundtrack was released as ''[[Passion (Peter Gabriel album)|Passion]]'' in June 1989. It won Gabriel a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best New Age Album|Best New Age Performance]] and a nomination for a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score \u2013 Motion Picture]].

The album saw Gabriel address personal themes, including his failed first marriage, psychotherapy, and the growing distance between him and his eldest daughter at the time.\n\nGabriel's introspection within the context of the album ''Us'' can be seen in the first single release \"[[Digging in the Dirt]]\" directed by John Downer. Accompanied by a disturbing video featuring Gabriel covered in snails and various foliage, this song made reference to the psychotherapy which had taken up much of Gabriel's time since the previous album. Gabriel describes his struggle to get through to his daughter in \"Come Talk To Me\" directed by [[Matt Mahurin]], which featured backing vocals by [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]]. O'Connor also lent vocals to \"Blood of Eden\", directed by [[Nichola Bruce]] and Michael Coulson, the third single to be released from the album, and once again dealing with relationship struggles, this time going right back to [[Adam]]'s rib for inspiration. The result was one of Gabriel's most personal albums. It met with less success than ''So'', reaching No. 2 in the album chart on both sides of the Atlantic, and making modest chart impact with the singles \"Digging in the Dirt\" and the funkier \"[[Steam (Peter Gabriel song)|Steam]]\", which evoked memories of \"Sledgehammer\".

Not wishing to feature only images of himself, he asked artist filmmakers [[Nichola Bruce]] and Michael Coulson to co-ordinate a marketing campaign using contemporary artists. Artists such as [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Rebecca Horn]], [[Nils-Udo]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[David Mach]] and [[Yayoi Kusama]] collaborated to create original artworks for each of the 11 songs on the multi-million-selling CD. Coulson and Bruce documented the process on Hi-8 video. Bruce left Real World and Coulson continued with the campaign, using the documentary background material as the basis for a promotional EPK, the long-form video ''All About Us'' and the interactive CD-ROM ''[[Xplora1]]''.\n\nGabriel won three more [[Grammy Awards]], all in the Music Video category. He won the [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video]] in 1993 and 1994 for the videos to \"Digging in the Dirt\" and \"Steam\" respectively.
