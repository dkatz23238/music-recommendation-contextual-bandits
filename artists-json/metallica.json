Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] and bassist [[Robert Trujillo]]. Guitarist [[Dave Mustaine]] (who formed Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists [[Ron McGovney]], [[Cliff Burton]] and [[Jason Newsted]] are former members of the band.\n\nMetallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' (1986), cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' (1988), gave Metallica its first [[Grammy Award]] nomination. Their self-titled fifth album, ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'' (1991), was the band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the [[Nielsen SoundScan|SoundScan]] era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, ''[[Death Magnetic]]'' (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's most recent album is ''[[Hardwired... to Self-Destruct]]'' (2016).\n\nIn 2000, Metallica [[Metallica v. Napster, Inc.|led the case]] against the [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] service [[Napster]], in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 [[documentary film]] ''[[Metallica: Some Kind of Monster]]'', which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, ''[[St. Anger]]'' (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside [[Dane DeHaan]] in the 2013 concert film ''[[Metallica: Through the Never]]'', in which the band performed live against a fictional [[Thriller film|thriller]] storyline.\n\nMetallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, twelve video albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with ''Metallica'') have consecutively debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Metallica ranks as one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|most commercially successful bands of all time]], having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018.<ref name=\"sold\">{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Mark|title=Metallica to get 'Nobel Prize of music'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43049190|work=[[BBC]]|date=February 14, 2018|access-date=March 23, 2018|archive-date=August 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808112445/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43049190|url-status=live}}</ref> Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', which ranked them at no. 61 on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|''100 Greatest Artists of All Time'']] list.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Metallica \u2013 100 Greatest Artists|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/metallica-20110426|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=May 12, 2017|date=December 3, 2010|archive-date=April 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423055947/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/metallica-20110426|url-status=live}}</ref> As of 2017, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since [[Nielsen Soundscan|Nielsen SoundScan]] began tracking sales in 1991,<ref name=\"Album Sales 1\">{{cite magazine|last1=Trust|last2=Caulfield|first1=Gary|first2=Keith|title=Eminem Marks Sales, Hot 100 Milestones|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/chart-alert/5944789/eminem-marks-sales-hot-100-milestones|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=March 21, 2014|access-date=September 7, 2014|archive-date=April 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410123748/https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/chart-alert/5944789/eminem-marks-sales-hot-100-milestones|url-status=live}}</ref> selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|title=Billboard 200 Chart Moves: Metallica's 'Hardwired' Hits 1 Million Sold in the U.S.|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7857905/billboard-200-chart-metallica-hardwired|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 7, 2017|access-date=July 7, 2017|archive-date=July 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709123812/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7857905/billboard-200-chart-metallica-hardwired|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1981\u20131984: Formation, early years, and ''Kill 'Em All''===\n[[File:Metallica wordmark.svg|thumb|The classic Metallica logo, designed by James Hetfield and used on most of the band's releases.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Lauren|title=Metallica \u2013 Best Band Logos|url=http://loudwire.com/metallica-best-band-logos/|website=LoudWire|access-date=October 9, 2017|archive-date=October 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009092623/http://loudwire.com/metallica-best-band-logos/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Kimmy|first1=Jimmy|title=How Metallica Created Their Iconic Logo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbskx4Ha2rc|website=YouTube|access-date=October 9, 2017|archive-date=April 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404041233/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbskx4Ha2rc|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\nMetallica was formed in [[Los Angeles]] in late 1981 when Danish drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, ''[[The Recycler]]'', which read, \"Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with [[Tygers of Pan Tang]], [[Diamond Head (English band)|Diamond Head]] and [[Iron Maiden]].\"<ref name=\"Timeline 1\">{{cite web|title=Metallica Timeline Early 1981 \u2013 Early 1982|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315095541/http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=1|publisher=MTV|archive-date=March 15, 2009|access-date=May 28, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Guitarists [[James Hetfield]] and Hugh Tanner of [[Leather Charm]] answered the advertisement.
