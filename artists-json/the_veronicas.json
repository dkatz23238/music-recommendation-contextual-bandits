The group was formed in 2004 by identical twin sisters [[Lisa Origliasso|Lisa]] and [[Jessica Origliasso]].\n\nIn 2005, the Veronicas released their debut studio album, titled ''[[The Secret Life Of... (album)|The Secret Life of...]]'', which peaked at number two on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Album Chart]] and was certified [[ARIA certification|4\u00d7 platinum]] by [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) for selling over 280,000 copies. The album spawned five singles, led by \"[[4ever (The Veronicas song)|4ever]]\", three of which were top ten singles in Australia. In 2007, the duo released their second studio album, ''[[Hook Me Up]]'', which also peaked at number two in Australia and was certified 2\u00d7 platinum for selling over 140,000 copies. The album garnered four Australian top ten singles. The album's title track, \"[[Hook Me Up (song)|Hook Me Up]]\", was the Veronicas' first number one single in Australia,<ref>[http://www.mtviggy.com/video/music-video-the-veronicas-hook-me-up The Veronicas- \"Hook Me Up\"] MTV Iggy</ref> while \"[[Untouched (song)|Untouched]]\" was an international top-ten hit.\n\nFollowing a lengthy hiatus (broken only by the July 2012 release of the Australian top-40 single \"[[Lolita (The Veronicas song)|Lolita]]\" and various gigs for their fans), in September 2014, the Veronicas released \"[[You Ruin Me]]\", the first single from their [[The Veronicas (album)|self-titled third studio album]]. The song debuted at number one on the ARIA chart, becoming the women's second chart-topping single and their first to debut in the top spot. It also charted in United States and United Kingdom. The album was released both physically and digitally on 21 November 2014.<ref>\n{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30051670 |title=The Veronicas' triumphant return from pop purgatory \u2013 BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 17 November 2014|access-date=3 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218224858/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30051670 |archive-date=18 February 2015 |url-status=live  |work=BBC News |last1=Savage |first1=Mark }}\n</ref> In 2016, they hosted the [[ARIA Music Awards]].<ref name=\"ARIAAwards\">\n{{cite news|date=November 2016|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11754079|title=The Veronicas' topless glitch at the 2016 ARIA Awards|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|work=News Corp Australia Network|author=Shoba Rao|access-date=24 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124193813/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11754079|archive-date=24 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> They spent most of the period between 2016 and 2021 releasing gold and platinum singles in Australia, leading to the release of both their fourth and fifth albums, ''[[Godzilla (The Veronicas album)|Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Human (The Veronicas album)|Human]]'', in May and June 2021, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-veronicas-announce-albums-godzilla-human-24541/|title=The Veronicas Announce Two New Albums, 'GODZILLA' and 'HUMAN'|date=25 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2020, the sisters were announced as competing celebrity contestants on the fifth season of ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice Australia]]'' in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2020/10/the-veronicas-take-on-celebrity-apprentice.html|title=Celebrities revealed for Celebrity Apprentice|publisher=TV Tonight|date=12 October 2020|access-date=12 October 2020|first=David|last=Knox}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn 2001, the identical twins Lisa and Jessica Origlasso made their first demonstration recordings with Brisbane producer [[Stuart Stuart]] at Analog Heart Records. Stuart produced an EP in a more electronic style and, a year later, a second batch of songs in the pop rock style that the group initially became known for.\n\nIn 2004, the sisters, who were then performing as \"The Twins\" (and who were being managed by their father Joseph Origliasso at that time), were introduced by Gabrielle McKinley to Robin Donald Smith. Smith was a former operatic tenor who had performed overseas with the Sadlers Well Opera and at the Sydney Opera House with the Australian Opera, who owned the recording and music publishing company Multiplay Music Australia. After meeting Joseph and auditioning Lisa and Jessica, Multiplay Music Australia offered to sign The Twins to their first recording and music publishing agreements.\n\nAfter signing the Twins, the following year Smith and Bell, funded by Multiplay Music Australia, took the Twins on several world-wide songwriting trips to Britain, Sweden, Canada and the US in order for them to collaborate with top songwriters in each country to further develop their songwriting skills. These included Clif Magness (who has written with [[Avril Lavigne]]), [[Billy Steinberg]] ([[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Cyndi Lauper]]), [[Max Martin]] ([[Britney Spears]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Pink (singer)|P!nk]]), Eric Nova, Dead Mono and Vince DeGiorgio, where they created a catalogue of over 50 songs.<ref name=\"The Veronicas: About\">{{cite web|title=Official Website: About |url=http://www.theveronicas.com/indexhtml.html#aboutanchor |access-date=30 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612171103/http://www.theveronicas.com/indexhtml.html#aboutanchor |archive-date=12 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2014}}\n\nMultiplay also secured introductions and auditions for them with numerous recording companies, including Sony, EMI, Universal, BMG and Warner Music.\n\nOn their return to Australia, Smith and Bell met with the executives at Engine Room (a subsidiary of PBL (Packer) Group). Throughout the year Multiplay then negotiated with Engine Room to contract the Twins to secure a recording contracts with Warner Music.\n\nMeetings were then arranged with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in the US. [[Seymour Stein]] and senior executives recognised that Smith and Bell had discovered and developed a musical talent, signing them quickly to a recording contract with Warner Bros.
