According to the documentary ''[[Take That: For the Record]]'', his mother read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested that he try out for the group. He met fellow member [[Mark Owen]] on the day of his audition/interview with [[Nigel Martin-Smith]]. Although the majority of the group's material was written and performed by [[Gary Barlow]], Williams performed lead vocals on their first Top Three hit \"[[Could It Be Magic]]\", as well as \"[[I Found Heaven]]\", and \"[[Everything Changes (Take That song)|Everything Changes]]\". Williams' use of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]] brought him into conflict with Martin-Smith over the behaviour rules for Take That members.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1479447/Robbie-Drugs-gave-me-best-times-of-my-life.html \"Robbie: 'Drugs gave me best times of my life'].

Barlow explained in interviews that Williams had given up trying to offer creative input.\n\nNoting Williams' increasingly belligerent behaviour and poor attendance at rehearsals, and worried that he might leave the group during their upcoming tour, Orange and Barlow took their concerns to Martin-Smith. During one of the last rehearsals before the tour commenced, the three confronted Williams about his attitude and stated they wanted to do the tour without him. He agreed to quit and left the group in July 1995; it would be the last time for twelve years that they were all together. Despite the departure of Williams, Take That completed their [[Nobody Else Tour]] as a four-piece. They later disbanded on 13 February 1996, Williams's 22nd birthday.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/broken-promises-as-take-that-can-take-no-more-1318879.html \"Broken promises as Take That can take no more\"].

Following his departure, he became the subject of talk shows and newspapers as he acknowledged his plans to become a solo singer, and he was spotted partying with [[George Michael]] in France. However, a clause in his Take That contract prohibited him from releasing any material until after the group was officially dissolved, and he was later sued by Martin-Smith and forced to pay $200,000 in commission. After various legal battles over his right to a solo career, Williams succeeded in getting released from his contract with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. On 27 June 1996, Williams signed with [[Chrysalis Records]].\n\n===2006\u20132011: second stint===\n[[File:Robbie Williams at Sunderland 2011a crop.jpg|thumb|210px|Williams performing in Take That's [[Progress Live]] tour in 2011.
