The son of a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]], he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of [[Delta blues]]. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including [[talking blues]] and early North Mississippi [[hill country blues]]. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s\u20131940s piano-derived [[boogie-woogie]].

Most official sources list 1917, though at times Hooker stated he was born in 1920.  Information found in the 1920 and 1930 censuses indicates that he was actually born in 1912.<ref name=\"bare\"/>  In 2017, a series of events took place to celebrate the purported centenary of his birth.<ref>Brian McCollum, [http://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/05/01/john-lee-hooker-100th-centennial-tribute-grammy/101027412 \"John Lee Hooker to get year-long 100th birthday tribute\"], ''Detroit Free Press'', May 1, 2017.</ref> In the 1920 federal census, John Hooker is seven years old and one of nine children living with William and Minnie Hooker in [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]].\n\nIt is believed that he was born in Tutwiler, in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his birthplace was near [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in Coahoma County.<ref name=\"palmer\"/> He was the youngest of the 11 children of William Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923),<ref>According to ''Boogie Man'', p. 24, \"In 1928, Will Hooker Sr. and Jr. made a profit of twenty-eight dollars\" from farming, making his death in 1923 impossible.</ref> a [[sharecropper]] and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c. 1880, date of death unknown). In the 1920 federal census,<ref>U.S. Census, Series T625, Roll 895, p. 235, in the city of Tutwiler, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, Supervisor's District 2, Enumeration District 87, Sheet 29 A, Lines 18\u201319, enumerated February 3, 1920.</ref> William and Minnie were recorded as being 48 and 39 years old, respectively, which implies that Minnie was born about 1880, not 1875. She was said to have been a \"decade or so younger\" than her husband (''Boogie Man'', p.&nbsp;23), which gives additional credibility to this census record as evidence of Hooker's origins.\n\nThe Hooker children were [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]]. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the [[spirituals]] sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).<ref>Oliver, Paul. ''Conversation with the Blues''. p. 188. See also Bennett, Joe; Curwen, Trevor; Douse, Cliff. ''Guitar Facts''. p. 76.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nMoore was his first significant blues influence. He was a local blues guitarist who, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the [[Delta blues]] of the time.<ref name=\"palmer\">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Palmer|year=1982|title=Deep Blues|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242 242\u201343]|isbn=0-14-006223-8|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242}}</ref>\n\nAnother influence was [[Tony Hollins]], who dated Hooker's sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were versions of \"[[Crawlin' King Snake]]\" and \"[[Robert Petway#Catfish Blues|Catfish Blues]]\".<ref>Murray, Charles Shaar (2011).

He frequented the blues clubs and bars on [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects|Hastings Street]], the heart of the black entertainment district, on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Hooker's popularity grew quickly as he performed in Detroit clubs, and, seeking an instrument louder than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.<ref name=\"oliver\">{{cite book|first=Terry|last=Wogan|year=1984|title=Shoes Off the Record|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bluesoffrecordth00oliv/page/116 116\u201318]|isbn=0-306-80321-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bluesoffrecordth00oliv/page/116}}</ref>\n\n==Earlier career==\nHooker was working as janitor in a Detroit steel mill when his recording career began in 1948,<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|year=1981|author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242 242]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242}}</ref> when [[Modern Records]], based in Los Angeles, released a demo he had recorded for Bernie Besman in Detroit.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|year=1981|author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/243 243]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/243}}</ref> The single, \"[[Boogie Chillen']]{{-\"}}, became a hit and the best-selling [[race record]] of 1949.<ref name=\"palmer\"/> Though illiterate,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hooker, John Lee {{!}} Detroit Historical Society|url=https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/hooker-john-lee|access-date=2020-10-30|website=detroithistorical.org}}</ref> Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting [[traditional blues verses|traditional blues lyrics]], he composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for [[Chess Records]] and [[Chance Records]] in 1951\u20131952), Johnny Lee (for [[De Luxe Records]] in 1953\u20131954), John Lee, John Lee Cooker,<ref>Liner notes.

This often made it difficult to use backing musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.<ref>''Boogie Man'', p. 121.</ref>\n\nFor much of this period he recorded and toured with [[Eddie Kirkland]].
