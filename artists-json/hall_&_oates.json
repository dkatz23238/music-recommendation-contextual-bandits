Despite touring constantly and recording albums with efficiency, the duo could not find any pop success for a number of reasons, mainly because of the popularity of the disco genre. By the time they released the rock-oriented albums ''[[Beauty on a Back Street]]'' in 1977 and ''[[Along the Red Ledge]]'' in 1978, disco music was trendy and taking most of the spots in popular music. \n\nThey did release a few hit singles during this period: the follow-up to \"Rich Girl\" (\"Back Together Again\") hit the Top 40, and \"It's A Laugh\" (from \"Along The Red Ledge\") hit the top 20 in 1978. In 1977, RCA attempted to push Hall to the fore with his first solo effort ''[[Sacred Songs]]''. However, after being presented with the highly experimental recording (produced by [[Robert Fripp]] of [[King Crimson]]), RCA became unwilling to release what was, in their view, a non-commercial album. ''Sacred Songs'' was eventually released in 1980.{{cn|date=February 2021}}\n\n=== 1979\u20131981: ''X-Static'' and ''Voices'' ===\nThe 1980s brought about significant changes for Hall and Oates. The pair felt that the biggest hindrance to their success was that their music was being filtered through outside producers, and that studio musicians were not familiar with their own tastes and thoughts. In 1979, they hired [[G. E. Smith]] (who had worked with [[Dan Hartman]] and [[David Bowie]] by then) as lead guitarist, [[Mickey Curry]] as drummer in 1980 and later in 1981 [[Tom \"T-Bone\" Wolk]] joined as bassist. They also enlisted Hall's girlfriend Sara Allen (and also her younger sister [[Janna Allen|Janna]]) as songwriting collaborators, as well as beginning a working relationship with [[Neil Kernon]], an engineer on ''Voices'' who worked as co-producer on their succeeding two albums.{{cn|date=February 2021}} In late 1979, Hall and Oates released ''[[X-Static]]'', which combined rock with [[disco]].<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> The album did not fare well, although \"[[Wait for Me (Hall & Oates song)|Wait for Me]]\" did hit the top 20. \n\nThe band also wished to capture the sound of [[New York City]] which, by then, had become their home.{{cn|date=February 2021}} As a result, instead of recording in [[Los Angeles]], as they had done previously, they decided to record at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City, just five minutes away from their apartments, and began producing their own recordings with their touring band backing them in the studio. \n\nThe resulting album, ''[[Voices (Hall & Oates album)|Voices]]'', was written, produced and arranged by Hall and Oates in one month, according to their authorized biography ''Dangerous Dances'' (by [[Nick Tosches]]). The first two singles from the album charted fairly well, with \"[[How Does It Feel to Be Back]]\" charting at Number 30. The well-received [[cover version|cover]] of [[The Righteous Brothers]]' \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\",<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> just missed the Top 10, peaking at Number 12, but spent 14 weeks in the Top 40. After the release of that song, Oates's contribution as the lead vocalist diminished on future releases. The third single \"[[Kiss on My List]]\" hit Number 1 in April 1981 and remained there for three weeks. The follow-up single \"[[You Make My Dreams]]\" reached Number 5 in July of that year.{{cn|date=February 2021}}\n\nThe other well-known song from ''Voices'' is the emotive ballad \"[[Everytime You Go Away]]\", with powerful lead vocals by Hall, who wrote it.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> British singer [[Paul Young (singer and guitarist)|Paul Young]] had a ''Billboard'' Number 1 hit with a cover of the song in 1985.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> Though the Hall and Oates original (recorded in a Memphis-soul style) was never released as a single, it remains a fan favorite on the duo's greatest hits albums, and was featured on their [[Live at the Apollo (Hall & Oates album)|Apollo Theater album]] in 1985, and is frequently featured in their live set to this day.{{cn|date=February 2021}}\n\n=== 1981\u20131982: ''Private Eyes'' ===\nBy the time \"You Make My Dreams\" was falling off the charts, Hall and Oates had already released their follow-up album ''[[Private Eyes (Hall & Oates album)|Private Eyes]]''.

They had five Number 1 singles to their credit, two consecutive Top 10 albums and were one of the biggest names on [[MTV]].{{cn|date=February 2021}} Two covers of the 1957 [[Bobby Helms]] classic \"[[Jingle Bell Rock]]\" were recorded\u2014one with Hall on lead vocals, and the other with Oates on lead vocals\u2014and released in time for Christmas 1983, complete with a humorous video of the band, that received extensive airplay on [[MTV]]. In 1983, they released their first greatest hits album entitled ''[[Rock 'n Soul Part 1]]''. The album peaked at Number 7, and the two new songs that were written and recorded for that LP also became Top 10 hits as well.{{cn|date=February 2021}}\n\nThe first single released from this album, \"[[Say It Isn't So (Hall & Oates song)|Say It Isn't So]]\", battled six weeks for the Number 1 spot with [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Say Say Say]]\" at the peak of ''[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]'' mania. \"Say It Isn't So\" remained at No. 2 for four weeks from December 1983 to January 1984.{{cn|date=February 2021}}\n\n{{listen|pos=right|filename=Hall & Oates - Adult Education.ogg|title=\"Adult Education\"|Type=single}}\nHall and Oates's follow-up single \"[[Adult Education (song)|Adult Education]]\" received heavy airplay at both pop and black (urban contemporary) radio, and reached Number 8 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in April 1984.

This album had even more of an electronic, urban feel to it than ''H<sub>2</sub>O'', combining their song structure and vocalization with the latest technical advances in recording and playing.{{cn|date=February 2021}} The album employed some of the most sophisticated equipment ever used in the recording industry at the time (most notably the [[Synclavier]] II, one of the first computerized synthesizer workstations, as well as the [[Fairlight CMI]]).

In 1989, they covered and did their own version of the [[The O'Jays|O'Jays]] song ''[[Love Train]]'' for the movie ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]''.{{cn|date=February 2021}}\n\n=== 1991\u20132006: ''Do It for Love'' and Christmas album ===\nThe duo's occasional song-writing collaborator [[Janna Allen]] died of [[leukemia]] in 1993.
