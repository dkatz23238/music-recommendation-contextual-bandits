Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984 [[The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)|self-titled debut album]], which instead featured guitarist [[Jack Sherman]] and drummer [[Cliff Martinez]]. Slovak rejoined for their second album, ''[[Freaky Styley]]'' (1985), and Irons for their third, ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]'' (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a [[drug overdose]] in June 1988.\n\nWith new recruits Frusciante and Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded ''[[Mother's Milk (album)|Mother's Milk]]'' (1989) and their first major commercial success, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by [[Dave Navarro]], who appeared on the group's sixth album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'' (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. ''[[By the Way]]'' (2002) and ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' (2006) were also successful; ''Stadium Arcadium'' was their first album to reach number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by [[Josh Klinghoffer]], who appeared on ''[[I'm with You (album)|I'm with You]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Getaway (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|The Getaway]]'' (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. They released their 12th album, ''[[Unlimited Love]]'', in 2022. Their 13th album, ''[[Return of the Dream Canteen]]'', was released in October of the same year.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://music.redhotchilipeppers.com/products/return-of-the-dream-canteen-cd | title=Return of the Dream Canteen CD }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== 1983\u20131984: Early history ===\n[[File:HillelSlovak1983.jpg|thumb|Founding guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]] performing in [[Philadelphia]] in 1985.
