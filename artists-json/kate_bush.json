In 1978, at the age of 19, she topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] for four weeks with her debut single \"[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]\", becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number one with a self-written song.<ref name=\":2\" /> Bush has since released 25 UK [[Top 40]] singles, including the Top 10 hits \"[[The Man with the Child in His Eyes]]\", \"[[Babooshka (song)|Babooshka]]\", \"[[Running Up That Hill]]\", \"[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]\" (a duet with [[Peter Gabriel]]) and \"[[King of the Mountain (Kate Bush song)|King of the Mountain]]\". All ten of her studio albums reached the UK Top 10, with all bar one reaching the top five, including the UK number one albums ''[[Never for Ever]]'' (1980), ''[[Hounds of Love]]'' (1985) and the compilation ''[[The Whole Story]]'' (1986). She was the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist to enter the album chart at number one.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\" />\n\nBush began writing songs at 11. She was signed to [[EMI Records]] after [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[David Gilmour]] helped produce a demo tape. Her debut album, ''[[The Kick Inside]]'', was released in 1978. Bush slowly gained artistic independence in album production and has produced all her studio albums since ''[[The Dreaming (album)|The Dreaming]]'' (1982). She took a hiatus between her seventh and eighth albums, ''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1993) and ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]'' (2005). Bush drew attention again in 2014 with her concert residency [[Before the Dawn (Kate Bush concert residency)|Before the Dawn]], her first shows since 1979's [[The Tour of Life]]. In 2022, her 1985 song \"Running Up That Hill\" received renewed global attention after being featured in the [[Stranger Things (season 4)|fourth season]] of the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Stranger Things]]'', which led to the single becoming her second UK number one and reaching the top of several other charts. The song also reached number 3 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], Bush's first release to reach the top 10 of a US singles chart; its parent album, ''Hounds of Love'', became Bush's first album to reach the top of a [[Jazz Albums|''Billboard'' albums chart]].\n\nBush's [[Eclecticism in music|eclectic]] musical style, unconventional lyrics, performances and literary themes have influenced a diverse range of artists. She has received 13 [[Brit Awards]] nominations, winning for [[Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist|Best British Female Artist]] in 1987, and has been nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]].<ref name=\"brits\" /><ref name=\"brits87\">{{cite web |title=The BRITs 1987 |url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1987 |website=[[Brit Awards]] |access-date=11 April 2015 |archive-date=17 March 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140317150236/http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1987 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2002, Bush was recognised with an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

The interview quoted Bush as saying: \"I actually really like her and think she's wonderful. I think it's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time ...

She's very sensible and I think that's a good thing at this point in time.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> In 2019, Bush published a clarifying statement on her website saying that she was not a Conservative Party supporter and did not endorse any political parties.
