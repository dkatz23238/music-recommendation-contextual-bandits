This is not a typo and should not be changed without good reason.-->David Campbell'''; July 8, 1970) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He rose to fame in the early 1990s with his [[Experimental music|experimental]] and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] style, and became known for creating musical collages of wide-ranging genres. He has musically encompassed [[Folk music|folk]], [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[alternative rock]], [[Country music|country]], and [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]]. He has released 14 studio albums (three of which were released on indie labels), as well as several non-album singles and a book of sheet music.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Beck grew towards hip-hop and folk in his teens and began to perform locally at coffeehouses and clubs. He moved to New York City in 1989 and became involved in the city's [[anti-folk]] movement. Returning to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, he cut his breakthrough single \"[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]]\", which became a worldwide hit in 1994, and released his first major album, ''[[Mellow Gold]]'', the same year. ''[[Odelay]]'', released in 1996, topped critic polls and won several awards. He released the country-influenced, twangy ''[[Mutations (Beck album)|Mutations]]'' in 1998, and the funk-infused ''[[Midnite Vultures]]'' in 1999. The soft-acoustic ''[[Sea Change (album)|Sea Change]]'' in 2002 showcased a more serious Beck, and 2005's ''[[Guero]]'' returned to ''Odelay''{{'}}s [[sample (music)|sample]]-based production. ''[[The Information (Beck album)|The Information]]'' in 2006 was inspired by electro-funk, hip hop, and psychedelia; 2008's ''[[Modern Guilt]]'' was inspired by '60s pop music; and 2014's folk-infused ''[[Morning Phase]]'' won [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[57th Grammy Awards]]. His 2017 album, ''[[Colors (Beck album)|Colors]]'', won awards for Best Alternative Album and Best Engineered Album at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]]. His fourteenth studio album, ''[[Hyperspace (album)|Hyperspace]]'', was released on November 22, 2019.\n\nWith a [[pop art]] collage of musical styles, oblique and [[irony|ironic]] lyrics, and [[postmodern]] arrangements incorporating [[sample (music)|samples]], [[drum machine]]s, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics and the public throughout his musical career as being among the most idiosyncratically creative musicians of 1990s and 2000s [[alternative rock]]. Two of Beck's most popular and acclaimed recordings are ''Odelay'' and ''Sea Change'', both of which were ranked on ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]]. The four-time [[RIAA certification|platinum]] artist has collaborated with several artists and has made several contributions to soundtracks.\n\n==Early life==\nBeck was born Bek David Campbell<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 25, 2008|url=http://www.tv.com/beck/person/48794/summary.html|title=Beck|publisher=[[TV.com]]| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080507071853/http://www.tv.com/beck/person/48794/summary.html| archive-date= May 7, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 25, 2008|url=http://www.jewsrock.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=words.view&wordid=3FC1DBF2-9A54-4545-B7F31CC252768881|title=Rocking the Catskills|publisher=Jews Rock|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611071044/http://www.jewsrock.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=words.view&wordid=3FC1DBF2-9A54-4545-B7F31CC252768881 |archive-date = June 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> in [[Los Angeles, California]], on July 8, 1970,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martell|first1=Nevin|title=Beck: The Art of Mutation|date=2002|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=9780743424486|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjlVMqXlYXQC}}</ref> the son of American visual artist [[Bibbe Hansen]] and Canadian arranger, composer, and conductor [[David Campbell (composer)|David Campbell]].<ref name=rsencyclopedia>George-Warren, Holly and Romanowski, Patricia.
