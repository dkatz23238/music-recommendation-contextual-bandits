The family moved to [[Pasadena, California]], in 1962. Young Edward soon began learning classical piano [[Playing by ear|by ear]], and became so proficient he won an annual piano recital contest 2 or 3 years in a row, despite never mastering the art of [[sight-reading]] [[sheet music]]. The brothers began playing music together in the 1960s, Eddie on drums and Alex on guitar. However, while Ed was delivering newspapers to payoff his drum set, Alex would secretly develop a passion and proficiency at them. Eventually out of frustration and brotherly competition, Ed told Alex, \"OK, you play drums and I'll play your guitar.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Everybody Wants Some: The Van Halen Saga by Ian Christie, {{ISBN|978-0-470-03910-6}}</ref>\n\nThe Van Halen brothers formed their very first band, the Broken Combs, in 1964. As they gained popularity playing backyard parties and local high school functions, they changed their name first to the Trojan Rubber Co, then in 1972 to Genesis, later still to Mammoth when they discovered  [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] was already in use by a major-label British band. At this time Eddie was both vocalist and lead guitarist and friend Mark Stone on bass. They rented a [[public address system|sound-system]] from Indiana-born, Pasadena transplant [[David Lee Roth]] for $10 per night. The loquacious, worldly, energetic son of a local ophthalmologist, Roth fronted a local R & B influenced rock band the Red Ball Jets. Roth's uncle Manny owned NYC's Bleecker street [[Cafe Wha?]] until 1968. Partly to save money, they now invited Roth to join as their lead vocalist despite previous unconvincing audition(s).<ref name=\"guitarcom\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vhlinks.com/pages/interviews/evh/gu072378.php |title=Eddie van Halen |access-date=August 13, 2007}}</ref> Ultimately Roth's charismatic \"[[Jim Dandy (song)|Jim Dandy]]\" approach would be both an artistic foil to Eddie's circumspect, guitar prodigy talents as well as allowing Eddie to focus his energies on song composition.  \n\n[[File:Van halen at La Canada High School 1976.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Van Halen performing at [[La Ca\u00f1ada High School]] in 1975.]]\nIn 1973, Mammoth officially changed its name to Van Halen.<ref name=\"Van Halen\"/> According to Roth,<ref>''Crazy from the Heat'' by David Lee Roth</ref> this was his brainchild. He felt it was a name that held long-term identity, artistic and marketing advantages, like [[Santana (band)|Santana]]. They continued to play Pasadena, San Bernardino, and Venice at clubs, festivals, backyard parties and city parks like Hamilton, drawing up to 2000 people. Traffic jams and noise complaints to the local police often ensued, as far away as San Pedro.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1974-12-18|title=Early Van Halen gig, at the Christmas Family Festival at the Greek Theatre.

[[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony Sobolewski]], a Pasadena college music-classmate of Eddie's, joined the group after an all-night jam session. He had sung and played bass in a number of less successful Arcadia backyard-party bands, including \"Snake\".

The Doors had also 'broken' there in the late 60s. Owner, Bill Gazzarri previously claimed VH was \"too loud\". However, their new managers, Mark Algorri and Mario Miranda, took over the club's hiring and booked them through 1976.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\nBy the Spring of 1975, they were also the regular Tuesday night band at Myron's Ballroom.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1975-03-21|title=Van Halen.

Warner offered the band a rather basic two album recording contract, one that heavily favored Warner, paying the four young men only $0.70 per unit (album) sold, a deal that would leave the band over $1 million in debt at the conclusion of their first supporting tour as the opening act for [[Journey (band)|Journey]] and [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jas |last=Obrecht |url=http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?doc_id=81828&src=3SOSWXXA |title=A Legend is Born Eddie Van Halen's First Interview |publisher=Musician's Friend |access-date=November 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218222440/http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?doc_id=81828&src=3SOSWXXA |archive-date=December 18, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The group recorded their debut album at [[Sunset Sound Recorders]] studio from mid-September to early October 1977, recording guitar parts for one week and then vocals for two additional. All of the tracks were laid down with little [[Overdub|over-dubbing]] or multi-tracking. Minor mistakes were purposely left on the record and a very rudimentary instrument set-up was used to give the record a live feel. During this time, they continued to play various venues in Southern California, including some notable concerts at the Pasadena Convention Center produced by their promoter and impresario, Steve Tortomasi, himself a fixture in the local rock and roll scene.\n\nUpon its release, ''[[Van Halen (album)|Van Halen]]'' reached No. 19 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] pop music charts, one of rock's most commercially successful debuts.<ref name=\"bestselling70s\">{{cite web|url=http://webalmanac.allinfoabout.com/music/1970.html |title=1970s: 100 Best-Selling Albums |publisher=All Info About Web Almanac |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105211239/http://webalmanac.allinfoabout.com/music/1970.html |archive-date=January 5, 2007}}</ref> It was highly regarded as both a heavy metal and hard rock album.<ref name=\"rollingstonetop500\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/rs500/listing9.lasso|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531104356/http://www.rhino.com/rs500/listing9.lasso|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 31, 2009|title=Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums Ever Listing 401\u2013450|date=May 31, 2009}}</ref> The album included songs now regarded as Van Halen classics, like \"[[Runnin' with the Devil]]\" and the guitar solo \"[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]\", which showcased Eddie's use of a technique known as [[Tapping|\"finger-tapping\"]]. The band toured for 9 months more, opening for [[Black Sabbath]] and establishing a reputation for their performances.<ref name=\"Monk, Noel memoir\">Monk, Noel memoir</ref> The band's chemistry was based on Eddie Van Halen's guitar technique and David Lee Roth's charisma. The band returned to the studio for 2 weeks, in late 1978, to record ''[[Van Halen II]]'', a 1979 [[LP record|LP]] similar in style to their debut. This record yielded the band's first hit single, \"[[Dance the Night Away (Van Halen song)|Dance the Night Away]]\", which peaked at 15 on BB Hot 100.\n\nOver the next four years, the band toured non stop, never taking more than 2 weeks to record an album. Their ''[[Women and Children First]]'' album was released in 1980, and further cemented Van Halen's platinum-selling status to Warner Bros. It yielded two hit singles [[And the Cradle Will Rock...]] and [[Everybody Wants Some!! (song)|Everybody Wants Some!!]]. For the first time, an amplified [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] was used to complement Ed's guitar.\n\n[[File:Vanhalen 1981.jpg|thumb|Van Halen in 1981]]\nIn 1981, during the recording of the ''[[Fair Warning (Van Halen album)|Fair Warning]]'' album, artistic tensions rose.{{clarify|What sort of tensions, and why?|date=October 2020}} Eddie's desire for darker, more complex songs in minor keys was at odds with Roth's pop tastes and style. Nonetheless, Roth and veteran Warner Bros rock producer Ted Templeman acquiesced to Eddie's wishes on this album. Doug Messenger recalls how Ed and (engineer) Don Landee rerecorded the [[Unchained (song)|Unchained]] solo hours after Ted \"stormed out of\" the studio. This darker album only reached platinum status after $250,000 of [[payola]] pushed it up nationwide from 400k copies.<ref name=\"Monk, Noel memoir\"/>\n\nPlanning to release a cover single, then take a  hiatus, Roth and Ed easily agreed upon a remake of the 1960s Roy Orbison classic [[Oh, Pretty Woman]], which peaked at 12 on BB Top 100. Pretty Woman's comical video helped its immediate success, but was also banned by MTV.  However, due to much pressure from Warner Bros. the hiatus was canceled and the ''[[Diver Down]]'' LP was squeezed out, again, within 2 weeks time.<ref name=\"Monk, Noel memoir\"/> Roth's preference for pop covers prevailed this time and with Ed's synthesizer and guitar riffs Diver Down charted much better. The band then earned a spot in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the highest-paid single appearance of a band: $1.5&nbsp;million for a 90-minute set at [[Steve Wozniak]]'s 1983 [[US Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gill |first1=Chris |title=Eddie Van Halen Revisits Van Halen's Landmark '1984' Album |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/eddie-van-halen-looks-back-van-halen-1984-album-5150-studios |website=Guitar World |access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref> A show that both Noel Monk and Doug Messenger considered artistically, a performance disaster, Roth being imbibed on cocaine to the point of forgetting lyrics.<ref name=\"Monk, Noel memoir\"/> Despite this return to form, Roth and Eddie's differences continued, and this caused friction with other band members.

Group members have given different reasons for the split, but all were firmly rooted in control of the band's sound, artistic direction, singles released and pace. Roth was concerned about Eddie playing music outside of Van Halen. Roth was also launching a successful solo career with two hit cover songs off his ''[[Crazy from the Heat]]'' EP, a remake of [[the Beach Boys]]' classic \"[[California Girls]]\" (#3 U.S.) and a pairing of the classic [[Al Jolson]] standard \"[[Just a Gigolo (song)|Just a Gigolo]]\" and \"[[I Ain't Got Nobody]]\"(#12 U.S.), which had previously been paired together by [[Louis Prima]]. Roth was also offered a $20-million film deal for a script titled ''Crazy from the Heat''. Roth hoped Van Halen would contribute the soundtrack; however, the film deal fell through when [[CBS Pictures]] was reorganized in 1986.\n\n===1985\u20131996: Sammy Hagar era===\n[[File:Sammy Hagar.jpg|alt=Hagar playing guitar|thumb|The introduction of Sammy Hagar (pictured in 2005) as vocalist continued the band's worldwide popularity.]]\nEddie invited [[Patty Smyth]] of [[Scandal (American band)|Scandal]] to replace Roth but she declined.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hillis |first1=Roger |title=Patty Smyth and Scandal returning to Dewey Beach |url=https://www.delawareonline.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/02/13/patty-smyth-and-scandal-returning-to-dewey-beach/5444265/ |website=[[Delaware Online]] |access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref> Eddie was then introduced to [[Sammy Hagar]] in 1985, via their mutual [[Ferrari]] mechanic. Hagar was the former frontman for the hard rock group [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]], and now a solo artist coming off a very successful year. His hit single \"[[I Can't Drive 55]]\" came from his 1984 album [[VOA (Sammy Hagar album)|''VOA'']], produced by [[Ted Templeman]] who had also produced Montrose's first album [[Montrose (album)|''Montrose'']], as well as all of Van Halen's albums up to that point. Hagar agreed to sing as well as play rhythm guitar.\n\n[[Daryl Hall]] was also offered the lead vocal position in 1985, but also declined. Hall verified, to Hagar, his musical guest in the May 2015 season premiere of ''[[Live from Daryl's House]]'' that indeed he was approached after a Hall & Oates concert.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Sammy Hagar |series=[[Live from Daryl's House]] |network=Palladia |date=May 15, 2015 |number=69 |minutes=33 minutes in |transcript=DARYL HALL JOINING VAN HALEN? |transcript-url=http://mikesdailyjukebox.com/daryl-hall-joining-van-halen/}}</ref>\n\nWhen Warner Brothers president Mo Ostin came to the band's [[5150 Studios]] to hear the band's progress, Hagar said, the band played \"[[Why Can't This Be Love]]\" live with Eddie on keyboards, after which Ostin proclaimed: \"I smell money.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Greene |first1=Andy |title=Van Halen's '5150': Sammy Hagar Looks Back |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/van-halens-5150-sammy-hagar-looks-back-97736/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=April 17, 2019 |date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 1986 Van Halen album ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' was a huge hit, becoming the band's first No. 1 album on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts, driven by the keyboard-dominated singles \"Why Can't This Be Love\" (#3 U.S.), \"[[Dreams (Van Halen song)|Dreams]]\", and \"[[Love Walks In]]\" (Top 30 U.S.). To further introduce the new era for the band, a new Van Halen logo was put on the cover. The new logo retained elements of the original, but now the lines extending from either side of 'VH' wrapped around and formed a ring.\n\nFollowing the release of the ''5150'' album, the \"[[5150 Tour]]\" was launched to support it across North America. Footage was released on VHS and DVD as ''[[Live Without a Net (Van Halen video)|Live Without a Net]]''. The band minimized the use of pre-Hagar Van Halen songs in the set,<ref>{{cite web |title=Van Halen: Sammy Hagar reflects on 5150 album anniversary |url=http://www.hennemusic.com/2019/03/van-halen-sammy-hagar-reflects-on-5150.html |website=Hennemusic.com |access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref> other than the band's best known classics. This was a trend that continued, with the expanding repertoire of Hagar-era songs slowly whittling away at the number of Roth-era songs on the set list.\n\n[[File:Vantallica.jpg|left|alt=Band members posing together|thumb|Van Halen and [[Metallica]] posing backstage in 1988.]]\nAll four studio albums produced during this period reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] pop music charts and 17 singles breached the top 12 of the mainstream rock tracks chart. During that era, a single taken from 1988's ''[[OU812]]'', \"[[When It's Love]]\", reached the Top Five, peaking at No. 5. In addition, Van Halen was nominated for two [[Grammy award]]s.

They recorded a live album and concert film at two 1992 F.U.C.K. tour shows in Fresno, California called ''[[Live: Right Here, Right Now]].''  During the F.U.C.K. and the live album supporting Live: Right Here Right Now tour, [[Night Ranger]]'s [[Alan Fitzgerald]] played keyboards offstage every night allowing Eddie to concentrate on guitar.

This led to conflicts with Hagar and the group's new manager, [[Ray Danniels]], (Ed Leffler's replacement and Alex Van Halen's former brother-in-law), even though it was Leffler who had renewed their contract with Warner Bros. Records and had added in the Best Of album option years before. Hagar was reluctant to work on a compilation album before a new album came out, but if the rest of the band and Danniels insisted on going forward with one at that time, his preference was that it should include only Roth-era songs, or as a second choice, that two volumes should be released, one of Roth-era songs and one of Hagar-era songs. During this same period, competing personal priorities and creative differences contributed to increasing interpersonal tensions within the band, particularly between Eddie and Hagar. The relationship between Hagar and Van Halen broke down.<ref name=\"GWHuff\"/>\n\n===1996: Temporary reunion with Roth===\nDavid Lee Roth called Eddie to discuss what tracks would be included on a planned Van Halen compilation (work on which had actually begun before Hagar's departure). They got along well, and Eddie invited him up to his house/studio. Shortly afterwards, Roth re-entered the studio with the band and producer [[Glen Ballard]]. Two songs from those sessions were added to the band's ''[[Best Of \u2013 Volume I (Van Halen album)|Best Of \u2013 Volume I]]'' album and released as singles to promote it.\n\nIn September, Van Halen was asked to present an award at the [[1996 MTV Video Music Awards]]. They agreed, and on September 4, 1996, the four original members of Van Halen made their first public appearance together in over eleven years. This helped to bring the compilation to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. However, unknown to Roth, Eddie and Alex were still auditioning other singers, including [[Mitch Malloy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/mitchmalloy.html|title=Mitch Malloy \u2013 Talks Van Halen|website=Melodicrock.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vhnd.com/2012/10/18/audio-mitch-malloys-audition-for-van-halen-1996/|title=Audio: Mitch Malloy's Audition for Van Halen (1996)|date=October 18, 2012|website=Van Halen News Desk}}</ref> Eddie, Alex and Anthony recorded several Van Halen songs with Mitch on lead vocals during his audition, two of which (Why Can't This Be Love and Panama) later leaked online. Malloy declined Eddie's invitation to join the band after the VMAs publicity stunt with Roth, of which he had no prior knowledge until it aired on TV. As a parting gift, Eddie gave Malloy an instrumental track to which Malloy later wrote lyrics to and released in 2015 with the title \"It's The Right Time\" (The guitar riff from that instrumental later reemerged in the sessions leading up to Van Halen's 1998 studio album [[Van Halen III]] in the song \"That's Why I Love You.\" The song was scrapped from the record in favor of \"Josephina.\")\n\nThe band's appearance on the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards fueled reunion speculation. But several weeks after the awards show, it was discovered that Roth was out of Van Halen again. Roth released a statement in which he apologized to the media and the fans, stating that he was an unwitting participant in a publicity stunt by Van Halen and manager Ray Danniels. The next day, Eddie and Alex released their own statement, claiming they had been completely honest with Roth and had never suggested he was guaranteed to be the next lead singer.<ref name=\"rothvh2\">Open letter from David Lee Roth about the band's appearance on the MTV Video Music Awards</ref>\n\nEddie later explained (in regard to the MTV Video Music Awards appearance) that he had initially been embarrassed by Roth's antics while on camera behind [[Beck]], who was giving an acceptance speech for the award that Van Halen had presented to him. Immediately following this, the band had been taken to a backstage press conference where press queries about a reunion tour were met with Eddie saying that he needed a hip replacement and would have to record an entire new studio album before any tour. In private Roth told Eddie to avoid talking about negative things like his hip and the two almost came to blows, thereby shattering any chance of a full-scale reunion.<ref>{{YouTube|MdRqx7bHrrM}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1996\u20132000: Gary Cherone era===\n[[File:Gary Cherone-Extreme-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright=0.7|Vocalist Gary Cherone (pictured in 2008) joined the band briefly in the late 1990s.]]\nVan Halen's next lead singer was [[Gary Cherone]], frontman of the then-defunct Boston-based band [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], a group which had enjoyed some popular success in the early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-25-boldest-career-moves-in-rock-history-150807/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017171646/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-25-boldest-career-moves-in-rock-history-20110318/van-halen-hire-gary-cherone-19691231|url-status=dead|title=25 Boldest Career Moves in Music|first1=Andy|last1=Greene|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 18, 2011|archive-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref> The result was the album ''[[Van Halen III]]''. Many songs were longer and more experimental than Van Halen's earlier work. It was a notable contrast from their previous material, with more focus on ballads than traditional rock songs (\"How Many Say I\", with Eddie on vocals). Sales were poor by the band's standards, only reaching a Gold certification, despite the album peaking at No. 4 on the U.S. charts. However, ''Van Halen III'' did produce the hit \"[[Without You (Van Halen song)|Without You]]\", and another album track, \"Fire in the Hole\", appeared on the ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' soundtrack. The album was followed by a tour. The ''III'' Tour saw Van Halen playing in new countries, including first ever visits to Australia and [[New Zealand]]. \"Without You\" acquired No. 1 place on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Charts in 1998, the 13th song of theirs to do so, and thus making them the band with the most Mainstream Rock No. 1s.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8265489/three-days-grace-most-mainstream-rock-number-ones-van-halen|title=Three Days Grace Ties Van Halen for Most No. 1s on Mainstream Rock Songs Chart|magazine=Billboard|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nShortly afterwards, Van Halen returned to the studio and in early 1999, they started work on a new album.

None of the material from these sessions has ever been released, and in fact the band released no new material until three new songs written and recorded with Hagar were included on the 2004 ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)|Best of Both Worlds]]'' compilation. Lyrics that Cherone had written for the ''Van Halen III'' follow up would be used in his next project with [[Tribe of Judah (band)|Tribe of Judah]].\n\nCherone later stated that he believed if he and the band had toured first and then recorded an album they might have creatively gelled more and the album would have turned out better.\n\nTouring with Cherone had proven disappointing in terms of attendance. Eddie later admitted that \"the powers that be\" ([[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]]) had forced his hand in parting with Cherone. Unlike with the previous two singers, there was reportedly no bad blood behind the breakup, and Cherone remained in contact and on good terms with Van Halen. As when Hagar left, speculation resumed on a Roth reunion.\n\n===1999\u20132003: Hiatus from public===\nEddie recovered from his hip surgery in November 1999, but from 2000 to early 2004 no official statements were made by Van Halen and no music was released. However, information about members past and present trickled in. The Van Halen brothers continued writing at 5150 Studios, Cherone recorded an album and toured with new band [[Tribe of Judah (band)|Tribe of Judah]]. One of the songs that Cherone had written for the scrapped second album with Van Halen, titled \"Left For Dead\", would see its lyrics set to a new musical arrangement with Tribe of Judah.\n\n[[File:Sammy Hagar and the Waboritas.jpg|alt=The band hugging onstage|thumb|left|After leaving Van Halen, Hagar has focused on his band the Waboritas as well as branching out into the [[Cabo Wabo]] nightclub, merchandise, and alcohol brands.]]\nResponding to speculation that he had been approached to replace Cherone, [[David Coverdale]] said, \"I called a mutual friend and said, 'Tell Eddie I had nothing to do with this.'

The recorded demos would be among the ones reworked into new songs on 2012's ''[[A Different Kind of Truth]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/van-halen-2000-roth-album/|title = Did van Halen Almost Finish a David Lee Roth Reunion LP in 2000?}}</ref> The band also tried to just schedule some concerts with Roth at a later date.<ref name=ant>[https://www.vhnd.com/2006/03/17/michael-anthony-breaks-his-silence/ Michael Anthony Breaks His Silence]</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2002, Roth and Hagar teamed up in the ''Song for Song, the Heavyweight Champs of Rock and Roll'' tour (also known as the 'Sans-Halen' or 'Sam & Dave' Tour). The tour, with both singers headlining, attracted media and audience fascination because it seemed more improbable than even a Van Halen tour with Roth or Hagar. It drew large crowds and featured no opening acts, Roth and Hagar alternating as the first act. Roth contrasted his personality with Hagar's: \"He's the kind of guy you go out with to split a bottle with a friend. I'm the kind of guy you go out with if you want to split your friend with a bottle.\" Anthony guested with Hagar's band, [[the Waboritas]], numerous times and sometimes even sang lead vocals. During performances, Hagar would tease Anthony by asking, \"Do the brothers know you're here?\" Anthony never played with Roth. Cherone appeared on occasion. Hagar released a live album (''Hallelujah''), featuring vocals by Anthony and Cherone, and a documentary DVD, ''Long Road to Cabo'', about touring with Roth. While the two singers promoted the tour and publicly claimed mutual respect, rumors of bitter acrimony and mutual loathing swirled. The allegations were later supported by backstage video, which showed the Roth and Hagar camps maintaining strict separation.\n\nNext, Hagar joined with [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Journey (band)|Journey]] guitarist Neal Schon to form a side project, Planet Us, with Michael Anthony and Deen Castronovo (also of Journey) on drums. The band recorded just two songs and played live a few times before dissolving when Hagar and Anthony rejoined Van Halen.\n\nOn July 4, 2004, Roth performed with one of the world's most popular orchestras, the [[Boston Pops]], at United States' annual ''Pops Goes the Fourth'' celebration in Boston. Hagar remained active, releasing five albums and creating his own merchandising brand ''Cabo Wabo'', which lends its name to the line of [[tequila]] he formerly owned,  as well as his franchise of cantinas. He reunited with [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]] in 2003 and 2005 for a few performances and maintained contact with Anthony, often playing with him. With Van Halen inactive, Anthony set up a website and worked on merchandising projects such as his signature [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] bass and range of hot sauces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madanthonycafe.com/ |title=Mad Anthony's Cafe |publisher=madanthonycafe.com |access-date=March 12, 2011}}</ref> He became involved with the annual music industry [[NAMM Show]].\n\n===2003\u20132005: Reunion with Hagar===\n[[Image:VanHalenwithHagar.jpg|thumb|right|Van Halen during their 2004 reunion period.

Eventually, Hagar decided to call Alex to spend a day together with him, the two got along and got interested in reuniting on stage.<ref name=ant/> In late March 2004, Van Halen and Hagar announced that Hagar would reunite with the band for a new compilation release and a summer concert tour of the U.S.\n\nIn July 2004, Van Halen released ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)|The Best of Both Worlds]]'', a double CD compilation featuring three new songs with Hagar: \"It's About Time\", \"Up for Breakfast\", and \"Learning to See\". These new songs were credited to Hagar/Van Halen/Van Halen, which was unusual since normally the entire lineup, which also included Michael Anthony, would be credited. However, the performance was credited to the entire band. Anthony later revealed in interviews that Eddie had in fact not wanted him to be a part of the reunion, with him only joining at Hagar's insistence. The new songs had already been recorded, with Eddie playing the bass parts himself instead, and Anthony only provided backing vocals for the three tracks.<ref name=\"roadrunnerrecords\">{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/michael-anthony-speaks-candidly-about-van-halen-s-past-and-future/ |title=MICHAEL ANTHONY Speaks Candidly About VAN HALEN's Past And Future |last=Harrell |first=John \"Shooter\" |publisher=blabbermouth.net |date=March 17, 2006 |access-date=December 17, 2013}}</ref> No songs with Cherone from ''Van Halen III'' were included. It was certified platinum in the US in August 2004.\n\n[[Van Halen Summer Tour 2004|The Summer 2004 tour]] grossed almost US$55&nbsp;million, and Pollstar listed Van Halen in the top 10 grossing tours of 2004. Professional reviews of the tour, however, proved to be mixed. On some shows, Eddie's son Wolfgang came onstage and played guitar with his father during \"316\", a song dedicated to his son, taking its name from his March 16 date of birth. During the later stages of the tour, stories of Eddie being drunk began to surface along with fan-shot video footage of poor playing. At the band's final show of the tour, in Tucson, Eddie smashed one of his guitars at the end of the show.\n\nAfter the tour, things broke down. At first Hagar stated he had yet to decide what he would be doing with Van Halen, although he was still an official member of the band. Soon after, however, both Hagar and Anthony admitted that Eddie had problems with alcohol during the tour that affected everyone involved.
