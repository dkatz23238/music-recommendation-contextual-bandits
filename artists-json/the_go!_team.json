Team''' are an English six-piece band from [[Brighton]], England. The band initially began as a solo project conceived by Ian Parton; however, after the unexpected success of The Go! Team's debut album, ''[[Thunder, Lightning, Strike]]'', Parton recruited band members to play for live performances and subsequent albums. Musically, the band combines [[indie rock]] and [[garage rock]] with a mixture of [[funk music|funk]] and [[Bollywood]] soundtracks, [[Double Dutch (jump rope)|double Dutch]] chants, old school [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and distorted guitars. Their songs are a mix of live instrumentation and [[sampling (music)|samples]] from various sources. The band's vocals also vary between performances: while live vocals are handled mostly by lead vocalist [[Ninja (British rapper)|Ninja]], vocals on record also feature sampled and guest voices.\n\n== History ==\n=== 2000\u20132004: Origins ===\nThe Go!

[...] It was getting really hard to keep it together; people were having kids, there were side projects going on, and honestly, we'd kind of done everything that we wanted to.

Despite this, Parton retained The Go! Team's name on the album: \"I started the band myself, and did the first album alone, so I felt like I had the right to keep calling it The Go! Team.\"<ref name=\"the-line-of-best-fit\" /> The album's sound was a departure from the previous two albums, which were more band-oriented and groove-based. Instead, Parton put a bigger emphasis on vocal melodies for the album: \"The original plan was to write a whole bunch of songs that I thought were melodically interesting - kind of curvy, kind of dense. From there, I was going to try to build the songs out of chords I'd taken from loads of different places; I'd get the G from a sixties psych record, or the B from an old funk track, or something. [...] To some extent, I've always worked that way, but I wanted to pursue that properly this time, and it actually turned out a lot more subtle than I thought it would. It's like a balance between everything I've always loved, musically.\"<ref name=\"the-line-of-best-fit\" /> The album features vocals from relatively unknown vocalists; Parton wanted to avoid high-profile guest appearances on the album, as opposed to the previous two albums, and put out open calls on the [[Drowned in Sound]] message board. ''The Scene Between'' was released through Memphis Industries on 24 March 2015.\n\nThe band went on tour to support the fourth album with a new band line-up. The line-up notably included the return of guitarist Sam Dook and lead vocalist Ninja. In an interview with [[The Line of Best Fit]], Parton expressed of Ninja's return, \"A live show without [Ninja] would be a completely different ball game, so I'm glad we've got her; I know she loves doing it.\"<ref name=\"the-line-of-best-fit\" /> The new line-up also included guitarist Cheryl Pinero, drummer Simone Odaranile, and multi-instrumentalist Angela \"Maki\" Won-Yin Mak.\n\nOn 11 October 2017, The Go!
