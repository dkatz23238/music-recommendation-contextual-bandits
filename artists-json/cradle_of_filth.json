The band's musical style evolved originally from [[black metal]] to a cleaner and more \"produced\" amalgam of [[gothic metal]], [[symphonic metal]] and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by [[Gothic literature]], [[poetry]], [[mythology]] and [[horror film]]s. The band consists of its founding member, vocalist [[Dani Filth]], drummer [[Martin Marthus \u0160karoupka|Martin 'Marthus' \u0160karoupka]], bassist Daniel Firth, guitarists Marek 'Ashok' \u0160merda and Donny Burbage, and keyboardist Zoe Marie Federoff.\n\nThe band has broken free from its original niche by courting mainstream publicity. This increased accessibility has brought coverage from the likes of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and [[MTV]], along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as [[Ozzfest]], [[Download Festival|Download]] and even the mainstream [[Sziget Festival]]. They have sometimes been perceived as [[Satanism|Satanic]] by casual observers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/cradle-of-filths-dani-filth-on-the-role-of-satanism-in-metal-6588563|title=Cradle of Filth's Dani Filth on the Role of Satanism in Metal|author=Lauren Wise|work=Phoenix New Times}}</ref> even though their outright lyrical references to Satanism are few and far between; their use of Satanic imagery has arguably always been more for [[Shock rock|shock]] value than any seriously held beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/cradle-of-filth-frontman-dani-filth-on-shock-value-in-music-its-so-blase-and-so-contrived|title=CRADLE OF FILTH Frontman DANI FILTH on Shock Value in Music \u2013 \"It's So Blas\u00e9 And So Contrived\"|work=bravewords.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Early years (1991\u20131996) ===\nCradle of Filth's first three years saw three demos (''Invoking the Unclean'', ''Orgiastic Pleasures Foul'' and ''[[Total Fucking Darkness]]'') recorded amidst the sort of rapid line-up fluctuations that have continued ever since, with the band having more than thirty musicians in its history. An album entitled ''Goetia'' was recorded prior to the third demo and set for release on Tombstone Records, but all tracks were wiped when Tombstone went out of business and the band could not afford to buy the recordings from the studio.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Lovecraft & Witch Hearts]] |others=Cradle of Filth |year=2002 |publisher=[[Music for Nations]] |last=Gregori |first=Damien}}</ref> The band eventually signed to Cacophonous Records, and their debut album, ''[[The Principle of Evil Made Flesh]]'', was Cacophonous's first release in 1994. A step-up in terms of production from the rehearsal quality of most of their demos, the album was still nevertheless a sparse and embryonic version of what was to come, with lead singer [[Dani Filth]]'s vocals in particular bearing little similarity to the style he was later to develop.

Subsequently re-worked with new band members for [[Music For Nations]] (see below), the embryonic Cacophonous version was eventually released as ''Dusk... and Her Embrace: The Original Sin'' in July 2016.\n\nThe band finally signed to Music for Nations in 1996 after only one more contractually obligated Cacophonous recording: the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[V Empire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein]]'', which, it has since been conceded, was hastily written as a Cacophonous escape-plan.<ref name=\"Rockdetector\" /> Despite the circumstances of its release however, its handful of tracks are staples of the band's live sets to this day, and \"Queen of Winter, Throned\" was listed among twenty-five \"essential extreme metal anthems\" in a 2006 issue of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine. The EP also marked [[Sarah Jezebel Deva]]'s debut with the band, replacing [[Andrea Haugen|Andrea Meyer]], Cradle's first female vocalist and self-styled \"satanic advisor\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Baddeley |first=Gavin |author-link=Gavin Baddeley |year=1994 |title=Lucifer Rising |publisher=Nemesis Publishing |page=211}}</ref> Deva appeared on every subsequent Cradle release and tour until 2010's ''[[Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa]]'', but was never considered a full band member, since she also performed with [[The Kovenant]], [[Therion (band)|Therion]] and [[Mortiis]], and fronted her own [[Angtoria]] project along with Cradle's former bass guitar player, [[Dave Pybus]].\n\n=== Music for Nations era (1996\u20132001) ===\nThe re-worked and re-recorded ''[[Dusk and Her Embrace|Dusk... and Her Embrace]]'' followed the same year: a critically acclaimed breakthrough album that greatly expanded the band's fan-base throughout Europe and the rest of the world.<ref name=\"AllMusic biography\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cradle-of-filth-mn0000779670 |title=Cradle of Filth \u2013 Music Biography, Credits and Discography : AllMusic |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[AllRovi]] |access-date=25 June 2013}}</ref> Cradle's inaugural album for [[Music for Nations]] set the tone for what was to follow.

A fully realised concept album based on the legend of the \"Blood Countess\" [[Elizabeth B\u00e1thory]], the album boasted the casting coup of [[Ingrid Pitt]] providing guest narration as the Countess; a role she first played in [[Hammer Film Productions]]' 1971 film ''[[Countess Dracula]]''. The album led to Cradle's US debut,<ref name=\"Knac.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=958 |title=knac.com \u2013 Features \u2013 Getting Filthy with Dani Filth |last=Atkinson |first=Peter |date=11 June 2002 |website=Knac.com |access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref> and Dani claimed it in 2003 as the Cradle album of which he was most proud, although he conceded dissatisfaction with its sound quality.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |journal=[[Metal Hammer]]|title=Cradle of Filth |date=March 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe following year the band continued primarily to tour, but did release the EP ''[[From the Cradle to Enslave]]'', accompanied by the band's first [[music video]], which formed the centrepiece of the [[DVD]] ''PanDaemonAeon''. Replete with graphic nudity and [[Graphic violence|gore]], the video was directed by [[Alex Chandon]], who would go on to produce further Cradle promo clips and DVD documentaries, as well as the full-length feature film ''[[Cradle of Fear]]''.\n\nThe band released their fourth studio album in the [[Autumn]] of 2000. ''[[Midian (album)|Midian]]'' was based around the [[Clive Barker]] novel ''[[Cabal (novella)|Cabal]]'' and its subsequent film adaptation ''[[Nightbreed]]''.<ref name=\"EMP1\">{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Owen |title=The Strange Case of Clive Barker's ''Nightbreed'' |journal=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=August 2012}}</ref> Like ''Cruelty and the Beast'', ''Midian'' featured a guest narrator, this time [[Doug Bradley]], who starred in ''Nightbreed'' but remains best known for playing [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] in the ''[[Hellraiser]]'' series. Bradley's line \"Oh, no tears please\" from the song \"[[Her Ghost in the Fog]]\" is a quote of Pinhead's from the first ''Hellraiser'' (\"No tears, please.

The video for \"Her Ghost in the Fog\" received heavy rotation on [[MTV2]] and other metal channels, and the track also found its way onto the soundtrack of the werewolf movie ''[[Ginger Snaps (film)|Ginger Snaps]]'' (it would also feature, much later, in the video game ''[[Br\u00fctal Legend]]'').\n\n=== Sony interlude (2001\u20132004) ===\nThe longest-ever interim period between full-length Cradle albums was nevertheless a busy time for the band. ''[[Bitter Suites to Succubi]]'' was released on the band's own Abracadaver label, and was a mixture of four new songs, re-recordings of three songs from ''The Principle of Evil Made Flesh'', two instrumental tracks and a cover of [[The Sisters of Mercy]]'s \"No Time to Cry\". Stylistically similar to ''Midian'', the collection was, at the time, unique among Cradle releases in that it featured exactly the same band members as its predecessor. Further stop-gap releases followed in the form of the \"[[greatest hits album|best of]]\" package ''[[Lovecraft & Witch Hearts]]'' and the live album, ''[[Live Bait for the Dead]]''. Finally, the band (principally Dani) also found time to appear in the horror film ''[[Cradle of Fear]]'' while they negotiated their first major-label signing with [[Sony Music]].\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = Everything in the band is a democracy decision..
