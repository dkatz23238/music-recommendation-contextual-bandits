During her childhood, she was featured in over 100 advertisements and had minor roles in television and theatre. She achieved mainstream success as Maddie Fitzpatrick in the [[Disney Channel]] teen sitcom ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'' (2005\u20132008). This success was heightened when she starred as [[Sharpay Evans]] in the ''[[High School Musical (franchise)|High School Musical]]'' [[High School Musical (franchise)|film series]] (2006\u20132008). The success of the films led to Tisdale's signing with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and subsequently releasing her debut studio album, ''[[Headstrong (Ashley Tisdale album)|Headstrong]]'' (2007), which was a commercial success, earning a gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Tisdale played the voice role of [[Candace Flynn]] in the Disney Channel animated series ''[[Phineas & Ferb]]'' (2007\u20132015).\n\nTisdale's second studio album, ''[[Guilty Pleasure (Ashley Tisdale album)|Guilty Pleasure]]'' (2009), was released to less commercial success than its predecessor. Tisdale would part ways with Warner Bros. Records following the release of the album. During this time, she began appearing in more films and returned to television with shows such as ''[[Hellcats]]'' (2010). Tisdale's production company Blondie Girl Productions, first formed in 2008, signed a multi-year production deal with [[Relativity Media]] in 2010; Tisdale would produce shows such as ''[[Miss Advised]]'' (2012) as part of the deal. Tisdale starred in the ''High School Musical'' spin-off film ''[[Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure]]'' (2011), also releasing a soundtrack to promote the film.\n\nIn 2013, Tisdale announced work on her third studio album, releasing the promotional single \"[[You're Always Here]]\", and starred in the horror comedy film ''[[Scary Movie 5]].'' She has continued to appear in television roles, joining the main cast of ''[[Clipped (TV series)|Clipped]]'' (2015). She also served as executive producer of the [[ABC Family]] television series ''[[Young & Hungry]]'' (2014\u20132018). In 2018, Tisdale returned to music with the release of the singles \"[[Voices in My Head (song)|Voices in My Head]]\" and \"[[Love Me & Let Me Go]]\". Her third studio album and first in a decade, ''[[Symptoms (Ashley Tisdale album)|Symptoms]]'', was released in 2019. Recently, Tisdale starred as Jenny Kenney in the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Carol's Second Act]]'' (2019\u20132020), and is currently serving as a panelist on the reality competition show [[The Masked Dancer (American TV series)|''The Masked Dancer'']].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/10/28/craig-robinson-to-host-the-masked-dancer-foxs-brand-new-celebrity-competition-show-featuring-panelists-ken-jeong-paula-abdul-brian-austin-green-and-ashley-tisdale-721210/20201028fox01/ |title=Craig Robinson to Host ''The Masked Dancer'', Fox's Brand-New Celebrity Competition Show, Featuring Panelists Ken Jeong, Paula Abdul, Brian Austin Green, and Ashley Tisdale |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |date=October 28, 2020 |access-date=October 28, 2020 |via=[[The Futon Critic]] |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20201117183043/http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/10/28/craig-robinson-to-host-the-masked-dancer-foxs-brand-new-celebrity-competition-show-featuring-panelists-ken-jeong-paula-abdul-brian-austin-green-and-ashley-tisdale-721210/20201028fox01/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===1985\u20132004: Childhood and career beginnings===\nAshley Michelle Tisdale was born on July 2, 1985 in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey]] to Lisa Morris and contractor Michael Tisdale.<ref name=\"interfaith\">{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaithfamily.com/arts_and_entertainment/popular_culture/Interfaith_Celebrities_Why_Pink_is_a_Mixed_Bag.shtml|title=Interfaith Celebrities: Why Pink is a Mixed Bag|work=Interfaith Family|last=Bloom|first=Nate|access-date=September 12, 2014}}</ref> Her father is [[Christians|Christian]] and her mother is [[Judaism|Jewish]]; she was raised with \"a little bit of both\" religions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Laurie |first=Heifetz |title=The Jewish Paparazzi-Funny, Tisdale doesn't sound Jewish! |work=American Jewish Life Magazine  |date=March\u2013April 2007 |url=http://www.ajlmagazine.com/content/032007/paparazzi.html |access-date=September 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908173451/http://www.ajlmagazine.com/content/032007/paparazzi.html |archive-date=September 8, 2014 }}</ref> Tisdale's elder sister [[Jennifer Tisdale|Jennifer]] is an actress and producer.<ref name=\"asylum\">{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title=Ashley Tisdale Inks Overall Deal With 'The Kennedys' Producer|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 22, 2014|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ashley-tisdale-inks-deal-kennedys-720392|access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref> She is also related to businessman [[Ron Popeil]] through her maternal grandfather Arnold Morris who was best known for being a pitchman for the [[Ginsu|Ginsu knife]].<ref name=\"interfaith\" /><ref name=\"arnold morris courant\">{{cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1997-09-19-9709190021-story.html|title=It's NewIt's ImprovedIt Slices, It Dices, Makes Julienne FriesStep Right Up!|work=The Hartford Courant|access-date=December 26, 2021}}</ref> At the age of three, Tisdale met her manager, Bill Perlman, at a New Jersey mall.
