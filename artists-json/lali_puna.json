The name of the band, meaning ''Valerie from Busan'', references this,  as ''Lali'' is a diminutive form of ''Valerie'', and ''Puna'' is a childish spelling of Busan (which is often transliterated ''Pusan''). She also lived ten years in [[Portugal]] before moving to Germany, and that's reflected in some of her songs, featuring lyrics in Portuguese.\n\nValerie played in an all-female band called [[L.B.Page]], until 1998, when she released a 7\" called ''Safe Side'' under the moniker ''Lali Puna''.  She was later joined by [[Markus Acher]], already lead singer and guitarist of [[The Notwist]] and [[Tied & Tickled Trio]] (with whom she was also romantically involved<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.exberliner.com/reviews/interview-valerie-trebeljahr-of-lali-puna/|title=Interview: Valerie Trebeljahr of Lali Puna|date=12 May 2010|website=Exberliner.com|accessdate=4 October 2020}}</ref> and also formed a side-project called [[John Yoko]]), Christoph Brandner, who played drums with Acher in the [[Tied & Tickled Trio]], and keyboardist Florian Zimmer.\n\nIn 2002 Florian Zimmer left for [[Hamburg]] to work on Iso68,<ref>{{cite web|website=Iso68.bandcamp.com|url=http://iso68.bandcamp.com//|title=Summer Of Seven 6/7}}</ref> being eventually replaced in 2003 with [[Christian Hei\u00df]] on the ''Left Handed'' EP.\n\nIn 2017, before the release of the ''Two Windows'' album, Markus Acher left the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://superworldindietunes.com/2017/09/08/valerie-from-lali-puna-talks-about-two-windows-our-lp-of-the-week/|title=Valerie from Lali Puna talks about \u201cTwo Windows\u201d, our LP of The Week|website=Superworldindietunes.com|date=September 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Studio albums ===\n* ''[[Tridecoder]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Scary World Theory]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Faking the Books]]''<ref>{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Sylvester|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4648-faking-the-books/|title=Lali Puna: Faking the Books|publisher=Pitchfork Media|date=April 25, 2004}}</ref> (2004)\n* ''[[Our Inventions]]''<ref>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Martins|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/lali-puna-our-inventions,40493/|title=Lali Puna: Our Inventions|publisher=[[The A.V.
