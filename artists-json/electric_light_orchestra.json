Thank you. --> an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1970 by songwriters and multi-instrumentalists [[Jeff Lynne]] and [[Roy Wood]] with drummer [[Bev Bevan]]. Their music is characterised by a fusion of [[pop music|pop]], [[classical music|classical]] [[arrangement]]s and [[Future#Science fiction|futuristic iconography]].<ref name=AllMusicBio/> After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's sole leader, arranging and producing every album while writing nearly all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan and keyboardist [[Richard Tandy]] were the group's only consistent members.\n\nELO was formed out of Lynne's and Wood's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. It derived as an offshoot of Wood's previous band, [[the Move]], of which Lynne and Bevan were also members. During the 1970s and 1980s, ELO released a string of top 10 albums and singles, including the band's most commercially successful album, the double album ''[[Out of the Blue (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Out of the Blue]]'' (1977). Two ELO albums reached the top of British charts: the [[disco]]-inspired ''[[Discovery (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Discovery]]'' (1979) and the [[science-fiction]]-themed [[concept album]] ''[[Time (ELO album)|Time]]'' (1981). In 1986 Lynne lost interest in the band and disbanded the group. Bevan responded by forming his own band, [[ELO Part II]], which later became [[The Orchestra (band)|the Orchestra]]. Apart from a brief reunion in the early 2000s, ELO remained largely inactive until 2014, when Lynne re-formed the band with Tandy as '''Jeff Lynne's ELO'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@eventticketsctr/jeff-lynnes-elo-announces-2019-headlining-tour-ecd484924785|title=Jeff Lynne's ELO Announces 2019 Headlining Tour|first=Event Tickets|last=Center|date=22 October 2018|website=Medium.com|access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring ELO's original 13-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music groups of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elo.biz/bandhistory.html |title=Electric Light Orchestra \u2013 Band History |website=Elo.biz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511065413/http://www.elo.biz/bandhistory.html |archive-date=11 May 2010|access-date=2 October 2011}}</ref> They collected 19 [[Canadian Recording Industry Association|CRIA]], 21 [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], and 38 [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] awards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/index.php |title=RIAA |publisher=RIAA |access-date=2 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004174019/http://www.riaa.com/index.php |archive-date=4 October 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/ |title=Home |website=Bpi.co.uk |access-date=2 February 2013}}</ref> From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated 27 top 40 songs on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and fifteen top 20 songs on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/electric-light-orchestra|title=Electric Light Orchestra Chart History|website=Billboard.com|access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/30488/elo/|title=E.L.O. &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref> The band also holds the record for having the most ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top 40 hits (20) without a number one single of any band in US chart history.<ref>Casey Kasem's American Top 40 from 15 March 1986</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jefflynnesongs.com/elousasingles/ |title=Electric Light Orchestra \u2013 The USA Singles |access-date=27 July 2007 |work=Jeff Lynne Song Database |author=Robert Porter}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|The band did reach No. 1 on the ''[[Radio & Records]]'' chart with \"[[Shine a Little Love]]\" in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/gghunt/charts/elo.htm|title=ELO|website=Wweb.uta.edu|access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/gghunt/charts/chart.html|title=Charts|website=Wweb.uta.edu|access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref>}} In 2017, the key members of ELO (Wood, Lynne, Bevan and Tandy) were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"rrhof17\">{{cite news|last1=Sisario|first1=Ben|title=Pearl Jam, Tupac Shakur and Joan Baez Will Join the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - NYTimes.com|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/arts/music/rock-roll-hall-fame-inductees-2017.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/elo|title=ELO|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== 1970\u20131973: Formation and early albums ===\n[[File:Electric_Light_Orchestra_publicity_photo_1973.png|left|thumb|[[The Move]]/Electric Light Orchestra in 1972]]\nIn 1968, [[Roy Wood]] \u2014 guitarist, vocalist and songwriter of [[the Move]] \u2014 had an idea to form a new band that would use [[violin]]s, [[cello]]s, string basses, horns and woodwinds to give their music a [[European classical music|classical]] sound, taking rock music in the direction to \"pick up where [[the Beatles]] left off\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=Picking up where the Beatles left off ...

[[Jeff Lynne]], frontman of fellow Birmingham group [[The Idle Race]], was excited by the concept. When [[Trevor Burton]] left the Move in February 1969, Lynne was asked by Wood to join, only to say no, as he was still focused on finding success with his band. But in January 1970, when [[Carl Wayne]] quit the band, Lynne accepted Wood's second invitation to join, on the condition that they focus their energy on the new project.\n\nOn 12 July 1970, when Wood added multiple cellos to a Lynne-penned song intended to be a Move B-side, the new concept became a reality and \"[[10538 Overture]]\" became the first Electric Light Orchestra song. The original plan was to end The Move following the release of the ''[[Looking On]]'' album at the end of 1970, crossing over to the new unit in the new year, but to help finance the fledgling band, one further Move album, ''[[Message from the Country]]'', was also recorded during the lengthy ELO recordings and released in mid-1971. The resulting debut album ''[[The Electric Light Orchestra (album)|The Electric Light Orchestra]]'' was released in December 1971. Only the trio of Wood, Lynne and Bevan played on all songs, with Bill Hunt supplying the French Horn parts and Steve Woolam playing violin. It was released in the United States in March 1972 as ''No Answer''. The name was chosen after a record company secretary had tried to ring the UK company to get the name of the album. They were unavailable so she left a note reading \"No answer\".<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/music/hidden/noanswer.asp Electric Light Orchestra's No Answer]. snopes.com. Retrieved 31 January 2011.</ref> \"10538 Overture\" became a UK top-ten hit. With both band's albums in the stores simultaneously, the Move and ELO both appeared on television during this period.\n\nELO's debut concert took place on 16 April 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in [[Croydon]], Surrey,<ref>{{cite book |last=Bevan |first=Bev |title=The Elo Story|year=1980|publisher=Mushroom Publishing|isbn=0907394000|page=174}}</ref> with a line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards/French horn), Andy Craig (cello), [[Mike Edwards (musician)|Mike Edwards]] (cello), [[Wilfred Gibson]] (violin), [[Hugh McDowell]] (cello), and [[Richard Tandy]] (bass). However, this line-up did not last for long.{{failed verification|date=May 2016}} First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the recordings for the band's second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form [[Wizzard]]. Both cited problems with their manager, [[Don Arden]],<ref name=WoodDeparture>{{cite news|title=Roy Wood talks about ELO |publisher=BBC |date=2007}}</ref> who Wood felt failed in his role, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where the cellos and violins could not be heard over the electric instruments.

Barcus Berry instrument [[Pickup (music technology)|pick-ups]], now sported by the band's string trio, allowed them to have proper amplification on stage for their instruments, which had previously been all but drowned out by the electrified instruments. The band released their second album ''[[ELO 2]]'' in early 1973, which produced their second UK top 10 and their first US chart single, an elaborate version of the [[Chuck Berry]] classic \"[[Roll Over Beethoven]]\" (which also incorporated the first movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s own [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]).<ref name=\"UK Charts\" /> ELO also made their first appearance on ''[[American Bandstand]]''. During the recording of the third album, Gibson was let go after a dispute over money, [[Mik Kaminski]] joined as violinist, and Walker left since touring was keeping him away from his family too much.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} Remaining cellist Edwards finished the cello parts for the album. The resulting album, ''[[On the Third Day]]'', was released in late 1973, with the American version featuring the popular single \"[[Showdown (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Showdown]]\". After leaving Wizzard, Hugh McDowell returned as the group's second cellist, also in late 1973, in time to appear on the ''[[On the Third Day]]'' cover in some regions, despite not having played on the album.\n\n===1974\u20131982: Global success and concept albums===\nFor the band's fourth album, ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]'', a concept album about a daydreamer, Lynne stopped multi-tracking strings and hired [[Louis Clark]] as string arranger with an orchestra and choir.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080605175932/http://www.eatonmusic.com/clark.html Eaton Music \u2013 Louis Clark].

The first single off the album, \"[[Can't Get It Out of My Head]]\", became their first US top 10 hit, and ''Eldorado, A Symphony'' became ELO's first [[music recording sales certification|gold album]]. Mike de Albuquerque departed the band during the recording sessions as he wished to spend more time with his family, and consequently much of the bass on the album was performed by Lynne.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Eldorado'', [[Kelly Groucutt]] was recruited as bassist and in early 1975, [[Melvyn Gale]] replaced Edwards on cello. The line-up stabilised as the band took to a decidedly more accessible sound. ELO had become successful in the US at this point and the group was a star attraction on the stadium and arena circuit, and appeared on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' more than any other band in that show's history with four appearances (in 1973, 1975, 1976 and 1977).\n\n''[[Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Face the Music]]'' was released in 1975, producing the hit singles \"[[Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Evil Woman]]\", their third UK top 10, and \"[[Strange Magic (song)|Strange Magic]]\".<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/> The opening instrumental \"[[Fire on High]]\", with its mix of strings and acoustic guitars, saw heavy exposure as the theme music for the American television programme ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'' in the mid-1970s.

During 1979, Jeff Lynne also turned down an invitation for ELO to headline the August 1979 [[Knebworth Festival]] concerts. That allowed [[Led Zeppelin]] the chance to headline instead.\n\nIn 1980, Jeff Lynne was asked to write for the soundtrack of the musical film ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' and provided half of the songs, with the other half written by [[John Farrar]] and performed by the film's star [[Olivia Newton-John]]. The film performed poorly at the box office, but the soundtrack did exceptionally well, eventually going [[music recording sales certification|double platinum]]. The album spawned hit singles from both Newton-John (\"[[Magic (Olivia Newton-John song)|Magic]]\", a No. 1 hit in the United States, and \"[[Suddenly (Olivia Newton-John and Cliff Richard song)|Suddenly]]\" with [[Cliff Richard]]) and ELO (\"[[I'm Alive (Electric Light Orchestra song)|I'm Alive]]\", which went gold, \"[[All Over the World (ELO song)|All Over the World]]\" and \"[[Don't Walk Away (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Don't Walk Away]]\").

With the string section now departed, synthesisers took a dominating role, as was the trend in the larger music scene of the time; although studio strings were present on some of the tracks conducted by Rainer Pietsch, the overall soundscape had a more electronic feel in keeping with the futuristic nature of the album. ''Time'' topped the UK charts for two weeks and was the last ELO studio album to be certified platinum in the United Kingdom until ''Alone in the Universe'' in 2015. Singles from the album included \"[[Hold On Tight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Hold On Tight]]\", \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\", \"[[The Way Life's Meant to Be]]\", \"[[Here Is the News]]\" and \"[[Ticket to the Moon]]\". However, the release of the single for \"[[Rain Is Falling]]\" in 1982 was the band's first single in the US to fail to reach the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top 200]] since 1975, and the release of \"The Way Life's Meant to Be\" similarly was their first single in the UK to fail to chart since 1976. The band embarked on [[Time Tour|their last world tour]] to promote the LP. For the tour, Kaminski returned to the line-up on violin, whilst Louis Clark (synthesizers) and [[David Scott-Morgan|Dave Morgan]] (guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, vocals) also joined the on stage lineup. Clark had previously handled string arrangements for the band.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\n===1983\u20131986: ''Secret Messages'', ''Balance of Power'', disbanding===\n[[File:Electric Light Orchestra (1986).jpg|thumb|right|ELO performing in 1986 (Jeff Lynne and Richard Tandy pictured)]]\n\nJeff Lynne wanted to follow ''Time'' with a double album, but CBS blocked his plan on the grounds that a double vinyl album would be too expensive in the oil crisis and not sell as well as a single record, so as a result, the new album was edited down from double album to a single disc and released as ''[[Secret Messages]]'' in 1983 (many of the out-takes were later released on ''[[Afterglow (box set)|Afterglow]]'' or as B-sides of singles). The album was a hit in the UK reaching the top 5; but its release was undermined by a string of bad news that there would be no tour to promote the LP. Lynne, discouraged by the dwindling crowds on the ''Time'' tour, CBS's order to cut ''Secret Messages'' down to one disc, and his falling out with manager Don Arden (he would eventually leave Arden and Jet by 1985), decided to end ELO in late 1983. Drummer Bevan moved on to play drums for [[Black Sabbath]] and bassist Groucutt, unhappy with no touring income that year, decided to sue Lynne and Jet Records in November 1983, eventually resulting in a settlement for the sum of \u00a3300,000 (equivalent to \u00a3994,300 in 2018). While ''Secret Messages'' debuted at number four in the United Kingdom, it subsequently performed poorly in the charts, with a lack of hit singles (though \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Is King]]\" was a sizeable hit in UK, the US and Australia) and a lukewarm media response.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThat same year, Lynne moved into production work, having already produced two tracks for [[Dave Edmunds]]' album ''[[Information (Dave Edmunds album)|Information]]'', and he would go on to produce six cuts from his next one, ''[[Riff Raff (album)|Riff Raff]]'', in 1984 and one cut on the [[Everly Brothers]] reunion album ''[[EB 84]]''. He also composed a track for former [[ABBA]] member [[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]]'s 1985 album ''[[Eyes of a Woman]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Jeff Lynne The Electric Light Orchestra |last=Van Der Kiste |first=John |year=2015 |publisher=Fonthill Media}}</ref>\n\nLynne and Tandy went on to record tracks for the 1984 ''[[Electric Dreams (soundtrack)|Electric Dreams]]'' soundtrack under Lynne's name; however, Lynne was contractually obliged to make one more ELO album. So Lynne, Bevan and Tandy returned to the studio in 1984 and 1985 as a three-piece (with Christian Schneider playing saxophone on some tracks and Lynne again doubling on bass in addition to his usual guitar in the absence of an official bass player) to record ''[[Balance of Power (album)|Balance of Power]]'', released early in 1986 after some delays. Though the single \"[[Calling America]]\" placed in the Top 30 in the United Kingdom (number 28) and Top 20 in the [[United States|States]], subsequent singles failed to chart. The album lacked actual classical strings, which were replaced once again by synthesizers, played by Tandy and Lynne. However, despite being a 3-piece, much of the album was made by Lynne alone, with Tandy and Bevan giving their additions later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/electric-light-orchestra-balance-of-power/ |title=35 Years Ago: Electric Light Orchestra Blow Apart On \"Balance of Power\" |last=Deriso |first=Nick |publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=February 17, 2021 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=March 29, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe band was then rejoined by Kaminski, Clark and Morgan, adding Martin Smith on bass guitar, and proceeded to perform a small number of live ELO performances in 1986, including shows in England and Germany along with US appearances on ''[[American Bandstand]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erY78_dwlH0| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/erY78_dwlH0| archive-date=2021-12-11 | url-status=live|title=ELO \u2013 Calling Am\u00e9rica AB 5 Jul 1986|date=31 May 2011|work=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'', then at [[Disneyland]] that summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn9s5RZFJgE| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/Dn9s5RZFJgE| archive-date=2021-12-11 | url-status=live|title=ELO \u2013 Disney's Summer Vacation Party (TV Show \u2013 1986)|date=17 October 2012|work=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> ELO performed at the [[Heart Beat 86]] charity concert organised by Bevan in the band's hometown of Birmingham on 15 March 1986;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTNzKdM99Jo| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/LTNzKdM99Jo| archive-date=2021-12-11 | url-status=live|title=Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) Concert at Birmingham NEC 1986 \u2013 Heartbeat 86|date=28 May 2013|work=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> a hint of Lynne's future was seen when [[George Harrison]] appeared onstage during the encore, joining in the all-star jam of \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\". ELO's last performance for several years occurred on 13 July 1986 in [[Stuttgart]], Germany playing as opening act to [[Rod Stewart]]. With Lynne no longer under contractual obligation to attend further scheduled performances, ELO effectively disbanded after that final show in Stuttgart in 1986, but there was no announcement made of it for the next two years, during which George Harrison's Lynne-produced album ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' and the pair's follow-up (with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Tom Petty]] as [[Traveling Wilburys]]) ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' were released.\n\n=== 1989\u20131999: ELO Part II ===\n{{Main|ELO Part II}}\n[[File:Electric Light Orchestra 3.jpg|right|thumb|ELO Part II in concert]]\nBev Bevan (under an agreement with Lynne, who co-owned the ELO name with him) continued on in 1989 as [[ELO Part II]], initially with no other former ELO members, but with ELO's main orchestra conductor, Louis Clark. Bevan also recruited [[Eric Troyer]], [[Pete Haycock]], and Neil Lockwood. ELO Part II released their debut album ''[[Electric Light Orchestra Part Two (album)|Electric Light Orchestra Part Two]]'' in May 1991. Mik Kaminski, Kelly Groucutt and Hugh McDowell, at the time working in a group called OrKestra, joined the group for their first tour in 1991. While McDowell did not stay, Groucutt and Kaminski became fully-fledged members. In 1994, after the departure of Haycock and Lockwood, the remaining five recorded ''[[Moment of Truth (ELO Part II album)|Moment of Truth]]'' with their newest member, [[Phil Bates]]. This lineup toured extensively up to 1999. Bevan retired from the lineup in 1999 and sold his share of the ELO name to Jeff Lynne in 2000, after Lynne had expressed his dismay that in certain areas the band were billed as 'ELO', rather than with '...Part II' added, suggesting it was the original outfit. After Bevan left, the band continued after they changed its name to [[The Orchestra (band)|The Orchestra]]. In 2001 The Orchestra released their debut album ''[[No Rewind]]''.\n\n===2000\u20132001: Reformation===\nLynne's comeback with ELO began in 2000 with the release of a retrospective box set, ''[[Flashback (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Flashback]]'', containing three CDs of remastered tracks and a handful of out-takes and unfinished works, most notably a new version of ELO's only UK number one hit \"[[Xanadu (Olivia Newton-John and Electric Light Orchestra song)|Xanadu]]\". In 2001 ''[[Zoom (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Zoom]],'' ELO's first album since 1986, was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/zoom-mw0000110819/releases|title=Zoom|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref> Though billed and marketed as an ELO album, the only returning member other than Lynne was Tandy, who performed on one track. Guest musicians included former [[The Beatles|Beatles]] [[Ringo Starr]] and [[George Harrison]]. Upon completion of the album, Lynne reformed the band with completely new members, including his then-girlfriend [[Rosie Vela]] (who had released her own album, ''[[Zazu (album)|Zazu]]'', in 1986) and announced that ELO would tour again. Former ELO member Tandy rejoined the band a short time afterwards for two television live performances: ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'' and a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] concert shot at [[CBS Television City]], later titled ''[[Zoom Tour Live]]'' and released on DVD. Besides Lynne, Tandy and Vela, the new live ELO lineup included [[Gregg Bissonette]] (drums, backing vocals), [[Matt Bissonette (musician)|Matt Bissonette]] (bass guitar, backing vocals), [[Marc Mann]] (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals), Peggy Baldwin (cello), and Sarah O'Brien (cello).
