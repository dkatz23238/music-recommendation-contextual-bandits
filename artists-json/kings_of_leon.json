The band is composed of brothers Caleb, Nathan and Jared Followill, and their cousin Matthew Followill.\n\nThe band's early music was a blend of [[Southern rock]] and [[garage rock]] with [[blues]] influences, but it has evolved throughout the years to include a variety of genres and a more [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[arena rock]] sound. Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine [[UK Singles Chart|Top 40 singles]], two [[BRIT Awards]] in 2008, and all three of the band's albums at the time peaked in the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Their third album, ''[[Because of the Times]]'', reached No. 1.\n\nAfter the release of ''[[Only by the Night]]'' in September 2008, the band achieved chart success in the United States. The singles \"[[Sex on Fire]]\", \"[[Use Somebody]]\", and \"[[Notion (Kings of Leon song)|Notion]]\" all peaked at number one on the [[Alternative Songs|Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. The album was their first [[List of music recording sales certifications|platinum]]-selling album in the United States, and the best-selling album of 2008 in [[Australia]], being certified platinum nine times. The band's fifth album, ''[[Come Around Sundown]]'', was released on October 18, 2010. Their sixth album, ''[[Mechanical Bull (album)|Mechanical Bull]]'', was released on September 24, 2013.

The group has 12 [[Grammy Award]] nominations, including 4 wins.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years: before 2002===\nThe three Followill brothers (Matthew is their cousin) grew up in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Tennessee]] with their father, Ivan Leon Followill, a [[United Pentecostal Church International|United Pentecostal Church]] preacher, and their mother, Betty-Ann. Nathan was born in Oklahoma, and Jared and Caleb were born in and around [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee. Jared attended [[Mount Juliet High School]], while Matthew was born and raised in Mississippi. According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, \"While Ivan preached at churches and tent revivals throughout Oklahoma and the Deep South, his boys attended services and were occasionally enlisted to \"bang on some drums\". They were either [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] by their mother, or enrolled in small [[parochial school]]s at this time. Except for a five-year period when they settled in [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], Tennessee, the Followills' childhoods were spent driving through the southern United States in a purple 1988 [[Oldsmobile]], camping for a week or two wherever Ivan was scheduled to preach.<ref name=Stonesr>{{cite magazine | title = Kings of Leon: Biography | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/kingsofleon/biography | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070328231944/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/kingsofleon/biography | url-status = dead | archive-date = March 28, 2007 | author = Stones, Rolling | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] | access-date = 2009-08-07 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the boys' father resigned from preaching and their parents divorced in 1997, Nathan and Caleb relocated to outside [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and originally embraced country music. While there, they met songwriter [[Angelo Petraglia]], who helped the siblings hone their songwriting skills and introduced them to the musical influences of [[Thin Lizzy]],<ref>Carbery, Genevieve.

Jared, who had briefly attended public school, was more influenced by the music of the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[the Velvet Underground]]. When he and their cousin Matthew also moved to Nashville in 1999, Kings of Leon was formed. They named the band after their grandfather Leon, who died in January 2014.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/20/entertainment/la-et-kings-of-leon-20110820 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Mary | last1=McNamara | title=Television review: 'Talihina Sky: The Story of Kings of Leon' | date=August 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Signing and first EP: 2002\u20132003===\nBy 2002, Nathan and Caleb had received interest from a number of music labels and eventually signed with [[RCA Records]], which initially insisted on putting a band together for the two of them. In an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', however, Nathan outlined how they told RCA, \"We don't want to be [[Evan and Jaron]]. We're going to buy our little brother a bass, he's a freshman in high school. Caleb will teach himself the guitar, Matthew played guitar when he was 10 and I'll play the drums. They said, 'All right, we'll come down in one month and see you guys.'\" Later in the interview Caleb admitted to the brothers \"kidnapping\" their cousin Matthew from his hometown in [[Mississippi]] for him to join the band. They told his mother that he was only going to be staying for a week but never allowed him to return home. \"We locked ourselves in the basement with an ounce of [[marijuana]] and literally spent a month down there. My mom would bring us food down,\" added Nathan. \"And at the end of that month the label people came and we had 'Molly's Chambers,' 'California Waiting,' 'Wicker Chair,' and 'Holy Roller Novocaine.'\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6e7tlhHmP0C&q=We're%20going%20to%20buy%20our%20little%20brother%20a%20bass%2C%20he's%20a%20freshman%20in%20high%20school.%20Caleb%20will%20teach%20himself%20the%20guitar.&pg=PP1 |author=Waddel, Ray |year=2009 |title=Kings of the Road: After Conquering the U.K. and Europe, Kings of Leon are Finally Getting Their Due at Home |publisher=Billboard |access-date=2010-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe band's first record, an [[Extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[Holy Roller Novocaine]]'', was released on February 18, 2003. At this stage, Jared was only 16 years old and had not yet learned to play the bass. The release of ''Holy Roller Novocaine'' gave the Kings of Leon a significant amount of exposure, receiving a 4/5 star rating from ''Rolling Stone'' magazine. All of the songs released on the EP were co-written by Angelo Petraglia, who also produced the record, and four of the five songs would later be released on ''[[Youth and Young Manhood]]''. The versions of \"[[Wasted Time (Kings of Leon song)|Wasted Time]]\" and \"[[California Waiting]]\" on the EP differ from their album versions, however, with the first having a more tense [[guitar riff|riff]] and different vocal style than the same track off ''Youth and Young Manhood'', the second being recorded in a rush to finish the EP. The EP also contains the song \"Wicker Chair\", while a track called \"Andrea\" was discarded before its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Kings+of+Leon/+wiki/diff?&a=19&b=20 |title=Kings of Leon's Biography \u2013 Listen free and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2008-11-21 |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> In addition, three songs from ''Holy Roller Novocaine'' were used in the [[Farrelly brothers]] film ''[[Stuck on You (film)|Stuck on You]]'' with [[Matt Damon]] and [[Greg Kinnear]]: \"California Waiting,\" \"Molly's Chambers\" and \"Holy Roller Novocaine.\"\n\n===First albums and critical recognition: 2003\u20132006===\nThe Followills' debut album, ''[[Youth and Young Manhood]]'', was released in the UK in July 2003 and in the United States that August.

The album became a sensation in the UK and Ireland, where ''[[NME]]'' declared it \"one of the best debut albums of the last 10 years\" and ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the band as \"the kind of authentic, hairy rebels [[the Rolling Stones]] longed to be\". The album still failed to make any significant impact in the US, where reviews were generally lukewarm and the modern rock audience was generally uninterested. In the United States, ''Youth and Young Manhood'' sold only 100,000 copies, compared with the 750,000 copies it moved abroad.\n\nThe band's second album, ''[[Aha Shake Heartbreak]]'', was released in the UK in October 2004 and in the United States in February 2005.
