The band consists of [[Alex Greenwald]] (vocals, rhythm guitar), Darren Robinson (lead guitar), [[Sam Farrar]] (bass guitar) and [[Jeff Conrad]] (drums). The band is best known for its track \"[[California (Phantom Planet song)|California]]\", which became the theme song for the [[Television program|TV series]] ''[[The O.C.]]''. The band featured actor [[Jason Schwartzman]] on drums until 2003.\n\nOn November 25, 2008, the band announced in a blog entry on their website that they are going on \"hiatus, and will not be playing any more live shows or making any new records, indefinitely.\"<ref name=\"The Full Break Up Story\">{{Cite news\n| url = http://moviemiguel.blogspot.com/2008/11/phantom-planet-break-up.html|website=Moviemiguel.blogspot.com\n| title = Phantom Planet No More? | date = 2008-11-25\n}}</ref> They played their last pre-hiatus show on December 12, 2008, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe band reunited in 2019, announcing that their hiatus was over.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1994\u20131998)===\nPhantom Planet was named in 1994 after a 1961 [[B-movie]] called ''[[The Phantom Planet]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/phantom-planet-mn0000844440/biography|title=Phantom Planet {{!}} Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> They played their first show in 1994 at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in Hollywood, California.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Most of their friends could not attend because they were still in high school.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Two of the songs they played are featured on the bonus material of the ''Chicago, Chicagogoing, Chicagogone'' DVD. Among the songs performed were \"My Friend Liz's Dad\" (misprinted as \"My Friend Liz Is Dead\" on the DVD) and a cover of the Beastie Boys 1994 song \"Sabotage\".\n\nWhile still in their teens, the group played frequently in and around the Hollywood area, finally catching the eye of [[Geffen Records]] executives. Phantom Planet signed with Geffen in 1997 and released their first effort, ''[[Phantom Planet Is Missing]]'' in [[1998 in music|1998]]. ''Phantom Planet is Missing'' showed musical similarities to the popular band [[Weezer]], with influences ranging from [[The Beach Boys]] to [[Electric Light Orchestra]], but the album failed to gain any significant ground with either critics or fans. However, as some group members started to make appearances on both the small and large screen and the group pressed on, Phantom Planet gradually built momentum.\n\n===''The Guest'' (2002\u20132003)===\nShortly thereafter Geffen Records folded into [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] as part of a major record industry merger, and within a few years Phantom Planet had signed with [[Epic Records]]. Charlotte Froom, the daughter of famed producer [[Mitchell Froom]]\u2014who had worked with [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Paul McCartney]]\u2014caught the band's show just at the time when the group was looking for a producer to record their second effort. Excited by the group's music, the young Froom approached her father to produce the group, and after meeting with Phantom Planet, he agreed. Froom also brought in engineer [[Tchad Blake]], who had worked with Pearl Jam and Sheryl Crow, to work on the record.\n\n''[[The Guest (album)|The Guest]]'' was released in 2002 and showcased a solid dose of poppy vocals, solid melodies, and sing-along choruses, which helped anchor Phantom Planet as a formidable indie outfit. The group's presence was also solidified by its commitment to touring. The group toured for almost 18 months both as a headliner and an opening act, and in late 2002 the band got the opportunity to open for one of their collective idols, the legendary Elvis Costello. ''The Guest'' got an extra boost when the record's notable power ballad \"[[California (Phantom Planet song)|California]]\" was chosen as the theme song for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]]'s hit TV series ''[[The O.C.]]'' As a result, the record was reissued in late 2003 with bonus tracks and a new cover.\n\n===''Phantom Planet'' (2004)===\nThe band's [[Phantom Planet (album)|eponymous third album]] in 2004 marked a change in both the band's sound and lineup. Ditching their radio-friendly pop rock, the band moved towards a [[garage rock]] sound. Lead singer [[Alex Greenwald]] stated that he wants the band to continue to change its sound. \"I love rock 'n' roll music,\" Greenwald said. \"I especially loved bands, like The Beatles, that changed with every single record they made. That's been our plan from the get-go. We want our records to be like experiments. We want to have fun with the music. People can hear when you're not having fun. They discover you're bored and you're boring.\"<ref>September 10, 2004.

He was replaced by [[Jeff Conrad]], who helped record the remainder of the album. ''Phantom Planet'' was released to mixed reviews from critics. Shortly after the album's release, guitarist [[Jacques Brautbar]] left the band to pursue a career in photography. The band performed \"Big Brat\", the album's first single, on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.\n\n===''Raise the Dead'' (2007\u20132008)===\nEarly on in the recording process Phantom Planet's contract with Epic Records expired, which left them searching for a new record label. Soon after this, they signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]].\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Phantom Planet posted a bulletin on their Myspace page that stated that the album will officially be finished by the January 24, and that the official release date would be April 15, 2008. Fueled By Ramen re-released a teaser trailer and stated that the first single from the album will be a reworking of \"[[Do the Panic]]\".\n\nIn an interview with RaggedMag, Greenwald stated that \"all bands are kind of their own cult, you know, but we want to take it to a new level. We really like the show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', and even though it's totally fiction, there's this air of mystery that's lacking in a lot entertainment these days. I really like mystery in things, and what a little bit of enigma brings out of people and their imaginations... a band is about community, and within itself it is a brotherhood; it's companionship. But a band can't be anything without the people to love it. Our goal will be to recruit and befriend as many people as possible with our message.\"\n\nWhen describing the new record, Greenwald said that \"the next record is a concept record. If [[The Beatles]] had ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper's]]'' and [[The Rolling Stones]] had ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'', we have our 'Leader.' We're concocting it, but at the same time we're following it.\"\n\nThe album, titled ''[[Raise the Dead]]'', was released as scheduled on April 15, 2008.\n\n===Indefinite hiatus (2008)===\nOn November 25, 2008, Phantom Planet announced in a blog entry on their website that they would be playing their last show December 12, 2008 at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. The band issued a statement about their hiatus:\n{{cquote|This could be the most difficult piece of news we have ever had to post. Sadly, Phantom Planet will be playing our last show, December 12, at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, the same venue that we played our very first live all ages gig, back in 1994. We have had an amazing time playing together for 15 years, but we have officially decided to go on hiatus, and will not be playing any more live shows or making any new records, indefinitely. There is so much more to write, but at this time, we just want to say thank you, to everyone, for their support, friendship, inspiration, attendance, and love.\n\n-alex, darren, jeff and sam.<ref name=\"The Full Break Up Story\"/><ref>[http://phantomplanet.com/2008/11/25/phantom-planet/ Phantom Planet break up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815144638/http://phantomplanet.com/2008/11/25/phantom-planet/ |date=2009-08-15 }}</ref>}}\n\nThey played their last show on December 12, 2008, in Los Angeles. Alex mentioned numerous times during their last show that the band was, in fact, going on a hiatus, not breaking up.\n\nGuitarist Darren Robinson posted this message on his personal Myspace page telling fans that they are not broken up:\n\"We have NOT broken up. We are on an indefinite hiatus. That means we don't know when we'll regroup. But we are NOT broken up. I swear to you it's not just a polite way of saying we have broken up. Got it?\"\n\n===First reunion (2011\u20132013)===\nOn November 4, 2011, an official Phantom Planet reunion Twitter account was created which stated they would be reuniting in 2012. Since then, they have held their first practice in 3 years. In late January 2012, Phantom Planet announced their first reunion show, June 13, at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. On January 31, they announced the addition of a second Troubadour show to be played June 14, 2012. Former member of the band, Jacques Brautbar, joined them for songs at the June 13 show.\n\nIn August 2013, the band, under Alex Greenwald & Phriends, performed a new song titled Balisong, which ended up being on Greenwald's solo album and later released in 2019 as a single by the full band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DczZle0U5MA |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/DczZle0U5MA |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|title=Alex Greenwald & Phriends (Members of Phantom Planet) perform Balisong at The Kennedy Administration|last=Headquarters Music|date=8 August 2013|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> This performance did not have bassist Sam Farrar because he was touring with Maroon 5.
