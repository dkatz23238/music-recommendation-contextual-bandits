The band is composed of lead vocalist and lead guitarist [[Jim Adkins]], rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton, bassist Rick Burch, and drummer Zach Lind. They have released ten [[studio album]]s, the last nine featuring the current lineup.\n\nThe four-piece's commercial breakthrough came with the release of several singles from their album ''[[Bleed American]]'' (2001), four of which charted within the top 20 positions of the [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks|Alternative Songs chart]], with \"[[The Middle (Jimmy Eat World song)|The Middle]]\" reaching No. 1. Their follow-up album, ''[[Futures (album)|Futures]]'' (2004), featured the No. 1 song \"[[Pain (Jimmy Eat World song)|Pain]]\".\n\nThe [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certified ''Bleed American'' platinum and ''Futures'' gold, rewarding the two albums for selling over 1.5 million records between them. The band's sixth LP, ''[[Chase This Light]]'' (2007), became their highest-charting album and peaked at No. 5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band released their tenth album, ''[[Surviving (album)|Surviving]]'', in October 2019.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and name (1993\u20131995)===\nJimmy Eat World formed in 1993 in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Frontman Jim Adkins and drummer Zach Lind, who had been friends since preschool, joined guitarist Tom Linton and bassist Mitch Porter to try their hand at music. They originally formed with a [[punk rock]] sound and first released a demo tape in 1993, followed by a debut [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''One, Two, Three, Four'' in 1994. Their debut [[Jimmy Eat World (1994 album)|self-titled album]] (1994) was released with Linton singing most of the lead vocals on the album. Within the span of a couple of years, the band recorded and released three singles and a full-length album on local label Wooden Blue Records.\n\nDuring their formative period the band claimed as influences such [[pop-punk]] bands as [[Mr. T Experience]], Radon, and [[Horace Pinker]].<ref>''Book Your Own Fuckin' Life #3: Do-It-Yourself Resource Guide.'' San Francisco, CA: Maximum Rocknroll, 1994; pg. 3.</ref>\n\nThe band's name came from a crayon drawing made after an incident between Linton's younger brothers, Jim and Ed Linton, who fought frequently. Jim usually won, but Ed sought revenge by drawing a picture of Jim shoving the Earth into his mouth; the picture bore the caption \"Jimmy eat world\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chrisblackburn.com/articles/0001.php |title=Interview: Tom Linton of Jimmy Eat World |publisher=ChrisBlackburn.com |last=Blackburn |first=Chris |date=April 1999 |access-date=March 3, 2007 }} Linton: \"Actually, it's a picture that my little brother drew ... probably five years ago. My brother Jim beat up my younger brother Ed, and Jim ran into his room and locked his door, and Ed drew this picture that said \"Jimmy Eat World\", and it was a picture of him eating the world.\"</ref>\n\n===''Static Prevails'' (1996\u20131998)===\n{{main|Static Prevails}}\nEventually, spurred by bands such as [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], the band began to experiment with slower tempos and more varied song structures. As they began writing songs and touring in the [[independent music|indie]] scene, the band encountered like-minded bands, such as [[Christie Front Drive]], [[Sense Field]], and [[Seven Storey Mountain]], that were working on similar sounds.\n\nThe band began to attract increasing attention following the release of numerous recordings and concurrent touring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Five Minutes with Fame: Jimmy Eat World|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6406_jimmy-eat-world-interview-video/|work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc|access-date=August 20, 2012|author=Rock Hall|date=September 2, 2010}}</ref> In response to this self-generated exposure, [[Capitol Records]] offered the band a deal in mid-1995, following the interest of Craig Aaronson, the A&R director of the label.<ref name=\"Taxi\">{{cite web|title=Loren Israel: Director of A&R Capitol Records|url=http://www.taxi.com/transmitter/0311/director-ar-capitol-records.html|work=Taxi Transmitter|publisher=Taxi|access-date=August 20, 2012|author=Doug Minnick|year=2012}}</ref> Just prior to signing with Capitol, bass player Mitch Porter parted ways with the band and was replaced by Linton's friend Rick Burch.\n\nAfter a brief scouting for producers, the band joined up with [[Drive Like Jehu]] drummer [[Mark Trombino]] and [[Wes Kidd]] from [[Triple Fast Action]] to record its major-label debut ''[[Static Prevails]]'' that featured their first singles \"Call It in the Air\" and \"Rockstar\". In the ensuing years, the band's agreement with Capitol permitted the release of singles on independent labels, including split 7-inch singles with Christie Front Drive (Wooden Blue Records, 1995), [[Jejune]] (Big Wheel Recreation, 1997), Blueprint (Abridged Records, 1996), Sense Field, and [[Mineral (band)|Mineral]].\n\n===''Clarity'' (1999\u20132000)===\n{{main|Clarity (Jimmy Eat World album)}}\nFrom late 1998 to early 1999, the band recorded their next album ''[[Clarity (Jimmy Eat World album)|Clarity]]'' at two studios, Sound City Studios ([[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]], [[California]]) and Clear Lake Audio ([[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]], California). The tracks were mixed at One on One Studios ([[Los Angeles]], California) and Music Grinder Studios, and were mastered at Bernie Grundman Mastering ([[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], California). Both the band and Trombino produced the album, with the latter also responsible for the album's mixing duties. ''Clarity'' marks the start of Adkins's primary role as lead vocalist and, instead, Linton's focus was guitar work. ''Clarity'' was also released on vinyl through the now-defunct American independent record label Big Wheel Recreation.<ref name=oxfordmusiconline>{{cite web |url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/13867 |title=Jimmy Eat World |last1=Larkin |first1=Colin |website=Oxford Music Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe third album contained the single \"Lucky Denver Mint\" and a radio [[remix]] of the song was featured in the film ''[[Never Been Kissed]]''; the song garnered a [[cult following]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The album's closing song \"Goodbye Sky Harbor\" is based on the [[John Irving]] novel ''[[A Prayer for Owen Meany]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Prayer for Owen Meany (2)|url=http://pclit.pbworks.com/w/page/15141744/A%20Prayer%20for%20Owen%20Meany%20(2)|work=Literary Allusions in Popular Music|publisher=PBWorks|access-date=April 5, 2013|author=Sydney|year=2010}}</ref> Overlooked upon its release, Clarity has since amassed [[Clarity (Jimmy Eat World album)#Reception and legacy|cult status and critical acclaim]].\n\n===''Bleed American'' (2001\u20132003)===\n{{main|Bleed American}}\nThe band decided to record its next album without the help of a label, supporting itself with touring and by compiling its previously released singles into ''[[Singles (Jimmy Eat World album)|Singles]]'', which was released on indie label [[Big Wheel Recreation]]. The band also took on day jobs, saving as much as they could to spend on the sessions.<ref>Mehr, Bob. \"In between tightly budgeted tours, Linton worked construction, while Adkins sold art supplies, Burch shipped auto parts and Lind shuttled customers at a car dealership.\"</ref> They worked for a third time with Trombino, who agreed to defer payment until after the album's release in order to keep costs down.<ref>{{cite web |last=Seigel |first=Steven |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/gbase/Music/Content?oid=62054 |title=Jimmy Eat World |work=Tucson Weekly |date=October 21, 2004 }}</ref> Some of the drum tracks were recorded at Cherokee, and then the band moved to Doug Messenger's harddrive analog and digital in North Hollywood, where five weeks of tracking completed the recording phase. Trombino then mixed the record at Extasy in Hollywood.\n\nThe finished album was titled ''[[Bleed American]]''. Joining with Gersh's new management company, GAS Entertainment, the band scouted for a new label. The band eventually signed with [[DreamWorks Records|DreamWorks]]. The completed album was released in July 2001, which included a vinyl edition through the now-defunct [[Grand Royal]] label, founded by the band the [[Beastie Boys]] in 1993.<ref name=oxfordmusiconline /><ref>{{cite news|title=For a Record Label Founded by the Beastie Boys, the End Is Less Than Grand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/business/for-a-record-label-founded-by-the-beastie-boys-the-end-is-less-than-grand.html|access-date=April 21, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 19, 2004|author=Bill Werde}}</ref> The title track (titled \"Salt Sweat Sugar\" in the UK) was the lead single.

CFOX.  October 30, 2007. Adkins: \"It was something that we decided around September 14 that we wanted to do. ...

Once again, the band joined up with Trombino, but the collaboration was short-lived. As the sessions began, the band decided that they did not have enough material for a cohesive album. The band's desire to spend more time writing songs conflicted with Trombino's availability, as he already had other projects on his schedule.<ref name=\"henderson\">{{cite web |last=Henderson |first=Steve |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=258417 |title=Jimmy Eat World&nbsp;\u2014 07.27.07 |work=Absolute Punk |date=August 10, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nInstead, the band brought in producer [[Gil Norton]], well known for his work with the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and the [[Foo Fighters]].

Having already toured the U.S. alone and with [[Taking Back Sunday]], the band signed on to tour in 2005 with [[Green Day]].
