A few months after Wells' death, the band had a meeting with Max and said that they wanted to fire their manager Gloria Bujnowski, who was Max's wife and Dana's mother, and find new management. Their reasoning was that Bujnowski was giving preferential treatment to Max while neglecting the rest of the band. Max, who was still coming to terms with the death of Wells, felt betrayed by his bandmates for wanting to get rid of Bujnowski and abruptly quit the band.<ref name=\"AllMusic Bio\"/> Max Cavalera's final performance with Sepultura was at [[Brixton Academy]] in England on December 16, 1996.<ref>Rock Sound Issue 15576:pg 56.
