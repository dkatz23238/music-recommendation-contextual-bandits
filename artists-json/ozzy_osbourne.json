The first Ozzfest was held in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], on 25 October 1996 and in [[Devore, San Bernardino, California|Devore, California]], on 26 October. Ozzfest was an instant hit with metal fans, helping many up-and-coming groups who were featured there to broad exposure and commercial success. Some acts shared the bill with a reformed Black Sabbath during the 1997&nbsp;Ozzfest tour, beginning in [[West Palm Beach]], [[Florida]]. Osbourne reunited with the original members of Sabbath in 1997 and has performed periodically with them since.\n\nSince its beginning, five million people have attended Ozzfest which has grossed over US$100&nbsp;million. The festival helped promote many new hard rock and heavy metal acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Ozzfest helped Osbourne to become the first hard rock and heavy metal star to hit $50&nbsp;million in merchandise sales. In 2005, Osbourne and his wife Sharon starred in an MTV competition reality show entitled \"[[Battle for Ozzfest]]\". A number of yet unsigned bands send one member to compete in a challenge to win a spot on the 2005&nbsp;Ozzfest and a possible recording contract. Shortly after [[Ozzfest]] 2005, Osbourne announced that he will no longer headline Ozzfest. Although he announced his retirement from Ozzfest, Osbourne came back headlining the tour. In 2006 Osbourne closed the event for just over half the concerts, leaving the others to be closed by [[System of a Down]]. He also played the closing act for the second stage at [[Shoreline Amphitheatre]] in [[Mountain View, California]] on 1 July as well as [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randalls Island]], New York on 29 July. After the concert in [[Bristol, Virginia]], Osbourne announced he would return for another year of Ozzfest in 2007.\n\nTickets for the [[Ozzfest#2007: FreeFest|2007 tour]] were offered to fans free of charge, which led to some controversy. In 2008, Ozzfest was reduced to a one-day event in [[Dallas]], where Osbourne played, along with [[Metallica]] and [[King Diamond]]. In 2010, Osbourne appeared as the headliner closing the show after opening acts Halford and [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]. The tour, though small (only six US venues and one UK venue were played), generated rave reviews.<ref>{{cite web| work = Live Review | publisher = Artist Direct | url = http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,7352663,00.html |title= OZZfest 2010, San Bernardino \u2013 Ozzy Osbourne, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Devildriver, Black Label Society, Halford |date=16 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Trager |publisher=Hard rock haven |url=http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2010/ozzfest-2010/ |title=Ozzfest 2010 |date=9 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107035819/http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2010/ozzfest-2010/ |archive-date=7 January 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = Metal army | url = http://www.metal-army.com/?p=12252 | work = Live review | title = Ozz Fest 2010 Part II | date = 17 September 2010 | access-date = 22 January 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090910/http://www.metal-army.com/?p=12252 | archive-date = 2 April 2015 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ozzfest.com/index.php?page=news&n_id=567 | work =OZZfest | type = review | title = Ozzy Launches European Tour Leg |date= 2 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Ozzy on tour in Japan.jpg|thumb|upright|Osbourne on tour in Japan in 1999]]\n''[[Down to Earth (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Down to Earth]]'', Osbourne's first album of new studio material in six years, was released on 16 October 2001.

On 20 January 2019, Osbourne commemorated the 37th anniversary of the bat incident by offering an 'Ozzy Plush Bat' toy \"with detachable head\" for sale on his personal web-store.

The song deals with the dangers of alcohol misuse. McCollum's suicide led to allegations that Osbourne promoted suicide in his songs. Despite knowing McCollum had clinical depression, his parents sued Osbourne (''McCollum v. CBS'')<ref>Listed at FindLaw.com: 202 Cal.App.3d 989, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/ca/calapp3d/year/1988_7.html McCollum v. CBS, Inc.], 12 July 1988. No. B025565</ref> for their son's death, saying the lyrics in the song, \"Where to hide, suicide is the only way out. Don't you know what it's really about?\" convinced McCollum to commit suicide. The family's lawyer suggested that Osbourne should be criminally charged for encouraging a young person to commit suicide, but the courts ruled in Osbourne's favour, saying there was no connection between the song and McCollum's suicide. Osbourne was sued for the same reason in 1991 (''Waller v. Osbourne''), by the parents of Michael Waller, for $9&nbsp;million, but the courts once again ruled in Osbourne's favour.<ref>{{cite book| last = Nuzum| first = Eric| title = Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America| publisher = HarperCollins| year = 2001| location = New York City| pages = [https://archive.org/details/parentaladvisory00nuzu/page/57 57\u201358]| isbn = 978-0-688-16772-1| title-link = Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America}}</ref>\n\nIn lawsuits filed in 2000 and 2002 which were dismissed by the courts in 2003, former band members Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake, and [[Phil Soussan]] stated that Osbourne was delinquent in paying them [[Royalty payment|royalties]] and had denied them due credit on albums they played on.<ref>Cosmic Debris Magazine [http://www.cosmik.com/aa-august02/daisley.html Bob Daisley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121225021/http://www.cosmik.com/aa-august02/daisley.html |date=21 November 2013 }}.
