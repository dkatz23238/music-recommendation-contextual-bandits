Former members Matt Tong and [[Gordon Moakes]] left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as [[electronica]] and [[house music]]. The band was formed at the 1999 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]] by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in ''[[NME]]'' magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Steve Lamacq]] and [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]]'s lead singer, [[Alex Kapranos]], a copy of their demo \"[[She's Hearing Voices]]\".\n\nIn February 2005, the band released their debut album ''[[Silent Alarm]]''. It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 [[PLUG Awards]] and ''NME'' Album of the year which both honour [[indie music]]. That year, the record was also certified [[platinum record|platinum]] in Britain. The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album, ''[[A Weekend in the City]]'', which reached a peak of number two in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and number twelve in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In August 2008, Bloc Party released their third studio record, ''[[Intimacy (Bloc Party album)|Intimacy]]'' which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the ''Billboard'' 200. The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on [[side project]]s. They reunited in September 2011, and shortly thereafter released their fourth album, ''[[Four (Bloc Party album)|Four]]'', which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three. In 2013, Bloc Party released their third EP titled ''[[The Nextwave Sessions]]'' in August; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects. The band's fifth studio album, ''[[Hymns (Bloc Party album)|Hymns]]'', the first to involve Harris and Bartle, was released on 29 January 2016. Their sixth studio album ''[[Alpha Games]]'' was released on 29 April 2022. Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/50-massively-depressing-facts-about-music-1434249 |title=50 most depressing facts about music |work=[[NME]] |date=4 May 2012 |access-date=10 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and rising popularity (1999\u20132004)===\nRussell Lissack and Kele Okereke first met in 1998 in London.
