Brandy generally contains 35\u201360% [[alcohol by volume]] (70\u2013120 [[alcohol proof|US proof]]) and is typically consumed as an [[Ap\u00e9ritif and digestif|after-dinner digestif]]. Some brandies are aged in [[barrel|wooden casks]]. Others are coloured with [[caramel colouring]] to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are [[Cognac]] and [[Armagnac]] from [[South West France (wine region)|southwestern France]].<ref name=\"eb\" /><ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/brandy |title=Brandy |work=BBC |access-date=22 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, the term ''brandy'' also denotes liquors obtained from the distillation of [[pomace]] (yielding [[pomace brandy]]), or mash or wine of any other fruit ([[fruit brandy]]).<ref name=kirk>{{cite book|title=Kirk-Othmer Food and Feed Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f--1V1ftgtsC&pg=PA151 |page=151 |isbn=9780470174487 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |date=2007-12-14 }}</ref><ref name=eb>{{Britannica|77749}}</ref> These products are also called ''[[eau de vie]]'' (which translates to \"water of life\").\n\n==History==\nThe origins of brandy are tied to the development of [[distilled beverage|distillation]].

Canoemen and guards on the African side of the trade were generally paid in brandy. By the late 17th century [[rum]] had replaced brandy as the exchange alcohol of choice in the triangle trade.<ref name=\"Standage 2006\" >{{cite book |last1=Standage |first1=Tom |title=A History of the World in 6 Glasses |date=2006 |publisher=Walker Publishing Company |location=New York, New York |isbn=9780802715524 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780802715524 }}</ref>\n\nInitially, wine was distilled as a [[Food preservation|preservation]] method and as a way to make it easier for merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in [[aging barrel|wooden casks]], the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit.<ref name=eb/> In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.\n\nAs described in the 1728 edition of ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', the following method was used to distill brandy:<ref name=\"cyclo\">{{1728|title=Brandy}}</ref>\n<blockquote>A [[alembic|cucurbit]] was filled half full of the liquor from which brandy was to be drawn and then raised with a little fire until about one-sixth part was distilled, or until that which falls into the receiver was entirely flammable. This liquor, distilled only once, was called ''spirit of wine'' or ''brandy''. Purified by another distillation (or several more), this was then called ''spirit of wine rectified''. The second distillation was made in [a] ''[[bain-marie|balneo mariae]]'' and in a glass cucurbit, and the liquor was distilled to about one half the quantity. This was further rectified as long as the operator thought necessary to produce brandy.</blockquote>\n\nTo shorten these several distillations, which were long and troublesome, a chemical instrument was invented that reduced them to a single distillation. To test the purity of the rectified spirit of wine, a portion was ignited. If the entire contents were consumed by a fire without leaving any impurities behind, then the liquor was good. Another, better test involved putting a little [[gunpowder]] in the bottom of the spirit. If the gunpowder could ignite after the spirit was consumed by fire, then the liquor was good.<ref name=\"cyclo\"/>\n\nAs most brandies have been distilled from grapes, the regions of the world producing excellent brandies have roughly paralleled those areas producing grapes for viniculture. At the end of the 19th century, the western European markets, including by extension their overseas empires, were dominated by French and Spanish brandies and eastern Europe was dominated by brandies from the [[Black Sea Region|Black Sea region]], including [[Bulgaria]], the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In 1884, [[David Sarajishvili]] [[Sarajishvili|founded his brandy factory]] in Tbilisi, Georgia, a crossroads for Turkish, Central Asian, and Persian trade routes and a part of the Russian Empire at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iwinetc.com/news/sarajishvili-brandy-made-georgia/ |title=Sarajishvili Brandy Made in Georgia |publisher=International Wine Tourism Conference |date=5 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\nExcept for a few major producers, brandy production and consumption tend to have a regional character and thus production methods significantly vary. Wine brandy is produced from a variety of grape cultivars. A special selection of cultivars, providing distinct aroma and character, is used for high-quality brandies, while cheaper ones are made from whichever wine is available.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Food Fermentations |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKDNAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA250 |chapter=5.2. Brandy |pages=249\u2013252 |editor=Charles W. Bamforth, Robert E. Ward |year=2014 |isbn=9780199742707}}</ref>\n\nBrandy is made from so-called [[base wine]], which significantly differs from regular table wines. It is made from early grapes in order to achieve higher acid concentration and lower sugar levels. Base wine generally contains smaller amounts (up to 20&nbsp;mg/L) of [[sulphur]] than regular wines, as it creates undesired [[copper(II) sulfate]] in reaction with copper in the [[pot still]]s. The yeast sediment produced during the fermentation may or may not be kept in the wine, depending on the brandy style.<ref name=Oxford/>\n\nBrandy is distilled from the base wine in two phases. In the first, large part of water and solids is removed from the base, obtaining so-called \"low wine\", basically a concentrated wine with 28\u201330% ABV. In the second stage, low wine is distilled into brandy. The liquid exits the pot still in three phases, referred to as the \"heads\", \"heart\" and \"tails\" respectively. The first part, the \"head,\" has an alcohol concentration of about 83% (166 US proof) and an unpleasant odour. The weak portion on the end, \"tail\", is discarded along with the head, and they are generally mixed with another batch of low wine, thereby entering the distillation cycle again. The middle heart fraction, richest in aromas and flavours, is preserved for later maturation.<ref name=Oxford/>\n\nDistillation does not simply enhance the alcohol content of wine. The heat under which the product is distilled and the material of the still (usually copper) cause chemical reactions to take place during distillation. This leads to the formation of numerous new [[volatile organic compound|volatile]] aroma components, changes in relative amounts of aroma components in the wine, and the [[hydrolysis]] of components such as esters.\n\nBrandy is usually produced in [[pot still]]s ([[batch distillation]]), but the [[column still]] can also be used for [[continuous distillation]]. Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced.<ref name=Oxford/> [[Cognac]] and [[South African brandy]] are examples of brandy produced in batches<ref name=Oxford/> while many American brandies use [[fractional distillation]] in column stills.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Aging===\nAfter distillation, the unaged brandy is placed into [[oak barrel]]s to mature. Usually, brandies with a natural golden or brown colour are aged in [[oak]] [[aging barrel|casks]] (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, particularly those from Spain, are aged using the [[solera]] system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.<ref name=Oxford/>\n\n==Consumption==\n===Serving===\nBrandy is traditionally served at room temperature ([[straight up (bartending) |neat]]) from a [[snifter]], a [[wine glass]] or a [[beer glassware#Tulip glass|tulip glass]]. When drunk at room temperature, it is often slightly warmed by holding the glass cupped in the palm or by gentle heating. Excessive heating of brandy may cause the alcohol vapour to become too strong, causing its aroma to become overpowering. Brandy-drinkers who like their brandy warmed may ask for the glass to be heated before the brandy is poured.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/1998/03/14/feat_side1.html |title=Cognac Q&A |work=Forbes magazine |date=14 March 1998 |author=Charles Dubow }}</ref>\n\nBrandy may be added to other beverages to make several popular [[cocktail]]s; these include the [[Brandy Sour (Cyprus) |Brandy Sour]], the [[Brandy Alexander]], the [[Sidecar (cocktail) |Sidecar]], the [[Brandy Daisy]], and the [[Old fashioned (cocktail) |Brandy Old Fashioned]].\n\n[[Anglo-Indian people | Anglo-Indian]] usage has \"brandy-pawnee\" (brandy with water).<ref>\n{{oed | brandy-pawnee}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n |editor-last1         = Barr\u00e8re\n |editor-first1        = Albert\n |editor-last2         = Leland\n |editor-first2        = Charles Godfrey\n |editor-link2         = Charles Godfrey Leland\n |title                = A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon & Cant: Embracing English, American, and Anglo-Indian Slang, Pidgin English, Tinkers' Jargon and Other Irregular Phraseology\n |year = 1889\n |url                  = https://books.google.com/books?id=2QkE5uJaN1QC\n |volume               = 1\n |publisher            = Ballantyne Press\n |publication-date     = 1889\n |page                 = 176\n |access-date          = 4 May 2022\n |quote                = Brandy pawnee (Anglo-Indian and English gypsy), brandy and water.

Colour, texture and finish are most resembling those of their French and Spanish counterparts. Most popular brands are Vecchia Romagna, Stravecchio Branca and Stock 84. Northern Italy has also been noted since the Middle Ages for another type of wine spirit, [[Grappa]], which is generally colourless but has some top-shelf varieties called ''barrique'' which are aged in oak casks and achieve the same caramel colour as regular brandies. There is a vast production of Stravecchios and Grappas in Italy, with more than 600 large, medium or small distilleries in operation. [[Ticino]], in Italian speaking [[Switzerland]], is also allowed to produce pomace brandy under the name of Grappa.\n\n==Labelling of grades==\nBrandy has a traditional age grading system, although its use is unregulated outside of [[Cognac]] and [[Armagnac]]. These indicators can usually be found on the label near the brand name:\n\n* '''V.S.''' (\"very special\") or \u272f\u272f\u272f (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.<ref name=\"BNIC etiquette\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bnic.fr/cognac/_en/2_cognac/index.aspx?page=etiquette |title=All about Cognac \u2013 Reading a label |access-date=9 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223223212/http://www.bnic.fr/cognac/_en/2_cognac/index.aspx?page=etiquette |archive-date=23 December 2016 |url-status=dead |website=Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac }}</ref>\n* '''V.S.O.P.'''
