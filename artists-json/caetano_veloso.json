Soon after that, Veloso won a music contest and was signed to his first label. He became one of the founders of [[Tropic\u00e1lia|Tropicalismo]] with a group of several other musicians and artists\u2014including his sister [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]]\u2014in the same period. However, the Brazilian military dictatorship viewed Veloso's music and political action as threatening, and he was arrested, along with fellow musician [[Gilberto Gil]], in 1969. The two eventually were exiled from Brazil and went to London where they lived for two years. In 1972, Veloso moved back to his home country and once again began recording and performing.

His childhood was influenced greatly by artistic endeavors: he was interested in both literature and filmmaking as a child, but focused mainly on music. The musical style of [[bossa nova]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], one of its most prominent exponents, were major influences on Veloso's music as he grew up.<ref name=manning>{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Manning |title=The Life of Caetano Veloso |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/veloso/biography.html |work=[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|Online NewsHour]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |access-date=March 22, 2008 }}</ref> Veloso was 17&nbsp;years old when he first heard Gilberto, whom he describes as his \"supreme master\".<ref name=gross>{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Gross |author-link=Terry Gross |author2=Veloso, Caetano |title=Brazilian Songwriter Caetano Veloso |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=873042 |format=radio |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=December 10, 2002 |access-date=May 16, 2008 }}</ref> He recognizes Gilberto's contribution to Brazilian music as new\u2014\"illuminating\" the tradition of Brazilian music and paving the way for future innovation.<ref name=gross/> Veloso moved to the Bahian port city of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] as a teenager, the city in which Gilberto lived, and a center of [[Afro-Brazilian]] culture and music.<ref>Wald (2007), p. 118.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Veloso moved again to [[Rio de Janeiro]], with his sister [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]], also a musician. Shortly after the move, Veloso won a [[lyrics]] contest for his composition \"Um Dia\" and was signed to [[Philips Records]].<ref name=amg/> On October 21, 1967, Veloso won fourth prize and gained a standing ovation at the third annual Brazil Popular Music Festival with his song \"Alegria, Alegria\". on which he was backed by [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] group Beat Boys; along with the performance of his friend [[Gilberto Gil]], who was backed by psychedelic band [[Os Mutantes]], this marked the first time that rock bands had performed at the festival. During this period, Veloso, Beth\u00e2nia, [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Tom Z\u00e9]], and [[Os Mutantes]] developed \"[[Tropicalia|Tropicalismo]]\", which fused Brazilian pop with [[rock and roll]] and [[avant-garde]] music. Veloso describes the movement as a wish to be different - not \"defensive\" like the right-wing [[History of Brazil (1964\u20131985)|Brazilian military government]], which vehemently opposed the movement. Although Gil and Veloso's performances at the 1967 MBP Festival were rapturously received, within a year, Tropicalismo had become a deeply divisive issue among Brazil's youth audience, with Marxist-influenced college students of the Brazilian left wing condemning Tropicalismo, because they believed it commercialized Brazilian traditional music by incorporating musical influence from other cultures, specifically the United States.<ref name=gross/>\n\nThe musical manifesto of the Tropicalist movement was the landmark collaborative LP ''[[Tropic\u00e1lia: ou Panis et Circencis]]'' (\"Tropicalia: or Bread and Circuses\"), issued in mid-1968, which brought together the talents of Veloso, [[Os Mutantes]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Tom Z\u00e9]] and [[Gal Costa]], with arrangements by avant-garde composer-arranger [[Rogerio Duprat]] (who had studied with [[Pierre Boulez]]) and lyrical contributions from poet [[Torquato Neto]]. The album's group cover photograph depicted the collective holding a variety of objects and images, in a deliberate reference to the cover of The Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.\n[[File:Caetano Veloso no III Festival da M\u00fasica Popular.tif|thumb|Caetano Veloso at the III Popular Music Festival, 1967. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil]].]]\nThe tensions between the ''Tropicalistas'' and the student left peaked in September 1968 with Veloso's now-legendary performances at the third annual International Song Festival, held at the Catholic University in Rio, where the audience included a large contingent of students who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalistas. When Veloso (backed by Os Mutantes) performed in the first round of the Festival's song competition on September 12, he was initially greeted with enthusiastic applause, but the situation soon turned ugly. Dressed in a shiny green plastic suit, festooned with electrical wires and necklaces strung with animal teeth, Veloso provoked the students with his lurid costume, his sensual body movements and his startling new psychedelic music, and the performers were soon being bombarded with loud insults, jeers and boos from the students, who became even more incensed when American pop singer John Dandurand made a surprise appearance on stage during the song.\n\nThe ideological conflict climaxed three days later on September 15 when Veloso returned for the second round of the competition, performing a specially-written new song entitled \"\u00c9 Proibido Proibir\" (\"It is Forbidden to Forbid\"). The leftist students began hissing and booing as soon as Veloso's name was announced, and when he began his performance, his overtly sexual stage moves and the experimental music of Os Mutantes again provoked a wild reaction \u2013 the students began booing so loudly that the performers could barely be heard, and a section of the crowd then stood up and turned their backs to the stage, prompting Os Mutantes to turn their backs on the audience. As the performance continued, the students pelted the stage with fruit, vegetables, eggs, paper balls and anything else that came to hand. Veloso then stopped singing and launched into an impassioned monologue, in which he excoriated the students for their conservatism. After being joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support, Veloso finished his diatribe by telling the students \"...if you are the same in politics as you are in aesthetics, we\u2019re done for!\" and declaring he would no longer compete in music festivals. He then deliberately finished the song out of tune, angrily shouted \"Enough!\" and walked off arm-in-arm with Gil and Os Mutantes. A studio version of the song was later released as a single, and the closing section of the tumultuous live performance featuring Veloso's speech, was issued as the single's B-side.<ref>Victoria Langland, \"Il est Interdit d\u2019Interdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil\", ''Estudios Interdisciplinarios de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006).</ref> [103] Even though Tropicalismo was controversial among traditional critics, it introduced to [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]] new elements for making music with an eclectic style.<ref name=schnabel>{{cite book |last=Schnabel |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Schnabel |title=Rhythm Planet: The Great World Music Makers |url=https://archive.org/details/rhythmplanetgrea00schn |url-access=registration |year=1998 |publisher=Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-7893-0238-1}}</ref>\n\nVeloso studied philosophy at the [[Universidade Federal da Bahia]],<ref name=manning/> which influenced both his artistic expression and viewpoint on life.

Veloso and Gil were both arrested in February 1969 and held in prison for three months, followed by a further four months under house arrest; they were eventually released on condition that they leave the country, and spent the next few years in [[exile]].

In an interview Veloso stated that he did not like to \"lie to his own intelligence\" by believing in God.<ref name=paulopes/> In a separate interview Veloso generated controversy when he said that Brazil would be better off if most people in the country were to become irreligious or atheist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Caetano Veloso sobre o ate\u00edsmo|publisher=Di\u00e1rio de uns ateus|url=http://www.diariodeunsateus.net/2009/12/13/caetano-veloso-sobre-o-ateismo/|date=13 December 2009|access-date=7 March 2019|language=pt}}</ref> Despite this, two of Veloso's sons have become members of the neo-Pentecostal [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], with Veloso attending his children's baptism, stating that \"what is good for them is good for me.\"<ref name=paulopes>{{Cite web|title=Caetano Veloso, ateu famoso|url=https://www.paulopes.com.br/2012/01/caetano-veloso-ateu-famoso.html#.XIFox7gnYdU|date=5 January 2012|access-date=7 March 2019|language=pt|website=Paulopes.com.br}}</ref>\n\nIn 2022 Veloso talked about his [[bisexuality]] in a show commemorating his 80th birthday.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Caetano Veloso abre jogo sobre bissexualidade: \"Uns caras\" |url=https://natelinha.uol.com.br/famosos/2022/08/08/caetano-veloso-abre-jogo-sobre-bissexualidade-uns-caras-185690.php |archive-date=2022-08-08 |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=NaTelinha |language=pt-br}}</ref>\n\n==Musical style==\nVeloso's home, Bahia, has had a decisive role in his music. He praises Bahia for its importance in Brazil's colonial period\u2014when the Portuguese first came\u2014as well as for Bahia's contribution to Brazilian music.  He has cited among his musical influences [[Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues]], [[Cole Porter]], the [[Rolling Stones]] 1969 tour, and above all, [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]].\n\nVeloso says that he is unable to make a comparison between his musical style in the 1960s, at the height of Tropic\u00e1lia, and his current work. He does note, however, that he has been able to accomplish music of a higher quality later in his career; that he is \"better at everything.\"<ref name=gross/>\n\n==Discography==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n*1967: ''[[Domingo (Caetano Veloso & Gal Costa album)|Domingo]]''\n*1968: ''[[Caetano Veloso (1968 album)|Caetano Veloso]]''\n*1968: ''[[Tropic\u00e1lia: ou Panis et Circenses]]''\n*1968: ''Veloso, Gil e Beth\u00e2nia''\n*1969: ''[[Caetano Veloso (1969 album)|Caetano Veloso]]''\n*1971: ''[[Caetano Veloso (1971 album)|Caetano Veloso]]''\n*1972: ''[[Transa (album)|Transa]]''\n*1972: ''[[Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Azul]]''\n*1975: ''[[Qualquer Coisa]]''\n*1975: ''[[J\u00f3ia (album)|J\u00f3ia]]''\n*1977: ''[[Caetano... muitos carnavais...]]''\n*1977: ''[[Bicho (album)|Bicho]]''\n*1978: ''[[Muito (dentro da estrela azulada)|Muito]]''\n*1979: ''[[Cinema Transcendental]]''\n*1981: ''[[Outras Palavras]]''\n*1981: ''[[Brasil (1981 album)|Brasil]]'' ([[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]] album featuring Caetano Veloso, [[Gilberto Gil]] and [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]])\n*1982: ''[[Cores, Nomes]]''\n*1983: ''[[Uns (album)|Uns]]''\n*1984: ''Vel\u00f4''\n*1986: ''Caetano Veloso''\n*1987: ''Caetano''\n*1989: ''[[Estrangeiro]]''\n*1991: ''[[Circulad\u00f4]]''\n*1993: ''[[Tropic\u00e1lia 2]]'' (with Gilberto Gil)\n*1994: ''Fina Estampa''\n*1998: ''[[Livro]]''\n*2000: ''Noites do Norte''\n*2002: ''Eu N\u00e3o Pe\u00e7o Desculpa'' (with [[Jorge Mautner]])\n*2004: ''A Foreign Sound''\n*2005: ''Onqot\u00f4''\n*2006: ''[[C\u00ea]]''\n*2008: ''Caetano Veloso e Roberto Carlos \u2013 e a M\u00fasica de Tom Jobim''\n*2009: ''[[Zii e Zie]]''\n*2012: ''[[Abra\u00e7a\u00e7o]]''\n*2021: ''[[Meu Coco]]''\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Live albums===\n*1968: ''Ao Vivo'' (with [[Os Mutantes]])\n*1972: ''Barra 69 ao Vivo na Bahia'' (with [[Gilberto Gil]])\n*1972: ''Caetano e Chico \u2013 juntos e ao vivo'' (with [[Chico Buarque]])\n*1974: ''Temporada de Ver\u00e3o \u2013 Ao Vivo na Bahia'' (with [[Gal Costa]] and [[Gilberto Gil]])\n*1976: ''[[Doces B\u00e1rbaros]]'' (with [[Gal Costa]], [[Gilberto Gil]], and [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]])\n*1977: ''Bicho Baile Show'' (with [[Banda Black Rio]])\n*1978: ''Maria Beth\u00e2nia e Caetano Veloso ao Vivo'' (with [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]])\n*1986: ''Totalmente Demais''\n*1992: ''Circulad\u00f4 Vivo''\n*1994: ''Fina Estampa ao Vivo''\n*1999: ''Prenda Minha''\n*1999: ''Omaggio a Federico e Giulietta''\n*2001: ''Noites do Norte ao Vivo''\n*2002: ''Live in Bahia''\n*2007: ''C\u00ea ao Vivo''\n*2011: ''MTV ao Vivo \u2013 Caetano \u2013 Zii e Zie''\n*2011: ''Caetano e Maria Gad\u00fa Multishow ao Vivo'' (with [[Maria Gad\u00fa]])\n*2012: ''[[Live at Carnegie Hall (David Byrne and Caetano Veloso album)|Live at Carnegie Hall]]'' (recorded in 2004 with [[David Byrne]])\n*2013: ''Abra\u00e7a\u00e7o ao Vivo''\n*2016: ''Dois Amigos'' (Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil)\n*2018: ''Ofertorio''\n*2020: ''Caetano Veloso & Ivan Sacerdote''\n\n===Soundtracks===\n*1995: ''[[O Quatrilho]]''\n*1996: ''[[Tieta of Agreste]]''\n*1999: ''[[Orfeu]]''\n*2002: ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (''Hable con ella'') (song \"[[Cucurrucuc\u00fa paloma]]\", live)\n*2002: ''[[Frida (soundtrack)|Frida]]'' \n*2004: ''[[Meu Tio Matou um Cara]]''\n*2004: ''[[Eros (film)|Eros]]'' \n*2006: ''[[Nacho Libre]]''\n*2007: ''[[\u00d3 Pa\u00ed, \u00d3]]''\n*2008: ''Romance''\n*2016: ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]'' (\"Cucurrucuc\u00fa paloma\")\n\n===Compilations===\n*1996: ''[[Red Hot + Rio]]'', AIDS-Benefit Album produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]], contributor on track \"\u00c9 Preciso Perdoar\"\n*1998: ''[[Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon]]'', AIDS-Benefit Album produced by the Red Hot Organization, contributor on track \"Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses\"\n*2002: ''Todo Caetano'' ([[box set]])\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\n{{Main|List of awards received by Caetano Veloso}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Perrone, Charles A.
