Floggingmolly.com, Retrieved on March 13, 2020.</ref> formed in Los Angeles in 1997, led by Irish vocalist [[Dave King (Irish singer)|Dave King]], formerly of the hard rock band [[Fastway (band)|Fastway]].  They are signed to their own [[record label]], Borstal Beat Records.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nPrior to forming Flogging Molly, [[Dublin]]-born Dave King was the lead singer for heavy metal band [[Fastway (band)|Fastway]] featuring guitarist [[Eddie Clarke (musician)|\"Fast\" Eddie Clarke]] of Mot\u00f6rhead in the early to mid '80s. He later fronted a hard rock band called Katmandu (1991), featuring [[Mandy Meyer]] of [[Krokus (band)|Krokus]] on guitars. Afterwards, Dave King retained a record deal with [[Epic Records]] and began to work on a solo album, but began to reconsider his record deal when the label opposed his idea of bringing in traditional Irish instruments. King negotiated out of his record deal to go his own way musically soon after.\n\nIn 1993, King met guitarist [[Ted Hutt]], bassist Jeff Peters, drummer Paul Crowder<ref name=\"floggingmolly.com\"/> and [[violin]] player Bridget Regan and put together a rock band with a Celtic feel.  They began to play a mix of Irish traditional and rock.  Putting Dave's poetic lyrics to rocking melodies, they played at a Los Angeles pub called Molly Malone's weekly, building a small but loyal following. Together, they wrote songs such as \"Black Friday Rule\" and \"Selfish Man\", which was the beginning of Flogging Molly's sound. Ted and Jeff then left Flogging Molly because an earlier band of theirs, Reacharound, received a record deal.  Dave and Bridget began to find new members and the current band was formed.\n\nThey continued a routine of playing every Monday night at Molly Malone's. They put out a live album, ''[[Alive Behind the Green Door]]'' in 1997. In an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine, King stated that the band's name comes from the bar (Molly Malone's) that faithfully supported the band from the very beginning, \"We used to play there every Monday night and we felt like we were flogging it to death, so we called the band Flogging Molly.\" They were signed onto SideOneDummy Records after a show when the record company's owners attended a concert and noted their intensity.\n\n===Career===\nFlogging Molly has released an independent (26f Records) live album titled ''[[Alive Behind the Green Door]]'', as well as six studio albums: ''[[Swagger (Flogging Molly album)|Swagger]]'', ''[[Drunken Lullabies]]'', ''[[Within a Mile of Home]]'', ''[[Float (Flogging Molly album)|Float]]'', ''[[Speed of Darkness (Flogging Molly album)|Speed of Darkness]]'', and ''[[Life Is Good (Flogging Molly album)|Life Is Good]]''; and an acoustic/live DVD/cd combo ''[[Whiskey on a Sunday (album)|Whiskey on a Sunday]]'', which has gone platinum.  They have toured with the [[Warped Tour]], [[Larry Kirwan]]'s American Fl\u00e9adh Festival and contributed to the [[Rock Against Bush]] project. They have sold in excess of a million and a half copies of recorded output as of December 6, 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kick.dk/search/plade/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726113530/http://www.kick.dk/index.php?l=en&s=plade&pladeid=317|url-status=dead|title=Du s\u00f8gte efter plade|archivedate=July 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, the band released an exclusive EP through [[iTunes]] entitled ''Complete Control Sessions''. The EP includes two new tracks, as well as acoustic versions of previously released songs.  A year later Flogging Molly released [[Float (Flogging Molly album)|''Float'']], an album dubbed \"one of the most important CDs of the year, if not the decade\" by [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Flogging Molly also recognized the album as influential to their career as their first album recorded in Ireland (though mixed in California) by producer Ryan Hewitt.  Fans met the release with great anticipation and enthusiasm, landing it at No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart.  The album includes the band's first two chart singles, ''Requiem for a Dying Song'' (which hit No.&nbsp;35 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts)<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/302242/flogging+molly/chart |title=Flogging Molly \u2013 Chart history |publisher=Billboard |access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref> and ''Float'' (which hit No.&nbsp;40).<ref name=\"billboard\" /> Another accolade came to the band in June 2009 when their album \"[[Drunken Lullabies]]\" went gold.\n\nWhile touring to support [[Float (Flogging Molly album)|Float]], Dave and Bridget were married in a private ceremony in Tokyo, Japan. Flogging Molly released a live DVD/CD set called ''Live at the Greek Theater'' in March 2010.  The 3-disc set (double CD + full-length DVD) captures Flogging Molly's performance at the Greek Theatre on September 12, 2009, and includes content spanning the band's entire catalog. The band appeared in the 2011 season premiere of [[Austin City Limits]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.klru.tv/video/2144622797 |title=Flogging Molly \"Saints and Sinners\" &#124; Watch Austin City Limits Online &#124; KLRU |publisher=Video |access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Dave King Flogging Molly Sziget 2011.08.10.JPG|thumb|Dave King performing in 2011]]\n\nOn March 10, 2016, the band released their first new material in five years, a single titled \"The Hand of John L. Sullivan\", honoring the [[John L. Sullivan|Irish-American boxer of the same name]]. It is also the first studio recording with new drummer Mike Alonso. ''[[Life Is Good (Flogging Molly album)|Life Is Good]]'' was released the following year and the band's follow-up to that was 2022's ''[[Anthem (Flogging Molly album)|Anthem]]''.\n\n=== Salty Dog Cruises (2015\u2013present) ===\nFrom March 13 to 16, 2015, Flogging Molly began hosting a yearly Caribbean cruise. The 2015 Salty Dog Cruise Cruise<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floggingmollycruise.com|title=Flogging Molly's Salty Dog Cruise \u2013 2018|website=FloggingMollyCruise.com|language=en-US|access-date=August 29, 2017}}</ref> featured shows by the band and many others, over three days leaving from [[Miami]] to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and [[Great Stirrup Cay]] on the ''[[Norwegian Sky]]''. All bands performed two times on the stages throughout the ship or on the special stage set on [[Norwegian Cruise Line|Norwegian]]'s private island of Great Stirrup Cay.<ref name=\"floggingmolly.com\"/>\n\nIn 2016, from March 18 to 21, the second yearly cruise took the same itinerary on the same ship and hosted, among others, [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[Fishbone]], [[Frank Turner]], [[Street Dogs]] and [[The Tossers]].\n\nIn 2017, the ''[[MS Enchantment of the Seas|Enchantment of the Seas]]'' hosted the third annual cruise that left on March 10 to [[Coco Cay]] and Nassau, until coming back to Miami on March 13. The guests invited by the band were [[NOFX]], [[DeVotchKa]], [[Less Than Jake]], [[The English Beat]], [[The Skatalites]], [[The Bouncing Souls]], [[Dylan Walshe]] and many others.\n\nOn August 21, 2017, the band announced that the 2018 cruise will take place April 20\u201323, leaving from Miami, sailing to [[Key West]] and to [[Great Stirrup Cay]]. Originally, the cruise was supposed to take place on the ''Enchantment of the Seas'' as in 2017; however, the ship was changed and the [[Norwegian Sky]] has been announced. The line-up includes [[The Offspring]], [[Buzzcocks]], [[The Vandals]], [[Lagwagon]], and [[Mad Caddies]], among others.\n\n==Musical style==\nFlogging Molly's music is influenced by various artists, such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Pogues]], [[Greenland Whalefishers]],<ref>{{Citation|title=Flogging Molly greets Greenland Whalefishers with accoustic &#91;sic&#93; instrumental Irish Punk Jam Celtic Punk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwY8T7jWvcQ|language=en|access-date=2021-12-30}}</ref> [[Horslips]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[The Clash]]. The album ''Within a Mile of Home'' is dedicated to the memories of Cash and The Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]].\n\nTheir music ranges from boisterous Celtic punk, like the pirate-themed \"Salty Dog\", \"Cruel Mistress\", and \"Seven Deadly Sins\" or the defiant \"What's Left of the Flag\", \"Drunken Lullabies\", and \"Rebels of the Sacred Heart\" to more somber songs like \"Far Away Boys\", \"The Son Never Shines (On Closed Doors)\", \"Life in a Tenement Square\" and \"Float\". Lyrics typically touch on subjects such as Ireland and its history, drinking, poverty, politics, love, and death and include several references to the [[Catholic Church]]. \"What's Left of the Flag\" and \"The Likes of You Again\" were written as tributes to Dave King's father, who died when King was a child.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/07/27/warped-tour-oceanport-719/ |title = inTuneMusic Online: Warped Tour @ Oceanport 7/19 |access-date = July 28, 2009 |author = Ambrose, Anthony |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://archive.today/20120529174420/http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/07/27/warped-tour-oceanport-719/ |archive-date = May 29, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Current===\n* [[Dave King (Irish singer)|Dave King]] \u2013 [[lead vocals]], [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[bodhr\u00e1n]], [[banjo]], [[spoons (musical instrument)|spoons]]\n* Bridget Regan \u2013 [[violin]], [[tin whistle]], [[backing vocals|backing and lead vocals]]\n* Dennis Casey \u2013 [[lead guitar|guitar]], [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n* Matt Hensley \u2013 [[accordion]], [[concertina]]\n* Nathen Maxwell \u2013 [[bass guitar]], [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n*[[ZOX|Spencer Swain]] \u2013 [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], guitar, [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n* Mike Alonso \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]], [[percussion]]\n{{col-2}}\n=== Former ===\n* John Donovan \u2013 guitar\n* Tobe McCallum \u2013 mandolin\n* Ted Hutt \u2013 guitar\n* Jeff Peters \u2013 bass\n* Paul Crowder \u2013 drums\n* Gary Sullivan \u2013 drums\n* George Schwindt \u2013 drums\n* Gary Schwindt \u2013 trumpet\n* [[Bob Schmidt (musician)|Bob Schmidt]] \u2013 mandolin/banjo, bouzouki, guitar, vocals\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Flogging Molly discography}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[Swagger (Flogging Molly album)|Swagger]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Drunken Lullabies]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Within a Mile of Home]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Float (Flogging Molly album)|Float]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Speed of Darkness]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Life Is Good (Flogging Molly album)|Life Is Good]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[Anthem (Flogging Molly album)|Anthem]]'' (2022)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{Official website}}\n*{{MusicBrainz artist|id=c3694ddc-f7e5-40dd-9fad-90d11a2c50fa|name=Flogging Molly}}\n*[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/band-at-top-of-us-chart-unknown-at-home-1318903.html Interview with Dave King in the Irish Independent]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070314020422/http://www.thepunksite.com/interviews.php?page=floggingmolly Interview with Bob Schmidt in 2007]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120209140734/http://www.burningstars.net/fm06 Burning Stars Interview with Flogging Molly \u2013 2006]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090906175042/http://www.roxwel.com/player/floggingmollyuncut.html Flogging Molly Music Videos-Interviews-Live Performance] at Roxwel\n\n{{Flogging Molly}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flogging Molly}}\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Celtic punk groups]]\n[[Category:Irish-American culture]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:Punk rock groups from California]]\n[[Category:Rise Records artists]]\n[[Category:SideOneDummy Records artists]]", "sha1": "7udip25h97l3dxga5jw3390x2nrt79c"}
