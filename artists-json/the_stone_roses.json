One of the pioneering groups of the [[Madchester]] movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band's classic and most prominent lineup consisted of vocalist [[Ian Brown]], guitarist [[John Squire]], bassist [[Mani (musician)|Mani]] and drummer [[Reni (musician)|Reni]].\n\nThe band released their debut album, ''[[The Stone Roses (album)|The Stone Roses]]'', in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band and received critical acclaim, many{{efn|Refer to [[The Stone Roses (album)#Accolades]]}} regarding it as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded. At this time the group decided to capitalise on their success by signing to a major label. Their record label at the time, [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone]], would not let them out of their contract, which led to a long legal battle that culminated with the band signing with [[Geffen Records]] in 1991.\n\nThe Stone Roses released their second album, ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'', in 1994, which received mixed reviews.<ref name=\"VoxFeb1995\">{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Johnny|title=Coming Out|url=http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/press/vox-february-1995|access-date=24 November 2011|newspaper=Vox|date=February 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312041444/http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/press/vox-february-1995 |archive-date=12 March 2010|pages=14\u201319|format=print}}</ref> The group soon disbanded after several line-up changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni departing in early 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at [[Reading Festival]].\n\nFollowing much intensified media speculation, the Stone Roses called a press conference on 18 October 2011 to announce that the band had reunited and would perform a [[Reunion Tour (The Stone Roses)|reunion world tour]] in 2012, including three homecoming shows in [[Heaton Park]], Manchester.<ref name=\"officialreunion\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-stone-roses/59839 |title=Ian Brown on the Stone Roses reunion: 'It's happening' |work=NME |date=17 October 2011 |access-date=17 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/18/stone-roses-reunite-world-tour?newsfeed=true|title=Stone Roses announce comeback gigs in Manchester with world tour in pipeline|date=18 October 2011|work=guardian.co.uk|access-date=18 October 2011|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15348374|title=The Stone Roses to reunite for tour|date=18 October 2011|work=BBC News|access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref> Plans to record a third album in the future were also floated but only two singles were released.<ref name=\"newalbum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacelab.tv/spaceLAB/2011/10October/MusicNews-059-Stone-Roses-Reunion-Tour-New-Album-Press-Conference.htm|title=Stone Roses Reunion Tour and New Album is Happening|date=18 October 2011|work=Spacelab|access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref> In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of a new [[Spike Island (film)|film]] which is set during the Stone Roses 1990 Spike Island show, revealed that the band \"have at least three or four new tracks recorded\".<ref name=\"Benson\">''SSG Music'' (2012) [http://www.ssgmusic.com/stone-roses-confirm-new-material/ \"Stone Roses Have Recorded New Material\"]</ref><ref name=\"NME\">''NME'' (2012) [https://www.nme.com/news/the-stone-roses/63911 \"The Stone Roses have at least three or four new tracks recorded\"]</ref> In June 2013, a documentary about the band's reformation directed by [[Shane Meadows]] and titled ''[[The Stone Roses: Made of Stone]]'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2126403/|title=The Stone Roses: Made of Stone (2013)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the Stone Roses released their first new material in two decades. The band members continued to tour until June 2017, at which point cryptic remarks by Brown indicated the band had split again, which was later confirmed in a 2019 interview with Squire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/16/john-squire-interview|title=John Squire: 'I don't think I'm a very good guitar player \u2013 or painter'|website=theguardian.com|date=16 September 2019|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation (1983\u20131984)===\n[[Ian Brown]] (at the time the bassist) and guitarist [[John Squire]], who knew each other from [[Altrincham Grammar School for Boys]], formed a short-lived [[The Clash|Clash]]-inspired band, the Patrol, in 1980 with singer/guitarist Andy Couzens and drummer [[Simon Wolstencroft]].<ref>Robb, p. 40</ref><ref name=\"Taylor\">Taylor (2004)</ref> They played several gigs in 1980 and recorded a [[demo tape]], but towards the end of that year decided on a change of direction.<ref name=\"Robb46\">Robb, p. 46</ref> Brown had got a taste of being a frontman during the last Patrol show, singing [[The Sweet|Sweet]]'s \"[[Block Buster!]]\" to close the set, with the band's friend/roadie Pete Garner standing in on bass, and Couzens wanting to concentrate on guitar.<ref name=\"Robb46\" /> The band members lost enthusiasm in 1981, Brown selling his bass guitar to buy a scooter, and Wolstencroft joined [[Johnny Marr]] and [[Andy Rourke]]'s pre-[[The Smiths|Smiths]] band [[Freak Party]].<ref name=\"Robb48\">Robb, p. 48</ref> Squire continued to practice guitar<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> while working as an animator for [[Cosgrove Hall]] during the day, while Brown ran a [[Northern soul]] night in a [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] club. \n\nSquire and Couzens started a new band, the Fireside Chaps, with bassist Gary \"Mani\" Mounfield, later recruiting a singer named David \"Kaiser\" Carty and drummer Chris Goodwin, and changing their name to the Waterfront (after the film ''[[On the Waterfront]]''), their sound influenced by 1960s groups and contemporary bands such as [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]].<ref name=\"Taylor\" /><ref name=\"Robb65\">Robb, p. 65, 68</ref> Goodwin left before the band recorded their first demo and, shortly after the demo, Squire asked Brown to join as singer. A meeting with [[Geno Washington]] at a party at Brown's flat in Hulme, in which Washington told Brown that he would be a star and should be a singer, convinced Brown to take Squire up on his offer.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;70\u201371</ref> Brown joined the Waterfront in late 1983, for a time sharing vocals with Kaiser (Dave Carty).<ref>Robb, p. 71</ref>\n\nLike the earlier attempts at bands, the Waterfront fizzled out, but in late 1983 Couzens decided to try again at starting a band, and approached Brown.<ref>Robb, p. 77</ref> They decided on Wolstencroft (who had turned down the job of drummer in The Smiths) as drummer and Pete Garner as bassist (despite his admission that he could not play anything but \"Block Buster!\").<ref name=\"Robb78\">Robb, p. 78</ref> They also decided that they needed Squire in the band, and when he agreed the band's line-up was cemented.<ref name=\"Robb78\" /> Leaving their previous bands behind, they worked solely on new material. Brown's vocal limitations prompted him to take singing lessons for three weeks.<ref>Robb, p. 79</ref> After rehearsing for some time without a band name, Squire came up with \"The Stone Roses\". Several stories later emerged suggesting that the band had initially been called \"English Rose\" or that the name was somehow linked to [[the Rolling Stones]], but these were untrue, Brown explaining \"No, I don't know where that English Rose story came from. John thought up the name 'Stone Roses' - something with a contrast, two words that went against each other\".<ref>Robb, p. 80</ref> The band rehearsed for six months, during which time Wolstencroft had been auditioning for other bands, and he left to join [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]]'s band [[the Colourfield]].<ref>Robb, p. 81</ref> They got Goodwin to rejoin, but he lasted for only one rehearsal, so they advertised for a replacement and began auditioning, eventually recruiting Alan \"Reni\" Wren in May 1984.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;83\u20134</ref>\n\nAfter rehearsing and writing songs over the summer, they recorded their first demo in late August, making 100 cassettes, with artwork by Squire, and set about trying to get gigs.<ref>Robb, p. 91</ref> They played their first gig as the Stone Roses on 23 October 1984, supporting [[Pete Townshend]] at an anti-[[heroin]] concert at the Moonlight Club in London, Brown having sent the demo with an accompanying letter stating \"I'm surrounded by skagheads, I wanna smash 'em. Can you give us a show?\".<ref name=\"Robb92\">Robb, p.&nbsp;91\u201392</ref> The show was seen by journalists including ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''{{'}} Garry Johnson, who arranged to interview the band a few weeks later.<ref>Robb, p. 98</ref> The band received management offers and more gigs soon followed.\n\nHoward(Ginger)Jones, who had recently left his job as Director and General manager of [[the Ha\u00e7ienda]], producer [[Martin Hannett]], and Tim Chambers agreed to work with the band on an album, setting up Thin Line Records to release it, with Jones taking on management of the band, although they had already made a similar agreement with Caroline Reed in London.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;99\u2013100</ref> The band got their first positive press in late December, with Johnson tipping them for success in 1985 in ''Sounds'', with a feature on the band following in January.<ref>Robb, p. 107</ref>\n\n===Early tour and releases (1985\u20131988)===\nThe band played their first headlining gig on 4 January 1985, supported by [[Last Party]], after original headliners Mercenary Skank had pulled out.<ref>Robb, p. 108</ref> The band had their first recording session with Hannett in January 1985 at Strawberry Studios in [[Stockport]], aiming to record tracks for a debut single and an album.<ref>Robb, p. 103</ref> Further sessions followed in March, during which they recorded their debut single, the [[double A-side]] \"[[So Young (The Stone Roses song)|So Young]]\"/\"Tell Me\".<ref>Robb, p. 110</ref> The band were invited to play a live session on [[Piccadilly Radio]] in March, for which they premiered a new song, \"I Wanna Be Adored\".<ref>Robb, p. 113</ref> Tony Michaelides (AKA Tony the Greek) from the station arranged for five local bands to play at [[Dingwalls]] in London on February 8th: Glee Company, Communal Drop, Fictitious Names, Laugh, and the Stone Roses. [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]], another Piccadilly DJ, was comp\u00e8re for the night. By this time the Stone Roses had started to build a sizeable following in Manchester and their first gig in the North of England at Clouds in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], which attracted a large audience, descended into a riot after technical problems and friction between the bands on the bill.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;115\u20137</ref>\n\nThe Roses embarked on a tour of Sweden in April, with their first gig in Manchester following on their return, at [[The International Nightclub Manchester|International 1]], a venue run by future Stone Roses managers Matthew Cummins and Gareth Evans.<ref>Robb, p. 122</ref> A performance at a warehouse party on 20 July helped to build interest in the band, and in August they returned to the studio to record their debut album.<ref>Robb, p. 128</ref> Unhappy with the results, and with the band's sound changing, it was shelved (it was later released as ''[[Garage Flower]]'').<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> The \"So Young\"/\"Tell Me\" single, however, was released on Thin Line Records in September.\n\nFrustrated with the lack of attention they were getting locally, they engaged in a graffiti campaign, with Brown and Wren spraying the band's name on walls from [[West Didsbury]] to the city centre.<ref>Robb, p. 138</ref> It brought them much negative publicity, but added to their increasing notoriety. In 1986 they began working on new material, including \"[[Sally Cinnamon]]\", and the planned follow-up singles to \"So Young\" (\"I Wanna Be Adored\" and \"This Is the One\") were shelved.<ref>Robb, p. 143</ref> They parted company with Jones and took on Gareth Evans as manager, using Evans' International 1 venue as their new rehearsal space. Around this time the band played several UK tour dates including 11 August 1986 at the Mardi Gras club in Liverpool with local promoter and record label owner Ken Kelly and his band Innervision at which several record company executives would be in attendance.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;146\u20138</ref>\n\nAs Brown and Squire began collaborating more closely on songwriting, they decided that they should take a larger slice of the money than the other band members. Couzens and Wren left the band in protest, although they soon returned. Couzens played an ill-fated gig with the band at the end of May before being pushed out of the band by Evans after flying home alone while the rest of the band returned in their van.<ref>Robb, p. 150</ref> Although they failed to achieve further success in 1986, their repertoire expanded to include songs such as \"Sugar Spun Sister\", taking on influences from bands such as [[The Jesus & Mary Chain]] and the indie-pop era [[Primal Scream]] (\"[[Velocity Girl (song)|Velocity Girl]]\" being a major influence on \"Made of Stone\"), and they stopped playing the older songs.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;154\u20135</ref>\n\nIn December 1986 they recorded their first demo as a four-piece, including the first studio recordings of \"Sugar Spun Sister\" and \"Elephant Stone\".<ref>Robb, p. 156</ref> In early 1987, Evans negotiated a deal with [[Revolver Music|Black/FM Revolver]] for a one-off release on the specially created Black Records label. By the time of the release of the single, \"Sally Cinnamon\", the group's sound had changed considerably, with chiming guitar [[Hook (music)|hooks]] and a strong melody, alienating some of their old fans, but attracting many new ones.<ref>Robb, p. 162</ref> \"Sally Cinnamon\" sold out its 1,000-copy run, but failed to make the desired impact.\n\nIn June, Garner announced that he had decided to leave the band, although he stayed until they found a replacement. He played his final gig with the band at the 'Larks in the Park' festival in Liverpool.<ref name=\"Robb166\">Robb, p. 166</ref> Rob Hampson was Garner's replacement, with Garner teaching him the bass parts before leaving, although Hampson lasted only a week.<ref name=\"Robb167\">Robb, p. 167</ref> A more permanent replacement was found in the form of former-Waterfront bassist Mani ([[Mani (musician)|Gary Mounfield]]), who played his first gig with the band in November 1987.<ref name=\"Robb167\" /> Brown recalled, \"When Mani joined it almost changed overnight. It became a totally different groove&nbsp;... Straight away, everything just fell into place\".<ref name=\"McCready\">McReady</ref>\n\nIn early 1988 the band played at Dingwalls in London, a show attended by representatives of [[Zomba Music Group|Zomba]] and [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]'s [[Geoff Travis]], and both subsequently wanted to sign the band. Rough Trade even funded studio time to record a single, \"[[Elephant Stone]]\", with [[Peter Hook]] producing.<ref>Robb, p. 173</ref> Hook was considered to produce an album for the band, but was unavailable due to commitments with [[New Order (band)|New Order]], so Travis suggested [[John Leckie]].<ref>Robb, p. 176</ref> In May the band played a high-profile concert at Manchester's International II with [[James (band)|James]] organized by [[Dave Haslam]] to raise funds for a campaign against [[Section 28|Clause 28]].<ref name=\"Haslam\">Haslam, p. 180</ref> The band attempted to usurp James by putting up posters around town listing the Stone Roses as headliners, and delaying their start time to get the headline time themselves and limit the time that James could play for.<ref>Robb, p. 180</ref> In the audience was a sixteen-year-old [[Liam Gallagher]], for whom it was the inspiration to form a band himself.<ref>Robb, p. 181</ref> [[Noel Gallagher]] too has stated that he was inspired to the same by attending one of their gigs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfR6JoDExcc |title=Noel Gallagher about Stone Roses |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-06 |access-date=2014-02-27}}</ref> Also in the audience was Glaswegian Roddy McKenna, [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive with Zomba, who later signed the band to the label. He asked if they could be transferred internally to Andrew Lauder's newly created guitar-based Silvertone Records subsidiary. The band were signed to an eight-album deal, buying the \"Elephant Stone\" tapes from Rough Trade and releasing them as a single in October 1988.\n\nThe band were co-managed by Matthew Cummins who died in 2007 following an accident.\n\n===Debut album and breakthrough success (1989\u20131991)===\n{{main|The Stone Roses (album)}}\n\nIn 1988 and early 1989 the Stone Roses recorded their debut album at Battery Studios and [[Konk (recording)|Konk Studios]] in London and [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales, produced by Leckie.<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> The first single for Silvertone, \"[[Elephant Stone]]\", made little impact, and in early 1989 the band's performances outside the north-west were still attracting small audiences.<ref>Robb, p. 195</ref> \"[[Made of Stone]]\" received more press attention and was picked up for airplay by DJ [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] on his late night Radio One show, but peaked at number ninety on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

The members would often display no interest in promoting themselves, which was typified through reticent and capricious behaviour. Even with the Stone Roses' reformation in 2011, the group continued to provide few interviews. This approach left many journalists confused and sometimes angered.\n\nA typical example is the Spike Island press conference in 1990, which was attended by much of the world's music press. This ended in chaos when the gathered journalists began a small riot, believing the band to be deliberately upsetting them.\n\nAs John Robb commented: \"The Stone Roses would stonewall the journalist[s]. With shy guffaws, muttered asides, dispassionate staring, foot-shuffling silences and complete mind-numbing gaps, punctuated by the odd piece of incisive home-spun philosophy from Brown, who occasionally hinted at a well-read mind. There would be complete silence from John Squire, witty banter from Reni, and Mani spouting off if he let his guard drop.\"<ref name=\"Robb, P. 225\">Robb, P. 225</ref> However, Robb clarified they \"were no fools when it came to the media\".<ref name=\"Robb, P. 225\"/> He concluded: \"One feature of the band's career had been their ability to stay on the news pages of the rock press almost permanently for years on end, including the years when they did fuck all. And they did this by hardly saying anything at all.\"<ref name=\"Robb, P. 225\"/>\n\nAlthough the aforementioned reformation conference in October 2011 displayed an elated and talkative Stone Roses engaging with the press, it was followed by total media silence. Other than [[Shane Meadows]]' documentary in 2013, the band provided no further interviews.\n\n==Band members==\n\n=== Final members ===\n*[[Ian Brown]]&nbsp;\u2013 lead vocals, percussion {{small|(1983\u20131996, 2011\u20132017)}}\n*[[John Squire]]&nbsp;\u2013 guitar, backing vocals {{small|(1983\u20131996, 2011\u20132017)}}\n*[[Mani (musician)|Mani]] {{small|(Gary Mounfield)}}&nbsp;\u2013 bass guitar {{small|(1987\u20131996, 2011\u20132017)}}\n*[[Reni (musician)|Reni]] {{small|(Alan Wren)}}&nbsp;\u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals {{small|(1984\u20131995, 2011\u20132017)}}\n\n=== Former members ===\n*Pete Garner&nbsp;\u2013 bass {{small|(1983\u20131987)}}\n*Andy Couzens&nbsp;\u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals {{small|(1983\u20131986)}}\n*[[Simon Wolstencroft]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums {{small|(1983\u20131984)}}\n*Rob Hampson&nbsp;\u2013 bass {{Small|(1987)}}\n*Cressa \u2013 dancing {{small|(1989)}}\n*Robbie Maddix&nbsp;\u2013 drums, backing vocals {{small|(1995\u20131996)}}\n*[[Nigel Ipinson]]&nbsp;\u2013 keyboards, backing vocals {{small|(1995\u20131996)}}\n*[[Aziz Ibrahim]]&nbsp;\u2013 guitar {{small|(1996)}}\n\n=== Timeline ===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:350\nPlotArea = left:150 bottom:120 top:0 right:20\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1983 till:24/06/2017\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1983\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1983\n\nColors =\n  id:voc value:red legend:Vocals\n  id:bv value:pink legend:Backing_vocals\n  id:lg    value:teal legend:Lead_guitar\n  id:rg value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitar\n  id:key value:purple legend:Keyboards\n  id:b  value:blue legend:Bass\n  id:dr  value:orange legend:Drums\n  id:p   value:claret legend:Percussion\n  id:d  value:yellow legend:Dancing\n  id:alb  value:black legend:Album_release\n\nLineData =\n  at:01/04/1989 layer:back\n  at:05/12/1994\n\nPlotData =\n  width:11 textcolor:pink align:left anchor:from shift:(10,\u20134)\n  bar:Ian&nbsp;Brown from:start till:01/10/1996 color:voc\n  bar:Ian&nbsp;Brown from:18/10/2011 till:end color:voc\n  bar:Ian&nbsp;Brown from:start till:01/10/1996 color:p width:3\n  bar:Ian&nbsp;Brown from:18/10/2011 till:end color:p width:3\n  bar:John&nbsp;Squire from:start till:01/04/1996 color:lg\n  bar:John&nbsp;Squire from:01/06/1986 till:01/04/1996 color:rg width:7\n  bar:John&nbsp;Squire from:18/10/2011 till:end color:lg\n  bar:John&nbsp;Squire from:18/10/2011 till:end color:rg width:7\n  bar:John&nbsp;Squire from:start till:01/04/1996 color:bv width:3\n  bar:John&nbsp;Squire from:18/10/2011 till:end color:bv width:3\n  bar:Aziz&nbsp;Ibrahim from:01/04/1996 till:01/10/1996 color:lg\n  bar:Aziz&nbsp;Ibrahim from:01/04/1996 till:01/10/1996 color:rg width:3\n  bar:Andy&nbsp;Couzens from:start till:01/06/1986 color:rg\n  bar:Andy&nbsp;Couzens from:start till:01/06/1986 color:bv width:3\n  bar:Nigel&nbsp;Ipinson from:01/04/1995 till:01/10/1996 color:key\n  bar:Nigel&nbsp;Ipinson from:01/04/1995 till:01/10/1996 color:bv width:3\n  bar:Pete&nbsp;Garner from:start till:01/07/1987 color:b\n  bar:Rob&nbsp;Hampson from:01/07/1987 till:01/11/1987 color:b\n  bar:Mani&nbsp;(Gary&nbsp;Mounfield) from:01/11/1987 till:01/10/1996 color:b\n  bar:Mani&nbsp;(Gary&nbsp;Mounfield) from:18/10/2011 till:end color:b\n  bar:Simon&nbsp;Wolstencroft from:start till:01/05/1984 color:dr\n  bar:Reni&nbsp;(Alan&nbsp;Wren) from:01/05/1984 till:01/03/1995 color:dr\n  bar:Reni&nbsp;(Alan&nbsp;Wren) from:18/10/2011 till:end color:dr\n  bar:Reni&nbsp;(Alan&nbsp;Wren) from:01/05/1984 till:01/03/1995 color:p width:7\n  bar:Reni&nbsp;(Alan&nbsp;Wren) from:18/10/2011 till:end color:p width:7\n  bar:Reni&nbsp;(Alan&nbsp;Wren) from:01/05/1984 till:01/03/1995 color:bv width:3\n  bar:Reni&nbsp;(Alan&nbsp;Wren) from:18/10/2011 till:end color:bv width:3\n \n  bar:Robbie&nbsp;Maddix from:01/03/1995 till:01/10/1996 color:dr\n  bar:Robbie&nbsp;Maddix from:01/03/1995 till:01/10/1996 color:bv width:3\n  bar:Cressa from:19/06/1989 till:19/12/1989 color:d\n}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|The Stone Roses discography|List of songs recorded by the Stone Roses}}\n* ''[[The Stone Roses (album)|The Stone Roses]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'' (1994)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bands and artists from England]]\n*[[List of dance-rock artists]]\n*[[List of Geffen Records artists]]\n*[[List of music artists and bands from Manchester]]\n*[[List of NME Award winners]]\n*[[List of performers on Top of the Pops|List of performers on ''Top of the Pops'']]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Works cited==\n*Haslam, Dave (2000) ''Manchester, England'', Fourth Estate, {{ISBN|1-84115-146-7}}\n*McCready, John. \"So Near So Far\".
