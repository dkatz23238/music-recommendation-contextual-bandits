Billed as \"The Only Band That Matters\", they also contributed to the {{nowrap|[[post-punk]]}} and [[new wave music|new wave]] movements that emerged in the wake of punk and employed elements of a variety of genres including [[reggae]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[funk]], [[ska]], and [[rockabilly]]. For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Joe Strummer]], lead guitarist and vocalist [[Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)|Mick Jones]], bassist [[Paul Simonon]], and drummer [[Topper Headon|Nicky \"Topper\" Headon]]. \n\nHeadon left the group in 1982 due to internal friction surrounding his increasing heroin addiction. Further internal friction led to Jones' departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.\nThe Clash achieved critical and commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their self-titled debut album, ''[[The Clash (album)|The Clash]]'' (1977) and their second album, ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]'' (1978). Their experimental third album, ''[[London Calling]]'', released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States when it was released there the following month. A decade later, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named it the best album of the 1980s. Following continued musical experimentation on their fourth album, ''[[Sandinista!]]'' (1980), the band reached new heights of success with the release of ''[[Combat Rock]]'' (1982), which spawned the US top 10 hit \"[[Rock the Casbah]]\", helping the album to achieve a 2\u00d7 Platinum certification there. A final album, ''[[Cut the Crap]]'', was released in 1985 with a new lineup, and a few weeks later, the band broke up.<ref name=\"bbcco-Strummer_dies\">{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2600669.stm | title = Clash star Strummer dies | access-date =20 November 2007 | date = 27 December 2002 | format = STM | work=Entertainment | publisher=BBC News World Edition}}</ref> \n\nIn January 2003, shortly after the death of Joe Strummer, the band\u2014including original drummer [[Terry Chimes]]\u2014were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

By the time the Clash came together two years later, he had already abandoned his original stage name, \"Woody\" Mellor, in favour of \"Joe Strummer\", a reference to his rudimentary [[Strum|strumming]] skills on the ukulele as a [[Busking|busker]] in the [[London Underground]].\n\n[[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] played guitar in [[protopunk]] band [[London SS]], which rehearsed for much of 1975 without ever playing a live show and recording only a single demo. London SS were managed by [[Bernard Rhodes]], a sometime associate of impresario [[Malcolm McLaren]] and a friend of the members of the McLaren-managed band, the [[Sex Pistols]]. Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols [[Glen Matlock]] and [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], who would assist them as they tried out potential new members.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=130\u2013132}} Among those who auditioned for London SS without making the cut were [[Paul Simonon]], who tried out as a vocalist,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=72}} and drummer [[Terry Chimes]]. [[Topper Headon|Nicky Headon]] drummed with the band for a week, then quit.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=56}}<ref name=Gilmore>{{cite magazine|last=Gilmore|first=Mikal|title=The Fury and the Power of the Clash|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=3 March 2011|issue=1125|pages=60\u201379}}</ref>\n\nAfter London SS broke up in early 1976, Rhodes continued as Jones' manager. In February, Jones saw the Sex Pistols perform for the first time: \"You knew straight away that was it, and this was what it was going to be like from now on. It was a new scene, new values\u2014so different from what had happened before. A bit dangerous.\"{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=151}} At the instigation of Rhodes, Jones contacted Simonon in March, suggesting he learn an instrument so he could join the new band Jones was organising.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=72}} Soon Jones, Simonon on bass, [[Keith Levene]] on guitar and \"whoever we could find really to play the drums\" were rehearsing.<ref name=\"bass player\">{{cite journal\n | last = Rowley\n | first = Scott\n |date=October 1999\n | title = Paul Simonon's first ever bass interview\n | journal=Bassist Magazine\n | issue = 10\n | location = London\n}}</ref> Chimes was asked to audition for the new band and got the job, although he soon quit.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=79}}\n\nThe band was still searching for a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who \"seemed to be, like, nineteen or eighteen then, as we all were\") handling the duties for a time.{{sfn|Strongman|2008|p=103}} Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=192, 193}} Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act for one of his band's gigs\u2014the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:<blockquote>I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future\u2014with a snotty handkerchief\u2014right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, \"Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them.\" The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, \"Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not.

In ''Westway to the World'', Jones confirms the 48-hour deadline, while Strummer says it was he who made the call after just 24 (11:34\u201311:40). Jones elsewhere gave a different account, according to which Strummer was originally given 24 hours to decide, and Rhodes called after just eight ([[#CITEREFRobb2006|Robb 2006]], p. 194).</ref> Simonon later remarked, \"Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together.\"<ref name=\"bass player\" /> Strummer introduced the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group. LaBritain's stint with the band did not last long (he subsequently joined [[999 (band)|999]]), and Terry Chimes\u2014whom Jones later referred to as \"one of the best drummers\" in their circle\u2014became the band's regular drummer.{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=17:16\u201317:22}}\n\nIn ''Westway to the World'', Jones also says, \"I don't think Terry was officially hired or anything.

The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]]\u2014another London SS spinoff\u2014made their own scheduled debut two days later.

At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, [[John Lydon]] (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=196}}\n\nHours after their debut, the band members along with most of the Sex Pistols and much of the rest of London's \"inner circle\" of punks showed up at [[Dingwalls]] club to attend a concert by [[New York City|New York]]'s leading punk rock band, the [[Ramones]]. \u201cIt can\u2019t be stressed how great the first Ramones album was to the scene \u2026 It was the first word of Punk, a fantastic record\u201d (Joe Strummer).{{Sfn|Clash|2008|p=61}} Afterward \"came the first example of the rivalry-induced squabbling that was to dog the punk scene and undermine any attempts to promote a spirit of unity among the bands involved.\"{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=144}}  Simonon got into a scuffle with [[Jean-Jacques Burnel|J.J. Burnel]], the bass player of [[the Stranglers]]. A slightly older band, the Stranglers were publicly identified with the punk scene, but were not part of the \"inner circle\" centered on the Sex Pistols.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=144}}\n\nWith Rhodes insisting that the band not perform live again until they were much tighter, the Clash rehearsed intensely over the following month. Strummer later described how seriously the band devoted itself to forging a distinct identity: \"The day I joined The Clash was very much back to square one, year zero. Part of Punk was that you had to shed all of what you knew before. We were almost Stalinist in the way that you had to shed all your friends, or everything that you'd known, or every way that you'd played before.\"{{Sfn|Clash|2008|p=61}}{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=14:57\u201315:08}}\n\nStrummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties\u2014\"Joe would give me the words and I would make a song out of them\", Jones later said.{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=326}} Sometimes they would meet in the office over their [[Camden Town|Camden]] rehearsal studio to collaborate directly.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=144}} According to a later description of Strummer's, \"Bernie [Rhodes] would say, 'An issue, an issue. Don't write about love, write about what's affecting you, what's important.\"<ref>[[#CITEREFSavage1992|Savage 1992]], p. 232. Jones's later take on the matter: \"Bernie had a hand in everything. Not the lyrics\u2014he didn't help with the lyrics. He didn't tell us not to write love songs, as the myth goes\u2014that's kind of simplified version of it. He told us to write what we knew about\" ([[#CITEREFRobb2006|Robb 2006]], p. 197).</ref>\n\nStrummer took the lead vocals on the majority of songs; in some cases he and Jones shared the lead. Once the band began recording, Jones would rarely have a solo lead on more than one song per album, though he would be responsible for two of the group's biggest hits. On 13 August, the Clash\u2014sporting a paint-spattered \"[[Jackson Pollock]]\" look\u2014played before a small, invitation-only audience in their Camden studio.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=195\u2013197}} Among those in attendance was ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' critic [[Giovanni Dadamo]]. His review described the band as a \"runaway train&nbsp;... so powerful, they're the first new group to come along who can really scare the Sex Pistols shitless\".{{sfn|Strongman|2008|p=133}}\n\nOn 29 August, the Clash and [[Manchester]]'s [[Buzzcocks]] opened for the Sex Pistols at The Screen on the Green, the Clash's first public performance since 4 July. The triple bill is seen as pivotal to the British punk scene's crystallisation into a movement,{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=212\u2013215}} though ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'' reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote, \"The Clash are the sort of garage band that should be speedily returned to the garage, preferably with the motor still running\".{{sfn|Salewicz|2006|p=162}} Strummer later credited Murray's comments with inspiring the band's composition [[Garageland (song)|\"Garageland\"]].{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=24:23\u201324:43}}\n\nIn early September, Levene was fired from the Clash. Strummer would claim that Levene's dwindling interest in the band owed to his supposedly extravagant use of [[Amphetamine|speed]], a charge Levene has denied.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=215\u2013216}}{{sfn|Savage|1992|p=220}} Levene and Lydon would form [[Public Image Ltd.]] in 1978.

Jones produced one cut, but the other members were dissatisfied. Production duties were handed to [[Glyn Johns]], and the album was reconceived as a single LP, and released as ''[[Combat Rock]]'' in May 1982. Though filled with offbeat songs, experiments with [[sound collage]], and a spoken word vocal by [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], it contained two \"radio friendly\" tracks.

Another Jones feature in a rock and roll style similar to \"Train in Vain\", it received heavy airplay on [[Album-oriented rock|AOR]] stations. The follow-up, \"[[Rock the Casbah]]\", put lyrics addressing the Iranian clampdown on imports of Western music to a bouncy dance rhythm.

Jones helped out with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' soundtrack.

Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time.
