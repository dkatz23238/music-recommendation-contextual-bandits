Often referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]\", she is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s. After appearing in stage productions and television series, Spears signed with [[Jive Records]] in 1997 at age fifteen. Her first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), are among the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]] and made Spears the best-selling teenage artist of all time. With first-week sales of [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|over 1.3&nbsp;million copies]], ''Oops!... I Did It Again'' held the record for the fastest-selling album by a female artist in the United States for fifteen years. Spears adopted a more mature and provocative style for her albums ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and starred in the 2002 film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''.\n\nSpears was executive producer of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), often referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=October 30, 2017|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|access-date=June 9, 2019|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Following a series of highly publicized personal problems, promotion for the album was limited, and Spears was involuntarily placed in a [[conservatorship]]. Since then, she released the chart-topping albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), the latter of which became her most successful era of singles in the US charts. She embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas to promote her next two albums ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016).
