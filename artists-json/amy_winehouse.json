She was known for her deep, expressive [[contralto]] vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including [[Soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues]] and [[jazz]].\n\nA member of the [[National Youth Jazz Orchestra]] during her youth, Winehouse signed to [[Simon Fuller]]'s [[19 Management]] in 2002 and soon recorded a number of songs before signing a publishing deal with [[EMI]]. She also formed a working relationship with producer [[Salaam Remi]] through these record publishers. Winehouse's debut album, ''[[Frank (Amy Winehouse album)|Frank]]'', was released in 2003. Many of the album's songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two [[Cover version|covers]], were co-written by Winehouse. ''Frank'' was a critical success in the UK and was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]]. The song \"[[Stronger Than Me]]\" won her the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Contemporary Song from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]].\n\nWinehouse released her follow-up album, ''[[Back to Black]]'', in 2006, which went on to become an international success and one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling albums in UK history]].<ref>{{cite web|first= Rob |last= Copsey |title= The UK's biggest studio albums of all time |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |date= 13 October 2018 |access-date= 11 April 2019 |url= https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-biggest-studio-albums-of-all-time__24431/}}</ref> At the [[2007 Brit Awards]] it was nominated for [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|British Album of the Year]], and she received the award for [[Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist|British Female Solo Artist]].
