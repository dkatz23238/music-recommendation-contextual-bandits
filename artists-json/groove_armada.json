The duo have released nine studio albums, four of which have charted in the [[UK Albums Chart]] top 50.\n\n== History ==\nGroove Armada formed after Cato and Findlay had been introduced by a mutual friend and soon started their own club night in London, called Captain Sensual at the Helm of the Groove Armada,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/20/groove-armada-how-we-made-at-the-river-tom-findlay-andy-cato |title=Groove Armada: how we made at the River |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=20 November 2018 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref> after a 1970s discoth\u00e8que.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nBy 1997 they had released a few singles, including \"4 Tune Cookie\" and the song that first brought them minor fame, \"[[At the River]]\", which sampled \"[[Old Cape Cod]]\" by [[Patti Page]]. The song went on to be one of Groove Armada's best-known tracks and has been found on numerous [[chillout music|chill out]] compilations.\n\nTheir first album, ''[[Northern Star (Groove Armada album)|Northern Star]]'', was released in 1998 on [[Tummy Touch Records]], and was followed by a second, ''[[Vertigo (Groove Armada album)|Vertigo]]'', in 1999, which had a more mainstream and 'polished' sound, making the UK Album Chart's upper 20 and being certified silver in the UK.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} It also included \"At the River\" which was re-released as a full-fledged single. An album of remixed tracks from ''Vertigo'' entitled ''The Remixes'' followed in 2000, along with their contribution to the ''[[Back to Mine]]'' [[mix album]] series.\n\nThe next studio album ''[[Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)]]'' was released in 2001 and marked a departure from their trip-hop roots to more upbeat music \u2013 as demonstrated on the [[Grammy]]-nominated single \"[[Superstylin']]\". Another mix album followed, this time for the ''[[Another Late Night]]'' series, and in 2002, less than a year after ''Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)'', Groove Armada produced ''[[Lovebox (Groove Armada album)|Lovebox]]'', which included a variety of genres including [[Rock music|rock]], such as \"Madder\" and \"[[Purple Haze (Groove Armada song)|Purple Haze]]\",{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} while others were closer to the band's traditional [[house music|house]] and [[trip hop]] roots,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} such as the title track \"Lovebox\", and \"Remember\", with the latter containing vocals made up entirely of samples of [[Sandy Denny]]'s vocals for [[Fairport Convention]]. An additional bonus track was later released on their website entitled \"Fairport\".{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Lovebox also contained a song called \"Hands of Time\" which was subsequently used in the 2004 film ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]''.\n\nA [[greatest hits album]], entitled ''[[The Best of Groove Armada]]'', released in 2004 \u2013 the last of their releases with Pepper Records \u2013 before their studio album ''[[Soundboy Rock]]'' was released in 2007. The album marked a notable departure from the multi-genre-influenced previous album, featuring tracks such as \"Get Down\" and \"Groove Extracts\", which followed the contemporary [[house music]] trend, tracks with [[rock music|rock]] elements, and \"Song 4 Mutya (Out of Control)\" featuring the vocals of ex-[[Sugababes]] singer [[Mutya Buena]], hailed by online music guide [[Popjustice]] as one of the best songs of 2007.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nFollowing the successful ''Soundboy Rock'' singles, an updated best-of set titled ''Greatest Hits'' was released in October 2007. This was accompanied by ''GA10: 10 Year Story'', a 2CD rarities collection released in November 2007 to celebrate their tenth anniversary as a band. The band has spoken in-depth about the compilation, and cited it as an \"emotional experience\", with both members selecting their personal favourite songs and mixes from their history.<ref>[http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms:/out/music/video_interviews/groove_armada_10_year_interview ''Groove Armada: 10 Year Story'' video interview] with [[stv.tv]]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131235020/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms%3A%2Fout%2Fmusic%2Fvideo_interviews%2Fgroove_armada_10_year_interview |date=31 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nGroove Armada also released a collaboration{{which|date=September 2011}} with [[The Japanese Popstars]] through [[Strictly Rhythm]], via [[Beatport]], in April 2008.\n\nIn the same year, Groove Armada engaged in a deal with [[Bacardi]] to distribute their new 4-track [[Extended play|EP]] using a [[file sharing]] platform called B-Live Share.\n\nDuring 2009, Findlay and Cato repeatedly confirmed the existence of a pending new album.
