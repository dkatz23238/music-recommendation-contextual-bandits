In addition to their melodic metal music, Lordi are also known for wearing monster masks and using horror elements with [[pyrotechnics]] during concerts and music videos. The band rose to fame in 2002 with their hit single \"[[Would You Love a Monsterman?]]\", and won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]] with their song \"[[Hard Rock Hallelujah]]\".\n\nLordi has toured and recorded actively since 2002, and Mr Lordi upgrades the band's costumes and masks for each album. The band has gone through several line-up changes with Mr Lordi being the only consistent member of the band since their foundation. Members of Lordi have stated their desire for their unmasked faces to remain private. However, they have made a number of unmasked appearances in several news outlets.<ref>\"Eurovision winners struggle to keep true identities secret\", ''The Irish Examiner'', 23 May 2006.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation (1992\u20132002)===\nLordi was formed in 1992 as a solo project by [[Mr Lordi]]. Lordi's very first demo album [[Lordi discography|Napalm Market]] was done in 1993. The album included a song \"Inferno\", which also got a music video, all done by Mr Lordi. In the music video Mr Lordi performed unmasked but he had made monster make-up for his friends who played secondary role in the video. After the video was done, Mr Lordi got an idea of a band of monsters. \"Inferno\" was later released in Finnish \"Rockmurskaa\" compilation album in 1995. In 1996 Mr Lordi organized a Kiss cruise for Finnish Kiss fans from Finland to Sweden. During the cruise he met musicians [[Amen (musician)|Amen]] and G-Stealer, and told them about his music project called Lordi. After the cruise they joined the band. One year later [[Erna Siikavirta|Enary]] joined the band on keyboard and the band recorded their first album, ''[[Bend Over And Pray The Lord]]''. At the time when the album was recorded, the band didn't have a drummer and they used MIDI drum tracks in place of a real drummer.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" />\n\nAri Tiainen, the owner of their record company, had originally planned to publish the album; however, the company did not have sufficient resources to market it. Tiainen recommended Lordi to the record label Kimmo Hirvonen's Records, owned by Anaconda. The album was planned to release in early 1999, but Anaconda Records went bankrupt shortly before the planned release date and the album was never released.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" />\n\nThe band never performed with the original line-up, though they had been promised a record release gig in 1999. During the same year G-Stealer left the band because of work commitments and was replaced by Magnum, whom Mr Lordi had met via Kiss Army Finland. In 2000, drummer [[Sampsa Astala|Kita]] joined and the band got their first drummer.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\">{{cite book|last      = Ahlroth|first     = Jussi|title     = Mie oon Lordi|publisher = Johnny Kniga|location  = Juva|year      = 2006|isbn      = 951-0-32584-8}}</ref>\n\n===''Get Heavy'' and success in Europe (2002\u20132004)===\nAfter several failed attempts at obtaining a recording contract, Lordi signed a record deal with [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] (BMG) Finland in 2002. In July, the band released their first official single, \"[[Would You Love A Monsterman?]]\", which rose to number one in Finland<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" /> and spawned a music video. During the summer the band went under the auspices of producer TT Oksala's Finnvox Studios to record their first official album,<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" /> though debut recording ran into several problems.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" />\n\nIn autumn 2002, bassist Magnum was fired and replaced by Kalma. Though Lordi's debut album had already been recorded when Kalma joined, he appeared in the album art and the composition of the accounts. Their debut album ''[[Get Heavy]]'' was released in November, with a cover design loosely based on [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'s ''[[Love Gun]]'' album. The original first sketch of the cover was based on [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'s ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' album. The album won the 2003 Emma award for best domestic hard rock or heavy metal album, and ''Get Heavy'' has sold more than 67,000 copies. It was certified platinum in Finland in 2003 and multi-platinum in 2006.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" />\n\nLordi played their first gig on 8 December 2002, in [[Helsinki]] at the Nosturi Club.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" /> In 2003, Lordi appeared at several music events in Finland and abroad, especially in Germany, where they played as a part of the Wacken Road Show. During some of the Germany tour, Lordi played as [[Nightwish]]'s support act. The tour boosted both bands' popularity in Germany and helped them sign a recording contract with the German record company Drakkar. Nightwish had already achieved solid success of joint concerts in Germany and Lordi also raised their profile in Germany.\n\n===''The Monsterican Dream'' (2004\u20132006)===\n[[File:LordiMoscow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Lordi performing live in 2005]]\nAt the beginning of 2004, Lordi began recording their second studio album. This time the album was produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa, with whom the band got along well. This second album was first released on 14 April 2004 as ''[[The Monsterican Dream]]''. Two songs from the album, \"My Heaven is Your Hell\" and \"[[Blood Red Sandman]]\", had been released as singles. Corresponding with the release of the album, the band's costumes and image were also reformed. The special edition of the album also contained a DVD of the band's own short film, ''The Kin''. The film, despite the success of the album it was attached to, has been poorly received. The album went gold two years after release.\n\nIn February 2005 Lordi's first compilation album ''The Monster Show'' was released by Sanctuary Records. Sanctuary had originally intended to market a collection of records in the United States, but these plans were halted due to financial problems. Sanctuary, however, published a compilation album in the UK. In Finland, a collection was published by Sony BMG.\n\nThe idea of ''The Monster Show'' disc collection has its roots in spring 2004, around the release of ''The Monsterican Dream'' album. Mr Lordi, while interviewing the band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] for Inferno magazine, gave the band's bassist/vocalist, [[Gene Simmons]], a copy of Lordi's debut album, ''[[Get Heavy]]'' (2002). Later, Simmons' assistant announced that Simmons would be willing to publish Lordi's albums in the United States, but if the band would like to share sales revenue, it would be better to publish with Sanctuary Records. Sanctuary did not want to publish either of the studio albums individually, and instead preferred a compilation of the best songs. Thus, songs were picked from ''Get Heavy'' and ''The Monsterican Dream'', and collected in the compilation album ''The Monster Show''. The collection was published in the spring of 2005 during the European Monstour.\n\nMeanwhile, the internal atmosphere of the band increased in intensity and led to a dispute between members. Later that year, bassist Kalma wanted to resign because of family and financial problems. [[Mr Lordi]], tried to persuade Kalma to stay, suggested that he just play the biggest tours and other contractually obligated performances. Kalma, however, did not relent, because he wanted to be involved with the band either in full or not at all. Kalma did, however, play the bass units for the future ''[[The Arockalypse]]'' album. Kalma left the band just before Lordi entered the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] qualifier.\n\nTwo new members joined the band, bassist OX and keyboardist [[Leena Peisa|Awa]]. This change in members spawned more alterations to the band's costumes.<ref>{{cite web |title=LORDI Introduce New Members |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/lordi-introduce-new-members/ |website=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=31 March 2021 |date=2 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n===''The Arockalypse'' and Eurovision (2006\u20132008)===\nLordi's third album ''[[The Arockalypse]]'' was released on 1 May 2006. On 20 May 2006, Lordi made history by winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|Eurovision Song Contest]] held in Athens with the song \"[[Hard Rock Hallelujah]]\", becoming the first Finnish group to win the contest and consequently the first rock/metal act to win;<ref name=\"lordieuro20061\">{{cite news |title=Oh Lordi, Finland win songfest |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0wzAAAAIBAJ&dq=lordi+hard+rock&pg=PA25&article_id=1686,4558081 |access-date=4 July 2022 |issue=51162 |publisher=The Nation |date=22 May 2006 |page=7A |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"lordieuro20062\">{{cite news |last1=Huuhtanen |first1=Matti |title=Good 'Lordi!' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0wzAAAAIBAJ&dq=lordi+hard+rock&pg=PA29&article_id=894,6264505 |access-date=4 July 2022 |issue=51170 |publisher=The Nation |date=30 May 2006 |page=15A |language=en}}</ref> Finland would then send power metal band Ter\u00e4sbetoni in 2008. The song scored 292 points, which was then an all-time points record. [[Pasi Rantanen]] from the band [[Thunderstone (band)|Thunderstone]] performed backing vocals, wearing a [[Gene Simmons]] Kiss mask.\n\nLordi opened the fall of 2006 Bringing Back the Balls to Europe tour; the concert DVD was released in February 2007 as ''Bringing Back the Balls to Stockholm 2006''. The tour ended with a surprise: during the last gig in London, 31 October, the band's former bassist, [[Niko Hurme|Kalma]], was seen as a guest on stage.\n\nIn November 2006, Lordi headlined the MTV Europe Music Awards, and Mr Lordi presented the \"Best Rock\" award. Around the same time, [[Bill Aucoin]], best known as the original manager of Kiss, became Lordi's manager.<ref>{{cite web |title=Original KISS Manager BILL AUCOIN To Work With LORDI? |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/original-kiss-manager-bill-aucoin-to-work-with-lordi/ |website=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=31 March 2021 |date=14 October 2006}}</ref> In spring 2007, Lordi created the Bringing Back the Balls tour, which toured in Japan and the Baltic countries. In May, the band was involved in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] held in [[Helsinki]], and opened the competition with their winning song \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\".\n\nIn early summer 2007 in Oulu, the members of Lordi participated in filming of the horror film ''[[Dark Floors]]'', which premiered on 8 February 2008. In July 2007, Lordi toured [[North America]] with the [[Ozzfest]] festival,<ref>{{cite web |title=LORDI Frontman: \"Ozzfest Has Been Absolutely Amazing For Us\" |url=https://bravewords.com/news/lordi-frontman-ozzfest-has-been-absolutely-amazing-for-us |website=BraveWords |access-date=31 March 2021 |language=en}}</ref> but ended up cancelling off-date shows during that tour.<ref>{{cite web |title=LORDI Cancel Off-Date North American Shows |url=https://bravewords.com/news/lordi-cancel-off-date-north-american-shows |website=BraveWords |access-date=31 March 2021 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Ozzfest tour ended in late August, Lordi went on a short break.

The band's horror-related albums, the monster costumes worn by all band members, and the horror elements of their performances are hallmarks of [[shock rock]]. The band was mostly influenced by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], but also by [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Twisted Sister]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Titus |first1=Christa |title=Monsters of Rock: Eurovision Song Contest Winner Lordi Sinks Its Metal Fangs Into America |magazine=Billboard |date=3 March 2007 |volume=119 |issue=9 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRMEAAAAMBAJ&dq=lordi+shock+rock&pg=PA42 |access-date=5 July 2022 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |language=en |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the band is often perceived by the media as a heavy metal band due to their monster costumes, their musical style has more characteristics of the hard rock genre. Over the years, the band's musical style has taken a very varied direction between hard rock and metal, with the pattern seeming as though it changes between the two with every album released. Their debut album, ''[[Get Heavy]]'', represented a large part of traditional hard rock music, but by the release of their ''[[The Monsterican Dream]]'' album in 2004, the band had shifted considerably toward heavier music and horror effects were prominently displayed. However, in their 2006 album ''[[The Arockalypse]]'', Lordi shifted back toward hard rock, eschewing horror themes and special effects. Their 2008 studio album, ''[[Deadache]]'', included more typical horror elements, leaning once again toward the heavier side of the spectrum. ''[[Babez for Breakfast]]'' saw the band once again shift back to the traditional hard rock elements, with an even greater exposure to the 1980s than the band's previous albums. ''[[To Beast or Not to Beast]]'' focuses completely on heavy metal, and was the band's heaviest album. Their 2014 album, ''[[Scare Force One]]'', contains elements of heavy metal while still maintaining the melodic rhythm of hard rock. The band's 2016 album, ''[[Monstereophonic (Theaterror vs. Demonarchy)|Monstereophonic]]'', is a \"split album\" consisting of two parts. Part one of the album (''Theaterror'') contains hard rock, while part two (''Demonarchy'') is [[Concept album|conceptual]], and much more [[progressive metal|progressive]] than any of Lordi's earlier content.\n\n===Costumes and masks===\n[[File:Lordi-Toulouse.jpg|thumb|Lordi performing live with pyrotechnics]]\nLordi members have stated that their costumes were inspired by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and the [[horror film|horror]] genre. Mr Lordi himself has said that without Kiss, Lordi probably would not exist.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" /> The monster masks and costumes the band use are made of [[foam latex]], with some other materials like canvas, metal and leather.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" /> The masks and costumes of Lordi are all and always made by Mr Lordi himself.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" /> As a professional make-up artist and sculptor, Mr Lordi has the necessary knowledge to produce those things easily. The band members do each other's makeup. The band updates their outfits and masks for each new album.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" />\n\nIt takes the other band members about one hour to put their masks and costumes on, though it takes Mr Lordi two to three hours to put on his.<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" /> He has also said that the materials for suits costs \"a few hundred euros\".<ref name=\"mieoonlordi\" />\n\nThe monster costumes are such an integral part of Lordi's publicity image that they refuse to be photographed or even interviewed without them, even if in some cases it leads to their own discomfort. Lordi has done interviews without their masks but the interviews are always filmed from the back so that their faces are not visible. Previously during interviews, Lordi members spoke only English to the cameras, not their native Finnish. In a brief segment on the [[BBC]] reporting about the band attending the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]], they were shown lounging beside a pool in full sunlight, while wearing their monster costumes.\n\n===Stage show===\n[[File:Lordi and Awa.jpg|thumb|left|Lordi's public appearances always include the full costumes.]]\nPyrotechnics, and horror elements are important parts of Lordi's stage show, designed and mostly created by Mr Lordi. Lordi's pyrotechnics are inspired by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], while the horror elements are largely derived from horror movies with some influence from [[Alice Cooper]]. Their stage platform is also equipped with monster actors, zombies, dolls, tricks, and sometimes stage dancers. Mr Lordi is also known to use a two-headed axe.\n\nIn 2009 the band made some new special effects with big help from [[Weta Workshop]] of New Zealand. The workshop has also designed scenery for movies such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[30 Days of Night (film)|30 Days of Night]]''.\n\n====Unmasked by the media====\nDespite the band's strict approach in relation to their costumes, multiple newspapers have published unlicensed photos of the band members without makeup. On 15 March 2006, the Finnish tabloid ''[[Ilta-Sanomat]]'' published a photograph of Mr Lordi in civilian clothing, with his face partially showing.\n\nOn 24 May 2006, the Finnish tabloid magazine ''{{lang|fi|[[7 P\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4]]}}'' (Seven&nbsp;Days) published an old picture of Mr Lordi's face on the front page, and two days later another tabloid, ''[[Katso!]]'' (\"Look!\"), published unmasked pictures of the other four band members.<ref>Salonen, Ilpo, \"Fury after magazine unmasks Lordi\", [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5034874.stm ''BBC News'']</ref> Both magazines were heavily criticised by their readers for publishing these pictures, which led to swift apologies from both magazines and promises not to publish unmasked pictures of Lordi any more.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Lordi+fans+furious+at+outing+by+gossip+magazine/1135220038344 |title=Helsingin Sanomat - International Edition - Culture |publisher=Hs.fi |access-date=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601064556/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Lordi+fans+furious+at+outing+by+gossip+magazine/1135220038344 |archive-date=1 June 2008 }}</ref> On 26 May 2006, video footage was shown on television in Lithuania.
