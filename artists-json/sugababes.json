The lineup changed three times before returning to the original lineup in 2011.\n\nFormed in 1998 by [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]] manager Ron Tom, Sugababes released their debut album ''[[One Touch (Sugababes album)|One Touch]]'' through [[London Records]] in November 2000, which achieved moderate success and produced the top-ten single \"[[Overload (Sugababes song)|Overload]]\". In 2001, Donaghy departed the group and was replaced by [[Heidi Range]]. With Range's introduction, the group experienced a higher level of commercial success and went on to release three [[Music recording certification|multi-platinum]] albums: ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces (Sugababes album)|Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (2002), ''[[Three (Sugababes album)|Three]]'' (2003) and ''[[Taller in More Ways]]'' (2005). In December 2005, Buena left the group and was replaced by [[Amelle Berrabah]]. Following the release of their [[Overloaded: The Singles Collection|first greatest hits album]], the new line-up released two further studio albums: ''[[Change (Sugababes album)|Change]]'' (2007) and ''[[Catfights and Spotlights]]'' (2008).\n\nIn September 2009, after 11 years in Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by [[Jade Ewen]]. Range, Berrabah and Ewen released the group's seventh studio album, ''[[Sweet 7]]'' (2010), after which they signed to [[RCA Records]], before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2011. That year, the original lineup reformed as '''Mutya Keisha Siobhan''' and released the single \"[[Flatline (Mutya Keisha Siobhan song)|Flatline]]\". The trio regained the name Sugababes in 2019, and recorded a rendition of the song \"[[Flowers (Sweet Female Attitude song)|Flowers]]\" with [[DJ Spoony]]. In 2021, the Sugababes re-released their debut album ''One Touch'' in honor of the album's 20th anniversary, with plans for new music.\n\nSugababes have achieved six number-one singles: \"[[Freak like Me#Sugababes version|Freak like Me]]\", \"[[Round Round]]\", \"[[Hole in the Head]]\", \"[[Push the Button (Sugababes song)|Push the Button]]\", \"[[Walk This Way#Sugababes vs. Girls Aloud version|Walk This Way]]\" and \"[[About You Now]]\"; the [[Spice Girls]] are the only British girl group to have had more. They have also released five UK top ten albums, four of which were certified Platinum in the UK, and have been nominated for six [[Brit Awards]], winning for [[Brit Award for British Dance Act|Best British Dance Act]] in 2003. They have been a long-term fixture in the British tabloids due to their several line-up changes and alleged group infighting.\n\n==History==\n===1998\u20132001: Formation, ''One Touch'' and Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy's departure ===\nSugababes were formed in 1998 by [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]] manager Ron Tom and Sarah Stennett,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Raphael|first=Amy|date=21 June 2003|title=Amy Raphael talks to Siobhan Donaghy|work=The Observer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/jun/22/featuresreview.review|access-date=19 July 2020|issn=0029-7712|archive-date=6 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706215025/https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/jun/22/featuresreview.review|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|date=12 June 2014|title=Iggy Azalea, Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding's Turn First Mgmt Company Run By 'Lionesses'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles//6121099/iggy-azalea-rita-ora-ellie-gouldings-turn-first-mgmt|access-date=19 July 2020|magazine=Billboard|archive-date=22 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922191229/https://www.billboard.com/articles//6121099/iggy-azalea-rita-ora-ellie-gouldings-turn-first-mgmt|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[First Access Entertainment]].
