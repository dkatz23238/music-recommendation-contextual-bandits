But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I'm writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it has more to do with the fact that just what's been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision.\"<ref name=\"shavemagazine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/interview-death-cab-for-cutie/5 |title=Interview: Death Cab for Cutie |work=[[Shave (magazine)|Shave Magazine]] |first=Bobby |last=Gorman |access-date=June 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Band name ==\nGibbard took the band name from the song \"[[Death Cab for Cutie (song)|Death Cab for Cutie]]\", which was written by [[Neil Innes]] and [[Vivian Stanshall]] and recorded by their group the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]]. The song is a track on the Bonzo's 1967 debut album, ''[[Gorilla (Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band album)|Gorilla]]'', and was performed by them in the Beatles film ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. The title was originally that of a story in an old [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction crime magazine]] that Innes came across in a street market. In a 2011 interview, Gibbard stated, \"The name was never supposed to be something that someone was going to reference 15 years on.
