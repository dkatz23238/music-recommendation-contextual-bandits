She can produce a pop, contemporary sound, but she can also blossom out into a [[light lyric soprano]]. The soprano part of her voice can go up to a F6 above her known E6. She doesn't sing it full out, but it is there. Of course, she has to dance while she is singing some of the time, so it's all the more extraordinary.<ref name=\"chin\"/></blockquote>\n\nShe sometimes uses her pop and classical voices in the same song. One example is \"Anytime, Anywhere\" from ''Eden'', a song based on [[Albinoni]]'s [[Adagio in G minor]]. In the song, she starts out in classical voice, switches to pop voice temporarily, and finishes with her classical voice. Another example is heard in the [[Lions Gate]] film ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'', during the songs \"Chase The Morning\" and \"Chromaggia\" by her character, Blind Mag.\n\nBrightman's music is generally classified as classical crossover. According to [[Manhattan Records]] GM Ian Ralfini, she is largely responsible for the popularity of the genre. In a 2000 interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', Brightman dismissed the classical crossover label as \"horrible\" but stated she understood people's need to categorise music.<ref>Charaipotra, Sona.
