They established themselves as part of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement of the early 1980s.\n\nThe band's greatest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their first album, 1980's ''[[On Through the Night]]'', reached the Top 15 in the UK but received little notice elsewhere.  Their second album, 1981's ''[[High 'n' Dry]]'', was produced by [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange|Mutt Lange]], who helped them begin to define their melodic hard rock style, and the album's most popular track \"[[Bringin' On the Heartbreak]]\" became one of the first rock videos played on [[MTV]] in 1982, but the album only reached the Top 30 and 40 in the UK and US. Def Leppard's next studio album, ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'', was released in January 1983, with \"[[Photograph (Def Leppard song)|Photograph]]\" and \"[[Rock of Ages (Def Leppard song)|Rock of Ages]]\" both topping the US Rock Tracks chart and reaching the top 20 of the Hot 100. Reaching No. 2 on the US album chart, ''Pyromania'' was certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] in the US and 7\u00d7 platinum in Canada and reached the top 20 in the UK but did not sell much elsewhere.\n\nDef Leppard's fourth album, the more pop-oriented ''[[Hysteria (Def Leppard album)|Hysteria]]'' (1987), topped the UK, US, New Zealand, Canadian, Australian and Norway charts. It also went to No. 2 in Sweden and No. 10 in Germany without any Top 50 singles in those countries. It has been certified 12\u00d7 platinum for sales in the US and 13\u00d7 platinum in Canada, selling over 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time.<ref name=erg>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/music/news/article.cfm?c_id=264&objectid=10539947&pnum=0 |title=One giant Leppard |last=Kara |first= Scott |date=30 October 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> The album spawned six Top 20 US singles, including the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] No. 1 \"[[Love Bites (Def Leppard song)|Love Bites]]\" (went Top 10 in several other countries including No. 2 in NZ), alongside \"[[Pour Some Sugar on Me]]\" (US No. 2), \"[[Hysteria (Def Leppard song)|Hysteria]]\", \"[[Armageddon It]]\" (No. 2 in NZ), \"[[Animal (Def Leppard song)|Animal]]\" (at No. 6, the biggest UK hit), and \"[[Rocket (Def Leppard song)|Rocket]]\" (a Top 15 hit in many countries). ''Hysteria'' had four Top 10 hits in New Zealand.\n\nTheir next studio album, ''[[Adrenalize]]'' (their first following the death of guitarist [[Steve Clark]]), reached No. 1 on the UK, US, NZ, Canadian and Australian charts in 1992, while going Top 10 in Sweden and Germany. It contained several hits, including the US Rock Tracks chart-topper, \"[[Let's Get Rocked]]\", which became their biggest hit in several countries, including No. 2 in the UK, No. 3 in Canada and Switzerland, and the Top 20 in Sweden and Germany. The third single, \"[[Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad]]\", was a Top 15 song in the US, UK and Canada. ''Adrenalize'' went on to sell over 8 million copies worldwide. Their 1993 album, ''[[Retro Active]]'', contained the [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] Top 5 North American hit \"[[Two Steps Behind]]\". Their greatest hits album ''[[Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits (1980\u20131995)|Vault]]'', released in 1995, featured the UK No. 2 hit \"[[When Love & Hate Collide]]\" and reached the Top 10 in several countries, going 5\u00d7 platinum in the US.  Beginning with ''[[Slang (album)|Slang]]'', Def Leppard released five albums between 1996 and 2008, with most usually reaching the Top 15 in several countries, including the UK, US and Canada.  Their self-titled album was released in 2015 and reached the Top 10 in several countries.

The residency, referred to as Viva! Hysteria, featured a two-part show, with the first half featuring Def Leppard opening for themselves, under the alias \"Ded Flatbird\", (jokingly called the best Def Leppard cover band in the world), when they played songs they very rarely play live, going all the way back to \"Good Morning Freedom\", a B-side from the single \"Hello America\" released in February 1980, an era usually left untouched by the band. The opening set varied each night, from playing the best hits from albums like ''On Through the Night'', ''Slang'', and ''Euphoria'', to being the entire first half of ''High 'n' Dry''. The second half, and \"main event\" was Def Leppard, as themselves playing their best-selling album, ''Hysteria'', from start to finish. A live album, also titled ''[[Viva!
