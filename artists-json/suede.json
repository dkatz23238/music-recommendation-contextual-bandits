Splits from thick hides of cow and deer are also sueded, but, due to the fiber content, have a shaggy nap. \n\n==Characteristics==\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2021}}\nBecause suede does not include the tough exterior skin layer, it is less durable, but softer, than the standard \"full-grain\" leather. Its softness, thinness, and pliability make it suitable for clothing and delicate uses; suede was originally used for women's [[gloves]], hence its etymology (see above). Suede leather is also popular in [[upholstery]], [[shoe]]s, [[handbag|bags]], and other accessories, and as a [[lining (sewing)|lining]] for other leather products. Due to its textured nature and open pores, suede may become dirty and quickly absorb liquids.\n\n== Sueded fabrics==\nFabric sueding is carried out on a sueding machine with abrasive covered rollers; the machines can suede both sides of fabric, whether woven or knitted.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_textile-manufacturer-knitting-world_1977_1|title=Textile Manufacturer & Knitting World 1977: Iss 1|date=1977|publisher=Textile Manufacturer|others=Internet Archive|pages=19|language=English}}</ref> Creasing and variations in the center selvedge are two major concerns with sueded fabrics.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_textile-technology-digest_1996-06_53|title=Textile Technology Digest 1996-06: Vol 53|date=1996|publisher=Textile Information Center|others=Internet Archive|pages=62|language=English}}</ref> Fabrics that have been sueded or emerized are known as 'sueded fabrics' or 'emerized fabrics.' <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Definition of SUEDE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/suede|access-date=2021-08-03|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Sueding ===\nSueding is a [[Chemical finishing of textiles#Mechanical finishes|mechanical finishing process]] that exposes the material to an abrasive surface, creating a small, soft pile.
