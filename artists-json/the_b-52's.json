The band also added various members for albums and live performances.\n\nThe group evoked a \"thrift shop aesthetic\", in Bernard Gendron's words,<ref name=trash>{{cite book |last1=Gendron |first1=Bernard |title=Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde |date=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago |page=289}}</ref> by drawing from 1950s and 1960s pop sources, [[trash culture]], and rock and roll. Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson sometimes use [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]]-style vocals (Schneider's often humorous [[sprechgesang]] contrasting with Wilson's and Pierson's melodic harmonies), and their guitar- and keyboard-driven instrumentation is their trademark sound, which was also set apart from their contemporaries by the unusual guitar tunings Ricky Wilson<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\"/> used on their earlier albums. The band has had many hits, including \"[[Rock Lobster]]\", \"[[Planet Claire]]\", \"[[Party Out of Bounds]]\", \"[[Private Idaho]]\", \"[[Whammy Kiss]]\", \"[[Summer of Love (The B-52's song)|Summer of Love]]\", \"[[Wig (song)|Wig]]\", \"[[Love Shack]]\", \"[[Roam]]\" and \"[[Meet_the_Flintstones#The_B-52's_cover|(Meet) The Flintstones]]\".

In the dream, he heard someone whisper in his ear that the band's name was the B-52's.\n\nThe band's quirky take on the new wave sound of its era was a combination of [[dance music|dance]] and [[surf music]] set apart from their contemporaries by the unusual guitar tunings Ricky Wilson<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\"/> used and [[Thrift store chic|thrift-store chic]].\n\nThe band's first single, \"[[Rock Lobster]]\", recorded for [[DB Records]] in 1978, was an underground success,<ref name=\"USA\"/> selling over 2,000 copies,<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\"/> that led to gigs at [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]].<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\"/> Both this version of \"Rock Lobster\" and its B-side, \"52 Girls\", are different recordings from those that appear on the band's 1979 debut album, and the early version of \"52 Girls\" is in a different key.\n\nThe rerecorded version of \"Rock Lobster\" was also released as a single and in the UK and Germany was backed with an instrumental version of \"Running Around\", a non-album track at the time. (A vocal rerecording of this appears on the band's second album, 1980's ''[[Wild Planet]]''.) The buzz the record created in the UK meant their first show in London at the [[Electric Ballroom]] was packed and attended by UK pop stars, including [[Sandie Shaw]], [[Green Gartside]] from [[Scritti Politti]], and [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]]. In Canada, released on the [[Warner Bros.

Several of the songs on the new album had been concert staples since 1978; the band consciously did not record them for its first album since it already had too many tracks and wanted a strong second album, knowing that its live performances would make fans look forward to it. [[Rhett Davies]] co-produced the album, which had a more polished production sound than the debut.\n\nReleased on August 27, 1980, ''[[Wild Planet]]'' was well received by critics; many fans{{Who|date=February 2021}} consider it the band's best album. It reached No. 18 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in 1980<ref>{{cite web |website=[[AllMusic]] |title=Wild Planet > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums |year=2006 |access-date=May 10, 2010 |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1074|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref> and was certified gold; \"[[Private Idaho (song)|Private Idaho]]\" became the band's second Hot 100 entry. The B-52's performed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on January 26, 1980, and at the [[Heatwave (festival)|Heatwave]] festival (promoted as the \"New Wave Woodstock\") in Toronto, Canada, in August 1980. The band also appeared in the [[Paul Simon]] film ''[[One-Trick Pony (film)|One Trick Pony]]''. In July 1981, ''[[Party Mix!]]'' was released, a six-song collection containing songs from the first two albums remixed and sequenced to form two long tracks, one on each side.\n\nIn 1981, the band collaborated with [[Talking Heads]]' [[David Byrne]] to produce a third full-length studio album. Reportedly due to differences with Byrne over the album's musical direction, recording sessions for the album were aborted, prompting the band to release ''[[Mesopotamia (EP)|Mesopotamia]]'' in 1982 as an [[extended play|EP]]. (In 1991, ''Party Mix!'' and ''Mesopotamia'', the latter of which had been remixed, were combined and released together on a single [[compact disc]].) Also in 1982, the band appeared at the inaugural [[US Festival]], performing on the first day.\n\n===1982\u20131987: ''Whammy!'', ''Bouncing off the Satellites'', and death of Ricky Wilson===\nIn December 1982, the band began recording their third album, ''[[Whammy!]]''. According to Pierson, Strickland no longer wanted to play the drums, so the band switched to [[drum machine]]s for this album, with Strickland and Ricky Wilson playing all the music on the album, and the rest of the band providing vocals only. Having originally played guitars, organ, bass guitar and synthesizers, Pierson switched to a mainly vocal role in the studio, but remained behind the keyboards on tour. The band also began experimenting heavily with [[synthesizer]]s during this period.\n\nReleased on April 27, 1983, ''Whammy!'' reached No. 29 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name=\"r1077\">{{cite web |website=[[AllMusic]]|title=Whammy! > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums |year=2006 |access-date=May 10, 2010 |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1077|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref> \"[[Legal Tender (song)|Legal Tender]]\" reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, as well as the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play Singles]] chart alongside \"[[Whammy Kiss]]\" and \"[[Song for a Future Generation]]\".<ref name=\"r1077\"/> For the ''Whammy!'' tour, some tracks featured Strickland on the drums while others used a backing track so Strickland could come forward and play other parts.

Later during the year the band struggled to write new material for their next album. The band members all lived together in the same house and felt that collaboration was not working, so they decided to try to write songs separately and began recording in July 1985, again using drum machines and synthesizers extensively.

In the 1990s, former [[Duran Duran]] drummer [[Sterling Campbell]] joined the band, but left in 2000 to tour with [[David Bowie]] and was replaced that year by [[Zack Alford]], who had recorded and toured with the band during the ''Cosmic Thing'' era. Pierson and Cindy Wilson recorded a cover of the [[McFadden & Whitehead]] song \"[[Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now]]\" for the 1996 film ''[[The Associate (1996 film)|The Associate]]'', starring Whoopi Goldberg; Wilson rejoined the B-52's the same year.\n\nA career retrospective, ''[[Time Capsule: Songs for a Future Generation]]'', appeared in 1998, along with two remixed maxi-singles: \"Summer of Love '98\" and \"Hallucinating Pluto\". A major tour (with co-headliners [[the Pretenders]]) to promote the collection took place. \"[[Debbie (song)|Debbie]]\", another single from the album (a tribute to [[Blondie (band)|Blondie's]] [[Debbie Harry]]), placed No. 35 on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s Hot Modern Rock Tracks.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1998-06-27/alternative-songs |title=Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks Chart Listing For The Week Of June 27, 1998 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=January 2, 2013 |access-date=August 12, 2016}}</ref> In 1999, they recorded a parody of \"Love Shack\" called \"Glove Slap\" for an [[E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)|episode]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

The [[Irving Plaza]] show in [[New York City]] featured Yoko Ono, as well as [[Tina Weymouth]] and [[Chris Frantz]] of [[Talking Heads]], as guests, with [[Chicks on Speed]] as the opener.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.apeculture.com/music/b52s.htm|title= The B-52s 25th Anniversary Concert with Chicks on Speed|last=Wiskirchen|first=Julie|publisher=Ape Culture|access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Coinciding with the band's 25th anniversary was the publication of ''The B-52's Universe: The Essential Guide to the World's Greatest Party Band'', the first and only officially authorized biography of the band.

The B-52's recorded the song \"Orange You Glad It's Summer\" for a [[Target Corporation|Target]] commercial that aired in spring/summer 2002. Target also used the ''Cosmic Thing'' song \"Junebug\" in a TV spot five years later.\n\nIn late 2004, the band opened for [[Cher]] on a few dates of her [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour|Farewell Tour]]. In March 2006, they opened for [[The Rolling Stones]] at a benefit for the [[Robin Hood Foundation]]. They had three remix EPs released by Planet Clique: ''Whammy!'' in 2005, ''Mesopotamia'' in 2006, and ''Wild Planet'' in 2007.
