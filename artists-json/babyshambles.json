The band was formed by [[Pete Doherty]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) during a hiatus from [[the Libertines]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Babyshambles - Artist Profile|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/647-babyshambles|access-date=15 June 2020|website=eventseeker.com|language=en}}</ref> As of 2013 the band includes [[Mick Whitnall]] (lead guitar), [[Drew McConnell]] (bass guitar, backing vocals) and [[Adam Ficek]] (drums, percussion). Babyshambles have released three albums\u2014''[[Down in Albion]]'' (2005), ''[[Shotter's Nation]]'' (2007) and ''[[Sequel to the Prequel]]'' (2013)\u2014three [[Extended play|EPs]] and a number of [[Single (music)|single]]s.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history and touring (2003&ndash;2005)===\nIn mid-2003, [[Pete Doherty]] was banned from playing with [[the Libertines]] until he could overcome his substance abuse problems. As a response, Doherty formed an alternative band, and recruited former Libertine Steve Bedlow as vocalist. Initially, Doherty planned on calling his new band T'Libertines, because of the band's Yorkshire connection \u2013 the line-up of the band at the time consisted mainly of Yorkshiremen.\nOn the night Babyshambles' first gig was scheduled to take place, Doherty was arrested for burgling [[Carl Bar\u00e2t]]'s flat. After he was charged and released, his friend Dean Fragile organized a new gig at the Tap'n'Tin. The performance received mixed reviews.\n\nDoherty was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for his crime. His sentence was later reduced on appeal to two months. When he was released from prison, Doherty rejoined The Libertines<ref name=\"RejoinLibs\">{{cite news\n | title=Libertines reunite at freedom gig\n | date=9 October 2003\n | access-date=2007-07-24\n | work=[[BBC News]]\n | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3178394.stm\n}}</ref> and sidelined the Babyshambles project. However, he found time to record the band's first single, \"[[Babyshambles (song)|Babyshambles]]\", which was released in April 2004 on High Society Records. The artwork was by Sophie Thunder. The single was limited to 2000 CDs and 1000 7\" vinyl copies.<ref name=\"FirstSingle\">{{cite web\n | title=WHAT A SHAMBLES, BABY!\n | date=26 March 2004\n | access-date=2007-07-24\n | work=[[NME]]\n | url=http://www.nme.com/news/107965.htm\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220022900/http://www.nme.com/news/107965.htm\n | archive-date=20 February 2006\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the early summer of 2004, Doherty once again found himself cast out of The Libertines because of his drug use.<ref name=\"Libswhithoutpete\">{{cite web\n | title=LIBS CONTINUE WITHOUT PETE\n | date=30 June 2004\n | access-date=2007-07-24\n | work=[[NME]]\n | url=http://www.nme.com/news/109000.htm\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220023012/http://www.nme.com/news/109000.htm\n | archive-date=20 February 2006\n}}</ref> As a result, Doherty brought Babyshambles to the fore with [[Patrick Walden]] on guitar, [[Gemma Clarke]] on drums and [[Peter Perrett]]'s two sons, Jamie and Peter Junior, on guitar and bass respectively. Doherty organised several gigs and the band began to gain respect in their own right, even though Doherty missed a number of appearances. The band's lineup underwent several changes before stabilizing during the late summer of 2004 with Doherty on vocals, Patrick Walden on guitar, Gemma Clarke on drums and [[Drew McConnell]] on bass.\n\nIn September and October 2004, Babyshambles embarked on a British tour that culminated with two shows at the London [[Scala (club)|Scala]]. Despite fears that Doherty's performance would not be consistent, the tour sold out and received critical acclaim. The band's second single, \"[[Killamangiro]]\", was released 29 November 2004 on [[Rough Trade Records]], reaching number 8 on the [[UK singles chart]]. The band embarked on another tour in December 2004, among growing concerns regarding Doherty's drug dependence.
