They were active from 1989 to 1998, and again from 2013 to 2015. The band's music featured a deliberately [[lo-fi music|low-quality]] sound, influenced by [[indie rock]] and [[psychedelic folk]]. Mangum wrote surreal and opaque lyrics that covered a wide range of topics, including love, spirituality, nostalgia, sex, and loneliness. He and the other band members played a variety of instruments, including non-traditional rock instruments like the [[singing saw]], [[uilleann pipes]], and [[Casio digital horn|Digital Horn]].\n\nNeutral Milk Hotel began as one of Mangum's [[home recording]] projects. In 1994, he released the song \"[[Everything Is (song)|Everything Is]]\" on [[Cher Doll Records]]. The song's exposure convinced him to record more music under this name. In 1996, he worked with childhood friend [[Robert Schneider]] to record the album ''[[On Avery Island]]'', which received modest reviews and sold around 5,000 copies. Mangum recruited musicians [[Julian Koster]], [[Jeremy Barnes (musician)|Jeremy Barnes]], and [[Scott Spillane]] for the band's second album, ''[[In the Aeroplane Over the Sea]]''. Its 1998 release received mostly positive but not laudatory reviews.\n\nWhile on tour, the band's popularity grew through Internet exposure. This had a negative effect on Mangum, whose mental health began to deteriorate. He did not want to continue touring and Neutral Milk Hotel went on hiatus shortly after. During the hiatus, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a [[cult following]] and the critical standing of ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' rose tremendously. Several music outlets such as ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' called ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' a landmark album for indie rock and one of the greatest albums of the 1990s. Many indie rock groups such as [[Arcade Fire]] and [[the Decemberists]] were influenced by Neutral Milk Hotel's eclectic music and earnest lyrics. Neutral Milk Hotel reunited in 2013 and undertook a reunion tour before another hiatus in 2015.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nNeutral Milk Hotel originated in [[Ruston, Louisiana]], in the late 1980s, as one of the many [[home recording]] projects of musician [[Jeff Mangum]].{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 3 (Search phrase \"Jeff recorded in Ruston under the name Milk, etching the name into the plastic of the cassettes he made for friends\")}} The project was initially called Milk, and Mangum made the recordings in high school.{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 3 (Search phrase \"Jeff recorded in Ruston under the name Milk, etching the name into the plastic of the cassettes he made for friends\")}} Early Milk recordings such as ''Invent Yourself a Shortcake'' and ''Beauty'' were circulated between Mangum and his friends [[Robert Schneider]], [[Bill Doss]], and [[Will Cullen Hart]].<ref>{{harvnb|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 3 (Search phrase \"They started making twenty-minute tapes for their friends\")}}; {{harvnb|Cooper|2005|p=9}}.</ref> The constant stream of home recording [[cassette tape]]s the group made would eventually lead to the formation of a [[musical collective]] known as [[Elephant 6]].{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=8\u20139}} They were not interested in trying to promote their music to record labels, and instead made the recordings for each other and their classmates.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=94}} When Mangum learned of another band called Milk, he changed the name of the project to Neutral Milk Hotel, based on a name Hart had suggested.<ref>{{harvnb|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 7 (Search phrase \"And Will named Neutral Milk Hotel\"); {{harvnb|Cooper|2005|p=9}}}}.</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Mangum attended [[Louisiana Tech University]], but dropped out.{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 3 (Search phrase \"Jeff dropped out of Louisiana Tech after a couple of years\")}} He moved to [[Athens, Georgia]], and played in a band called [[The Olivia Tremor Control|Synthetic Flying Machine]] with Doss and Hart, but left shortly after the band was formed.{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 7 (Search phrase \"As a trio, they performed as Synthetic Flying Machine\")}}{{efn|Doss and Hart would change the name of the band from Synthetic Flying Machine to the Olivia Tremor Control after Mangum left.{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 7 (Search phrase \"Even with Jeff off to Seattle again, Will and Bill wanted to stick with what they had started\")}}}} He then became a vagabond, and lived in cities such as [[Denver]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Seattle]].{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=95}} Mangum occasionally recorded music during this period, including a 1993 [[Demo (music)|demo]] album titled ''Hype City Soundtrack''.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=95}} Schneider says ''Hype City Soundtrack'' was a reaction to what Mangum believed was the rampant commercialization of music within large cities.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=95}} While living in Seattle, Mangum overcame his apprehensiveness about the music industry and released the song \"[[Everything Is (song)|Everything Is]]\" on [[Cher Doll Records]].{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=96}} The song's exposure convinced Mangum to record more music under the name Neutral Milk Hotel.{{sfn|McMullen|1996}} According to Mangum: \"The single was a godsend because I was pretty much at the end of my rope with just about everything in my life at that point{{nbsp}}... I ended up sending a tape to [Nancy Ostrander] at Cher Doll Records and she saved me merely by saying she wanted to do a single.\"{{sfn|McMullen|1996}}\n\nAt the time, Mangum was also a bass guitarist for [[the Apples in Stereo]], a band that Schneider formed while living in Denver.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=96}} The members of the Apples in Stereo wanted to sign with [[SpinART Records]], and met with their legal representative, Brian McPherson, in Los Angeles.<ref>{{harvnb|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Gage|2011}}.</ref> McPherson was drawn to Mangum, who was wearing a [[Shrimper Records]] T-shirt.{{sfn|Gage|2011}} After learning that Mangum wrote \"Everything Is\", a song that McPherson had previously listened to and enjoyed, the two worked out an agreement for McPherson to become Neutral Milk Hotel's representative.{{sfn|Gage|2011}} McPherson sent copies of \"Everything Is\" and another song \"Ruby-Bulbs\" to [[Merge Records]] founders [[Laura Ballance]] and [[Mac McCaughan]].{{sfn|Gage|2011}} The two liked the music, and added Neutral Milk Hotel to their roster.{{sfn|Gage|2011}}{{efn|Neutral Milk Hotel did not sign a [[recording contract]] with Merge, as the label operated on a \"handshake basis.\"{{sfn|Caney|2009}} When a band was added to Merge's roster, the two parties would split profits in exchange for promotion from the label.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=52}}}}\n\n===''On Avery Island'' and expansion to a quartet===\n[[File:Jeff Mangum at the Atomic Music Hall, Athens, GA, circa 1997 (1296808020).jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a man holding a guitar with a microphone nearby|[[Jeff Mangum]] performing with Neutral Milk Hotel in 1997]]\nMangum moved to Denver to record the first Neutral Milk Hotel album, ''[[On Avery Island]]''.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=97}} Schneider served as the [[Record producer|producer]], and the recording sessions lasted from February to May 1995.{{sfn|Anon.|1996a}} Although Schneider was interested in an expansive [[Beatlesque]] production, he aligned with Mangum's preference for a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] sound, admitting that \"at first it was frustrating, but I came to enjoy it. That's how I learned to produce, doing that record, because I totally had to let go of what I thought it should be like.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=26}} ''On Avery Island'' was released in the United States on March 26, 1996, by Merge Records, and in the United Kingdom on September 30, 1996, by [[Fire Records (UK)|Fire Records]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anon.|1996b|p=56}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}.</ref> It sold around 5,000 copies, which Merge considered a success.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=37}} ''On Avery Island'' received positive reviews from critics, who characterized the music as lo-fi pop.<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|2005|p=37}}; {{harvnb|Goldsmith|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Wolff|1996}}.</ref> Kurt Wolff of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' described listening to the music as \"a trippy experience,\" and ultimately called the album \"a fresh, exciting standout.\"{{sfn|Wolff|1996}} The British publication ''[[NME]]'' wrote: \"Neutral Milk Hotel can convert miserable-as-sin introspection into folky mantras that bore into your skull like a well-aimed power drill.\"{{sfn|Goldsmith|n.d.}} ''On Avery Island'' was ranked at number thirty-five on ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Pazz & Jop]] poll for 1996.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=37}}\n\nAfter the release of ''On Avery Island'', Mangum sought other musicians to tour with.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=98}} While living in Ruston, Mangum befriended New York musician [[Julian Koster]]. They exchanged demo tapes, and Koster joined Neutral Milk Hotel as the bassist.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=28}} Around this period, Koster received a letter from Chicago drummer [[Jeremy Barnes (musician)|Jeremy Barnes]], who wrote how he was not meeting the expectations he had set for himself.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=29}} According to Koster: \"Jeremy had written me this really wonderful letter, basically saying he was being led into a far different life than I think Jeremy Barnes was supposed to live ... I think he was sensing that his destiny lay elsewhere.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=29}} The letter resonated with Koster and Mangum, and they traveled to Chicago to meet him. After a short audition, the two persuaded Barnes to drop out of [[DePaul University]] and join the band.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=29}} The final band member came when Mangum was traveling to New York City to live with Koster. On a stop in [[Austin, Texas]], Mangum met former Rustonian musician [[Scott Spillane]], who was working at a pizza shop. Mangum helped make pizzas during the late-night \"drunk rush\", after which he convinced Spillane to join the band.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=31}}\n\nThe band members moved to New York City, and lived and rehearsed in a house owned by Koster's grandmother.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=98}} Koster encouraged the band members to play instruments outside their comfort zones.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=33}} For example, drummer Barnes learned to play the accordion, and Spillane learned how to play the horn parts from ''On Avery Island'', practicing on a two-valve horn for hours every day.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|pp=33\u201334}} On April 28, 1997, Neutral Milk Hotel began a national tour, during which the band members learned to play as a unit.{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 11 (Search phrase \"The first Neutral Milk Hotel gig with this lineup took place at Brownies, a skinny, sweltering little bar in the East Village, on April 28, 1997\")}} The ''On Avery Island'' tour generated enough money for the band members to afford to move to Athens, where a large group of Elephant 6 musicians were living.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=99}} By the spring of 1997, Mangum had written and demoed nearly every song for a second album. He shared the demos with his bandmates before they moved to Denver to record the album.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=52}}\n\n===''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''===\nNeutral Milk Hotel's second album, ''[[In the Aeroplane Over the Sea]]'', was produced by Schneider, and was recorded from July to September 1997.{{sfn|Anon.|1998}} Schneider used new recording techniques to capture Mangum's lo-fi preferences.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|pp=56\u201357}} Mangum liked having a layer of [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] over the music, but Schneider did not use standard effects equipment such as [[Big Muff]]s or [[Effects unit|distortion pedals]].{{sfn|Cooper|2005|pp=57\u201358}} Instead, Schneider used heavy [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and placed a Bellari RP-220 tube mic [[Preamplifier|pre-amp]] close to Mangum's guitar. Schneider then ran the sound through a [[mixing console]], and maxed out the sound on a cassette tape.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=58}} This process was done for nearly every instrument used on ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''. Schneider claimed that the nonlinearities of microphone distortion gave the album its unique \"warm\" quality.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=57}}\n\n''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' was released on February 10, 1998.{{sfn|DeVille|2018}} Merge pressed 5,500 CD and 1,600 vinyl copies, and expected sales to be similar to ''On Avery Island''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=100}}; {{harvnb|McGoven|2013}}.</ref> These initial projections were correct, as the album sold moderately well for the first few months.{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=100}} Critical responses to ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' were mostly positive, but not laudatory.{{sfn|Winkie|2016}} Rob Brunner of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the unique instrumentation and \"bouncy pop melodies\", but described some of the songs as \"lifeless acoustic warblers.\"{{sfn|Brunner|1998}} ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'s}} M. Christian McDermott also commended the music, which he called a blend of \"''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' with early 90s lo-fi\" that he found \"as catchy as it is frightening.\"{{sfn|McDermott|n.d.}} A more negative review came from [[Ben Ratliff]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', who felt the heavy layer of distortion masked the absence of decent melodies.{{sfn|Ratliff|1998}} ''[[CMJ|CMJ New Music Monthly]]'' ranked ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' as the number one album of 1998,{{sfn|Anon.|1999a|p=3}} and it placed fifteenth in the Pazz & Jop poll for 1998.{{sfn|Anon.|1999b}}\n\nTo promote the album, Neutral Milk Hotel embarked on a tour of North America and Europe.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=85\u201387}} Musicians [[John Fernandes]] and Will Westbrook were brought on as touring members, and were taught how to play the horn parts with Spillane.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=85}} While on tour, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a reputation for chaotic and physically demanding concerts. [[Great Lakes (band)|Great Lakes]] member Ben Crum recalled: \"It was definitely dangerous. There often seemed to be a very real chance that someone, probably Julian, would get hurt. Jeff was always doing things like picking him up and throwing him into the drums.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=84}} The band members often could not afford lodgings, and sometimes asked people in the audience if they could spend the night at their house, not realizing the homeowner was in fact terrified of them.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n===Hiatus and cult following===\nSome journalists have noted the release of ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' coincided with the rise of the Internet.<ref>{{harvnb|Milton|2016}}; {{harvnb|Winkie|2016}}.</ref> The album, and by extension Neutral Milk Hotel, became common fixtures on online [[Internet forum|message boards]], and early music websites like ''Pitchfork'' gave the band an increased level of promotion.{{sfn|Milton|2016}} Their newfound high profile had a negative effect on Mangum, and his mental health began to deteriorate.{{sfn|Clark|2008}} He constantly told his bandmates that he wanted to quit, but never explained why.{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 17 (Search phrase \"Jeff was constantly talking about dropping out\")}} Some journalists have speculated he became tired of touring and constantly explaining his lyrics to fans; Elephant 6 biographer Adam Clair believes he may have been overwhelmed by the way fans viewed his music, and the high expectations placed upon any subsequent recordings.{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapters 19 (Search phrase \"He rejects the idea that it had anything to do with pressure from the success of Aeroplane or the increased attention he was receiving\") and 32 (Search phrase \"He may have also been a victim of his own success\")}} Regardless of the reason, Mangum came to the conclusion that he could not continue performing, and instead wanted to disappear from the public eye.{{sfn|Clark|2008}} Instead of telling the other band members of his decision, he simply avoided the topic of new music altogether. This led to the unofficial breakup of Neutral Milk Hotel shortly after the tour.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=98}} The final Neutral Milk Hotel live performance occurred on October 13, 1998, in [[London]].{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 1 (Search phrase \"The last true Neutral Milk Hotel show of 1998 was on October 13, in London\")}}\n\nDuring the hiatus, Mangum occasionally worked on some projects, but nothing was widely publicized.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=100}} When asked about a third Neutral Milk Hotel album in a 2002 interview, Mangum said: \"I don't know. It would be nice, but sometimes I kind of doubt it.\"{{sfn|Fierman|2002}} Although Neutral Milk Hotel did not officially break up, the other band members worked on music with other Elephant 6 bands such as [[Bablicon]], [[the Gerbils]], [[A Hawk and a Hacksaw]], and [[the Music Tapes]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brady|2011}}; {{harvnb|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 1 (Search phrase \"His bandmates all pursued other projects they'd started before joining Neutral Milk Hotel\")}}.</ref> Koster notes how he and the other band members initially thought the hiatus would be a short break to focus on their other musical projects. Koster recounted: \"The fact that Neutral Milk wasn't doing something just felt natural, because so much else was happening, and we had just done so much. It didn\u2019t feel unusual at all. I suspected nothing.\"{{sfn|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 17 (Search phrase \"I was excited about everything because it seemed like a really exciting time)\"}}\n\nFans of Neutral Milk Hotel were not told why the band went on hiatus. Some were angry, and accused Mangum of being selfish, and others wrote hoax blog posts giving fake details of upcoming tours and other false information.{{sfn|Clark|2008}} The speculation and online discussions raised the profile of the band, to the point that Neutral Milk Hotel and, in particular, ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' gained a [[cult following]] and converted Mangum into a larger-than-life figure.{{sfn|Winkie|2016}} In 2003, ''[[Creative Loafing (Atlanta)|Creative Loafing]]'' writer Kevin Griffis dedicated an entire cover story to trying to track down Mangum for personal closure. The search ended when Mangum sent him an email that read: \"I'm not an idea. I am a person, who obviously wants to be left alone.\"{{sfn|Ballance|Cook|McCaughan|2009|p=104}} Journalist Mark Richardson attempted to explain ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''{{'s}} rise in popularity: \"Because [Mangum] was inaccessible, there was no outlet for connection other than the record itself and other fans who shared a passion. By doing nothing, Neutral Milk Hotel developed a cult.\"{{sfn|Richardson|2018}}\n\n''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''{{'s}} critical standing rose tremendously in the years after its release, which journalist Luke Winkie attributes to the cult following.{{sfn|Winkie|2016}} [[Domino Recording Company]] released a [[reissue]] in 2005, which was awarded a perfect 10/10 score by Mark Richardson of ''Pitchfork''.{{sfn|Richardson|2005}} Richardson wrote: \"It's a record of images, associations, and threads; no single word describes it so well as the beautiful and overused kaleidoscope.\"{{sfn|Richardson|2005}} Other music outlets such as [[AllMusic]] and the ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]'' also gave the album perfect scores.<ref>{{harvnb|Ankeny|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Larkin|2009}}.</ref> ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''{{'s}} sales figures increased during the 2000s, with an estimated 140,000 copies sold by 2005.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=100}} ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' writer Garrett Martin noted how fans of the album were \"incredibly passionate\", recording [[cover version|covers]] for [[YouTube]], writing poetry, and forming [[tribute act|tribute band]]s.{{sfn|Martin|2013}} Martin said: \"The fanbase might be relatively small, but it's fervent.\"{{sfn|Martin|2013}}\n\n===Reunion===\n[[File:Jeff Mangum in 2014.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a man holding a guitar with a microphone nearby|Jeff Mangum performing on the Neutral Milk Hotel reunion tour in 2014]]\nMangum resurfaced in 2008 with a few solo shows, before embarking on full solo tours in 2011 and 2012.<ref>{{harvnb|Clair|2022|loc=Chapter 30 (Search phrase \"Jeff made his return to the stage playing \"Engine\" at six of the Holiday Surprise shows in October 2008\")}}; {{harvnb|Minsker|2013}}.</ref> During this time, Mangum curated a [[box set]] of Neutral Milk Hotel material, which included an [[extended play]] of unreleased songs titled ''[[Ferris Wheel on Fire]]''.{{sfn|Richardson|2012}} As Mangum was active again within the music industry, rumors began spreading among fans and music outlets of a potential Neutral Milk Hotel reunion.<ref>{{harvnb|Brady|2011}}; {{harvnb|Pelly|2012}}.</ref>\n\nOn April 29, 2013, Neutral Milk Hotel officially announced a reunion tour with all four members of the band.{{sfn|Minsker|2013}} In an interview with ''[[Orlando Weekly]]'', Schneider said: \"[The hiatus] certainly wasn't purposeful, and I'm not sure [Mangum] even realized he was being a recluse until it was overwhelmingly the case that everyone was talking about it. I've known for seven years that he was going to start touring.

For example, \"Song Against Sex\" was written as a reaction to the use of sex as a source of power in a relationship.{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=541}} A central lyrical topic in ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' is the life of [[Anne Frank]], a teenage girl who died in a [[Nazi concentration camp]].{{sfn|DeVille|2018}} Tracks such as \"[[Holland, 1945]]\" and \"Ghost\" incorporate elements of Frank's life into the lyrics.
