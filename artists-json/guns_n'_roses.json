When they signed to [[Geffen Records]] in 1986, the band comprised vocalist [[Axl Rose]], lead guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], rhythm guitarist [[Izzy Stradlin]], bassist [[Duff McKagan]], and drummer [[Steven Adler]]. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, guitarist [[Richard Fortus]], drummer [[Frank Ferrer]] and keyboardists [[Dizzy Reed]] and [[Melissa Reese]].\n\nGuns N' Roses' debut album, ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] a year after its release, on the strength of the top 10 singles \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\", \"[[Paradise City]]\", and \"[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]\", the band's only single to reach number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the country's bestselling debut album and [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|eleventh-bestselling album]]. Their next studio album, ''[[G N' R Lies]]'' (1988), reached number two on the ''Billboard'' 200, sold ten million copies worldwide (including five million in the U.S.), and included the top 5 hit \"[[Patience (Guns N' Roses song)|Patience]]\". ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]'', recorded simultaneously and released in 1991, debuted at number two and number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide (including 14 million units in the U.S.). The ''Illusion'' albums included the lead single \"[[You Could Be Mine]]\", covers of \"[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]\" and \"[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]\", and a trilogy of ballads (\"[[Don't Cry]]\", \"[[November Rain]]\", and \"[[Estranged (song)|Estranged]]\"), which featured [[List of most expensive music videos|notably high-budget music videos]]. The records were supported by the [[Use Your Illusion Tour]], a world tour that lasted from 1991 to 1993. The covers album ''[[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]]'' (1993) was the last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan before their initial departure.\n\nWork on a follow-up album stalled due to creative differences between band members; by 1998 only Rose and Reed remained from the ''Illusion''-era lineup. Rose, wanting to expand the band's sound with [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] elements, enrolled an eclectic lineup of musicians, including punk bassist [[Tommy Stinson]], virtuoso guitarist [[Buckethead]], synth player [[Chris Pitman]] and several touring members of [[Nine Inch Nails]], among others. After a decade of work, Guns N' Roses's long-awaited sixth studio album, ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' (2008), was released, featuring the [[Chinese Democracy (song)|title track]] as lead single. At an estimated $14 million in production costs, it is the most expensive rock album in history. It debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200, but undersold industry expectations despite a mostly positive critical reception. Following the expansive [[Chinese Democracy Tour]], Slash and McKagan rejoined the band in 2016 for the [[Not in This Lifetime... Tour]], which became the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|third-highest-grossing concert tour on record]], grossing over $584 million by its conclusion in 2019.\n\nIn their early years, the band's hedonism and rebelliousness drew comparisons to the early [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] and earned them the nickname \"the most dangerous band in the world\". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer [[Matt Sorum]], was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012, its first year of eligibility. Guns N' Roses have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 45 million in the United States, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling acts in history]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1985\u20131986)===\n{{main|Hollywood Rose|L.A.
