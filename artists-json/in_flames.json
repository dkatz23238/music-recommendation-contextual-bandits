Alongside [[At the Gates]] and [[Dark Tranquillity]], In Flames pioneered the genres known as [[Swedish death metal]] and [[melodic death metal]].\n\nDuring the band's early years, In Flames had a varying group of musicians recording with them, including many [[session musician]]s. By the release of ''[[Colony (In Flames album)|Colony]]'' (1999), the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album ''[[Reroute to Remain]]'' (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to [[alternative metal]]. This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales. As of 2008, In Flames has sold over two million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/14997.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141741/http://www.livedaily.com/news/14997.html|archive-date=16 December 2008|title=In Flames finds 'A Sense of Purpose' in North America|last=Kilgore|first=Kym|date=6 October 2008|publisher=[[LiveDaily]]|access-date=26 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nSince the band's inception, In Flames have released thirteen [[studio album]]s, three [[Extended play|EPs]], and two live DVDs, their latest release being their thirteenth studio album ''[[I, the Mask]]'' in 2019. In Flames has been nominated for three [[Grammis Awards]].

However, since the band only has two guitar players, they found it hard to reproduce those songs during live performances and ever since ''[[Reroute to Remain]]'' they have focused on writing songs with the intention of playing them live. On the album ''[[Soundtrack to Your Escape]]'', the band focused on less guitar melodies, giving place for more synths.
