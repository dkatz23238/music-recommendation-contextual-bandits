Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her [[Mariah Carey (album)|eponymous debut album]]. She was the first artist to have her first five singles reach number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], from \"[[Vision of Love]]\" to \"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\".\n\nCarey's debut album was released under the guidance of [[Columbia Records]] executive [[Tommy Mottola]], whom she married three years later. Carey achieved further success with the albums ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' (1994), and ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995), with singles including \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\", \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]\", \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\", \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\", \"[[Always Be My Baby]]\", and \"[[One Sweet Day]]\", which topped the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of the 1990s|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 decade-end chart (1990s)]]. After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] with ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997). ''Billboard'' named her the [[Billboard Decade-End#1990s|Artist of the Decade]] (1990s), while the [[World Music Awards]] honored her as the best-selling female pop-artist of the millennium.\n\nIn 2001, after eleven consecutive years of U.S. number-one singles, Carey left Columbia and signed a $100 million record deal with [[Virgin Records]]. Following her [[Glitter (soundtrack)#Controversies|highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown]] and the failure of her film ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001) and [[Glitter (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]], Virgin bought her contract for $28 million and the following year she signed with [[Island Records]]. After a relatively unsuccessful period, Carey returned with ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005), which became the best-selling album in the US and the world's second best-selling album of 2005. Its second single, \"[[We Belong Together]]\", topped the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of the 2000s|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 decade-end chart (2000s)]]. She won the Breakthrough Actress Performance award at the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]] for her role in the 2009 film ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]''. Carey's next ventures included being an ''[[American Idol]]'' judge, starring in the docu-series ''[[Mariah's World]]'', appearing in the films ''[[The Butler]]'' (2013), ''[[A Christmas Melody]]'' (2015), and ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017), and publishing her 2020 memoir ''[[The Meaning of Mariah Carey]]''.\n\nCarey is regarded as one of the most celebrated singer-songwriters of [[1990s in music|her generation]] and is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], with sales of over 220 million records worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mariah Carey |url=https://www.songhall.org/profile/mariah_carey |access-date=August 31, 2022 |agency=Songwriters Hall of Fame}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Alvarez |first=Lauren |title=Why Doesn't Mariah Carey Get The Songwriting Credit She Deserves? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenalvarez/2020/09/27/why-doesnt-mariah-carey-get-the-songwriting-credit-she-deserves/ |access-date=August 31, 2022 |magazine=Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Marshell |first=Kyla |date=September 29, 2020 |title=Getting to the Meaning of Mariah Carey |url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2020/9/29/21493233/mariah-carey-unified-theory-the-meaning-of-mariah |access-date=August 31, 2022 |agency=The Ringer}}</ref> She holds the record for the most ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one singles by [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles|a solo artist]] (19), [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Songwriters with the most number-one singles|a female songwriter]] (18), and a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Producers with the most number-one singles|female producer]] (15).<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=December 16, 2019|title=Wish Come True: Mariah Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' Hits No. 1 on Hot 100 After 25-Year Wait|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546418/mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-number-one|magazine=Billboard|access-date=December 16, 2019}}</ref> Carey is the [[List of highest-certified music artists in the United States|highest-certified female artist]] in the United States and 11th overall, with 71 million [[RIAA certification|certified]] [[album-equivalent units|album units]].

While they lived in Huntington their neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car.<ref name=\"nick2\" /> After her parents' divorce Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family. Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three, often imitating her mother's take on [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Rigoletto]]'' in Italian. Her older sister Alison moved in with their father; Mariah and her elder brother Morgan lived with their mother.<ref name=\"nick3\" /><ref name=\"nick4\" />\n\nDuring her years in elementary school, she excelled in the arts, such as music and literature.

Though she was a classically trained opera singer, Patricia Carey never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera. Mariah Carey recalled that she had \"never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel.' I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me.\"<ref name=\"nick7\" /><ref name=\"nick8\" /> In high school Mariah Carey was often absent because of her work as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer; as a result her classmates gave her the nickname [[Mirage]].<ref name=\"nick8\" /> Her work in the Long Island music scene gave her opportunities to work with musicians such as [[Gavin Christopher]] and [[Ben Margulies]], with whom she co-wrote material for her demo tape. After moving to New York City she worked part-time jobs to pay the rent and completed 500 hours of [[Cosmetology|beauty school]].<ref name=\"nick9\" /> Carey moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, and shared it with four other female students.<ref name=\"nick10\" /> She landed a gig singing backup for [[freestyle music|freestyle]] singer [[Brenda K.
