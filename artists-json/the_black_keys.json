The group consists of [[Dan Auerbach]] ([[guitar]], [[Singing|vocals]]) and [[Patrick Carney]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]). The duo began as an [[Independent music|independent]] act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular [[garage rock]] artists during a [[Garage rock revival|second wave of the genre's revival]] in the [[2000s in music|2000s]]. The band's raw [[blues rock]] sound draws heavily from Auerbach's [[blues]] influences, including [[Junior Kimbrough]], [[R.L. Burnside]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], and [[Robert Johnson]].\n\nFriends since childhood, Auerbach and Carney founded the group after dropping out of college. After signing with [[Independent record label|indie label]] [[Alive Naturalsound Records|Alive]], they released their debut album, ''[[The Big Come Up]]'' (2002), which earned them a new deal with [[Fat Possum Records]]. Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and broad [[music licensing|licensing]] of their songs. Their third album, ''[[Rubber Factory]]'' (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band's profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo completed ''[[Attack & Release]]'' (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]], who subsequently became a frequent collaborator with the band.\n\nThe group's commercial breakthrough came in 2010 with ''[[Brothers (The Black Keys album)|Brothers]]'', which along with its popular single \"[[Tighten Up (The Black Keys song)|Tighten Up]]\", won three [[Grammy Awards]]. Their 2011 follow-up ''[[El Camino (The Black Keys album)|El Camino]]'' received strong reviews and peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, leading to the first arena concert tour of the band's career, the [[El Camino Tour]]. The album and its hit single \"[[Lonely Boy (The Black Keys song)|Lonely Boy]]\" won three Grammy Awards. In 2014, they released their eighth album, ''[[Turn Blue (album)|Turn Blue]]'', their first number-one record in the US, Canada, and Australia. After completing the Turn Blue Tour in 2015, the duo took a hiatus for several years to work on side projects and produce other artists. They returned in 2019 with their ninth album, ''[[Let's Rock (The Black Keys album)|Let's Rock]]''; their tenth studio album ''[[Delta Kream]]'' was released in 2021 and consists of [[hill country blues]] [[cover version|covers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/black-keys-delta-kream/|title=Black Keys Announce Blues Covers Album 'Delta Kream'|access-date=May 14, 2021|archive-date=May 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514154005/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/black-keys-delta-kream/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nGuitarist and vocalist [[Dan Auerbach]] and drummer [[Patrick Carney]] first met when they were eight or nine years old while living in the same neighborhood of [[Akron, Ohio]] a couple houses down from each other.<ref name=\"nymag\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2010/06/black_keys_drummer_patrick_car.html|title=Hilarious Black Keys Drummer Patrick Carney on Not Growing a Beard, Damon Dash, and Danger Mouse|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|publisher=New York Media LLC|first=Nishan|last=Gopalan|date=June 3, 2010|access-date=January 22, 2013|archive-date=October 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201302/http://www.vulture.com/2010/06/black_keys_drummer_patrick_car.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Auerbach and Carney both come from musical backgrounds.
