In 1970 he began to assemble the rock band [[Roxy Music]] with a group of friends and acquaintances in London, and took the role of lead singer and main songwriter. The band achieved immediate international success with the release of their eponymous debut album in 1972, containing a rich multitude of sounds, which reflected Ferry's interest in exploring different genres of music. Their second album, ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'' (1973), further cultivated the band's unique sound and visual image that would establish Ferry as a leading cultural icon over the next decade.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/bryan-ferry-the-life-and-loves-of-a-music-icon-30299362.html|title=Bryan Ferry: The life and loves of a music icon|newspaper=Belfasttelegraph|via=www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nFerry began a parallel solo career in 1973 by releasing ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'', which popularized for the first time the concept of a contemporary musician releasing an album covering [[traditional pop|standard songs]] and was a drastic departure from his ongoing work with Roxy Music.

the role of a live performer, reinventing himself in stage costumes ranging from [[gaucho]] to military uniforms.\n\nFerry disbanded Roxy Music following the release of their best-selling album ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' in 1982 to concentrate on his solo career, releasing further singles such as \"[[Slave to Love]]\" and \"[[Don't Stop the Dance]]\" and the UK no. 1 album
