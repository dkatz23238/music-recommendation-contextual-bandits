On one such performance, the group added a rap section they had written to one of Thirkell and Keiles' songs. Keiles was furious with the changes and insisted they learn to write songs properly. The group began professional songwriting lessons;<ref>{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997b|pp=86\u201390}}</ref> during one session, they wrote a song called \"Sugar and Spice\" with Hawes, which inspired them to change their band name to \"Spice\".<ref name=mcgibbon9798>{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997b|pp=97\u201398}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1994, the group felt insecure as they still did not have an official contract with Heart Management, and were frustrated with the management team's direction. They persuaded Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an \"overwhelmingly positive\" reaction.<ref name=\"sinclair20083334\" /> The Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them.

It was during these sessions that the songs \"[[Wannabe]]\" and \"[[2 Become 1]]\" were written.<ref name=\"sinclair4049\" />\n\nIn March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=34}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|According to Tim Hawes, Halliwell had tricked him into giving her the master tapes, claiming the group needed them for rehearsals.

Through contacts they had made at the showcase, they were also introduced to record producers [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]]. With Kennedy and Absolute's help, the group spent the next several weeks writing and recording demos for the majority of the songs that would be released on their debut album, including \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\" and \"[[Who Do You Think You Are (Spice Girls song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]\".<ref name=\"sinclair4049\">{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=40\u201349}}</ref> Their demos caught the attention of [[Simon Fuller]] of [[19 Entertainment]], who signed them to his management company in May 1995.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=66\u201368}}</ref>\n\nBy this point, industry buzz around Spice had grown significantly and the major record labels in London and Los Angeles were keen to sign them.

Apart from ease of administration, this was also a symbolic expression of the unity which was so much part and parcel of the Spice philosophy.<ref name=Sinclair20085152/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSinclair identified Halliwell as a major source of ideas for the Spice Girls' songs, including many of the concepts and starting points for the group's songs.<ref name=Sinclair20085354/> [[Tim Hawes]], who worked with the group when they were starting out, said Halliwell's strength was in writing lyrics and pop [[Hook (music)|hooks]], and estimated that she was responsible for 60\u201370% of the lyrics in the songs he worked on.<ref name=mcgibbon9798/> The group's collaborators credit the other members of the group as being more active than Halliwell in constructing the [[melodies]] and [[harmonies]] of their songs.<ref name=mcgibbon9798/><ref name=sinclair49/><ref name=Sinclair20085354/> Matt Rowe, who wrote several songs with the Spice Girls, agreed that Halliwell was particularly good when it came to writing lyrics and credits the lyrics for \"Viva Forever\" to her.

In the group's first ever interview in May 1996, Halliwell told ''Music Week'': \"We want to bring some of the glamour back to pop, like Madonna had when we were growing up. Pop is about fantasy and escapism, but there's so much bullshit around at the moment.\"<ref name=firstinterview/> The modern pop phenomenon that the Spice Girls created by targeting early [[Millennials]] was credited with changing the music landscape by reviving the pop music genre,<ref name=\"landscape\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/spice-girls-wannabe-was-number-1-20-years-ago-today__10051/|title=Spice Girls' Wannabe was Number 1 20 years ago today|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|last=Myers|first=Justin|date=5 July 2016|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/2021.02.17-171606/https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/spice-girls-wannabe-was-number-1-20-years-ago-today__10051/|archive-date=17 February 2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/53567/the-90s-ranked/|title=Every Year of the '90s Ranked According to Music|publisher=[[VH1]]|date=12 August 2014|first=Stacy|last=Lambe|access-date=3 March 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/2021.03.03-122014/http://www.vh1.com/news/53567/the-90s-ranked/|archive-date=3 March 2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Chuck|title=Britain's Spice Girls come to the rescue of ailing pop scene with the release of 'Spice'|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |date=15 February 1997|page=102}}</ref> bringing about the global wave of late-1990s and early-2000s [[teen pop]] acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[NSYNC]].<ref name=\"teen pop\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/teen-pop-ma0000002895|title=Teen Pop|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210219133844/https://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/teen-pop-ma0000002895|archive-date=19 February 2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"pop music\">{{Cite news|url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/p/teenpop.htm|title=Teen Pop|publisher=[[About.com]]|first=Bill|last=Lamb|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/2021.02.19-134348/https://www.liveabout.com/teen-pop-meaning-3246993|archive-date=19 February 2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"billboard wannabe video\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/pop-shop/girl-group-week/6070253/top-10-girl-group-music-videos|title=Top 10 Most Iconic Girl Group Music Videos: 'Waterfalls,' 'Wannabe' & More|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Unterberger|first=Andrew|date=4 March 2015|access-date=2 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/2021.02.19-144219/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/girl-group-week/6070253/top-10-girl-group-music-videos/|archive-date=19 February 2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"spice girls ruined 1990s\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/1990s-spice-girls-celebrity-culture|title=The 1990s were the best of times ... until the Spice Girls ruined everything|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Sylvia|last=Patterson|date=4 July 2016|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/2021.02.19-134750/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/1990s-spice-girls-celebrity-culture|archive-date=19 February 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Spice Girls have also been credited with paving the way for the [[girl groups]] and female pop singers that have come after them.<ref name=\"eonline\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/778200/the-spice-girls-wannabe-turns-20-today-20-ways-it-changed-pop-culture-forever|last=Rankin|first=Seija|title=The Spice Girls' \"Wannabe\" Turns 20 Today: 20 Ways It Changed Pop Culture Forever|work=[[E!

After a lunch with the Spice Girls in the wake of \"Wannabe{{\" '}}s release, Peter Loraine, the then-editor of ''[[Top of the Pops (magazine)|Top of the Pops]]'' magazine, and his editorial staff decided to devise nicknames for each member of the group based on their personalities. Loraine explained, \"In the magazine we used silly language and came up with nicknames all the time so it came naturally to give them names that would be used by the magazine and its readers; it was never meant to be adopted globally.\"<ref name=\"Intent Media\"/> Shortly after using the nicknames in a magazine feature on the group, Loraine received calls from other British media outlets requesting permission to use them, and before long the nicknames were synonymous with the Spice Girls.<ref name=\"Intent Media\">{{cite news|last1=Barrett|first1=Christopher|title=Spice Girls: From Wannabes to World Beaters|work=[[Music Week]]|date=10 November 2007|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/232226522/|issn=0265-1548|url-access=subscription|page=13|access-date=23 February 2021 |via=[[ProQuest]]}}</ref><ref name=\"girl power 3\"/> Jennifer Cawthron, one of the magazine's staff writers, explained how the nicknames were chosen:\n\n<blockquote>\nVictoria was 'Posh Spice', because she was wearing a [[Gucci]]-style mini dress and seemed pouty and reserved. Emma wore [[pigtail]]s and sucked a lollipop, so obviously she was 'Baby Spice'. Mel C spent the whole time leaping around in her [[tracksuit]], so we called her 'Sporty Spice'. I named Mel B 'Scary Spice' because she was so shouty. And Geri was 'Ginger Spice', simply because of her hair. Not much thought went into that one.<ref name=\"girl power 3\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn a 2020 interview, Chisholm explained that the Spice Girls' image came about unintentionally when, after initially trying to coordinate their outfits as was expected of girl groups at the time, the group decided to just dress in their own individual styles. According to Chisholm, they \"never thought too much more of it\" until after \"Wannabe\" was released and the press gave them their nicknames. The group embraced the nicknames and grew into caricatures of themselves, which Chisholm said was \"like a protection mechanism because it was like putting on this armour of being this, this character, rather than it actually being you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelovemagazine.co.uk/article/melanie-c-imagines-how-the-spice-girls-would-fare-in-2020|title=Melanie C Imagines How The Spice Girls Would Fare In 2020|work=[[Love (magazine)|Love]]|date=2 April 2020|first=Amelia|last=White|archive-url=https://archive.today/2021.03.14-085742/https://www.thelovemagazine.co.uk/article/melanie-c-imagines-how-the-spice-girls-would-fare-in-2020|archive-date=14 March 2021|access-date=14 March 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEach Spice Girl adopted a distinct, over-the-top [[trademark look|trademark style]] that served as an extension of her public [[persona]].<ref name=\"iconic looks\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sleek-mag.com/article/spice-girls-fashion|title=20 Years Later: How the Spice Girls' Fashion Transcended Time|work=Sleek Magazine|date= 12 July 2016|first=Gloria|last=Cardona|access-date=23 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127004556/https://www.sleek-mag.com/article/spice-girls-fashion/|archive-date=27 November 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Jennifer Grayer|year=2015|title=Fashion Fads Through American History: Fitting Clothes into Context|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood]]|chapter=Chapter 4: Living Out the Fantasy: Television, Music, and Movies Take to the Streets: Spice Girls Style (1996\u20131999)|pages=125\u2013127|isbn=9781610699020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Spicy spice girls (8089395518).jpg|thumb|Fans dressed up as the Spice Girls, replicating their [[signature look]]s.]]\n\n*[[Victoria Beckham]] (n\u00e9e Adams): As '''Posh Spice''', she was known for her choppy brunette [[bob cut]], reserved attitude, signature pout and form-fitting designer outfits (often a [[little black dress]]).<ref name=\"iconic looks\"/><ref name=\"posh spice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.girlfriend.com.au/article/celebs-celeb-goss-nina-dobrev-dressed-as-posh-spice-for-halloween-we-can't-even-tell-them-apart|title=Nina Dobrev Dressed As Posh Spice For Halloween & We Can't Even Tell Them Apart|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303151706/http://www.girlfriend.com.au/article/celebs-celeb-goss-nina-dobrev-dressed-as-posh-spice-for-halloween-we-can't-even-tell-them-apart |archive-date=3 March 2017|work=[[Girlfriend (magazine)|Girlfriend]]|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Mel B|Melanie Brown]]: As '''Scary Spice''', she was known for her \"in-your-face\" attitude,<ref>{{cite news|title=Mel B: 'I got used to lying.
