They were pioneers of the [[big beat]] genre and their music has appeared in numerous TV shows, films, video games, and advertisements. Their 1997 debut studio album ''[[Vegas (The Crystal Method album)|Vegas]]'' was [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] in 2007, and saw follow-ups ''[[Tweekend]]'', ''[[Legion of Boom (album)|Legion of Boom]]'', ''[[Divided by Night]]'', and ''[[The Crystal Method (album)|The Crystal Method]]''. In 2017, Ken Jordan retired from music and left the group, with Scott Kirkland adopting The Crystal Method as a solo moniker.<ref name=\"solo\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2009}}\nThe Crystal Method originally had two members, Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland. Before The Crystal Method was formed, Jordan and Kirkland started working on music while working at a grocery store. Jordan was also a local DJ in Las Vegas as well as the college radio program director at [[UNLV]]. Jordan taught Kirkland how to DJ, and when Jordan moved to Los Angeles to work for a producer, Kirkland took over his job DJing at the local club. Kirkland also moved out to Los Angeles, and they formed The Crystal Method in 1993.\n\nWhile working as a production duo for a rapper, a person named Crystal would handle transportation needs. The rapper repeatedly referred to her method of transportation as \"The Crystal Method.\" The pair adopted the name based on the layout of the three words and the sound of the name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/crystal-method-2018-interview-2604136815.html?rebelltitem=2|title=The Drive Inside: An Interview with the Crystal Method|date=2018-09-12|website=PopMatters|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Early days (1993\u20131995)===\nBy the early '90s, both Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland had moved from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Jordan and Kirkland bought a house together, in La Crescenta, [[Glendale, California]], which had a small underground shelter beneath the front lawn. Originally intending to turn the shelter into a studio, it proved to be an unrealistic idea and the duo set up a studio in their house which was located near a 210 Freeway overpass.<ref>\u201cIt was right on the 210 Freeway.

They were interviewed on the front lawn of the house in the documentary ''[[Better Living Through Circuitry]]''.\n\nAfter The Bomb Shelter was built, a tape of The Crystal Method's music found its way to British DJ Justin King. King was interested in starting a record label that would showcase American [[Electronic music|electronic]] [[Dance music|dance]] acts. Together with Steve Melrose, King formed the record label City of Angels Record Label. The first official release from the City of Angels label was The Crystal Method's \"Now is the Time\". The Crystal Method were signed to Outpost Recordings in 1996.\n\n===''Vegas'' (1996\u20131998)===\nAfter the band signed with Outpost, they began working on their debut album.
