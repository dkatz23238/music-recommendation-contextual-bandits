The group released the album ''[[The Invitation (Thirteen Senses album)|The Invitation]]'' on 27 September 2004, along with several singles: \"Thru the Glass\", \"Do No Wrong\", \"Into the Fire\" and \"The Salt Wound Routine\", of which the first three reached the top 40 of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Their second album, ''[[Contact (Thirteen Senses album)|Contact]]'', was released in April 2007. Thirteen Senses are the only Cornish band to have a top 20 single.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\n==History==\nThirteen Senses started out as Soul Magician, that began in school when Will South started writing songs which he showed Adam Wilson. He in turn liked the songs and left the other band he was in at the time. Soul Magician took off when South and Wilson met Tom Welham. The latter knew Brendon James and they all became friends.\n\nIn 2002 Soul Magician released an [[Extended play|EP]], ''Inside A Healing Mind'', which was [[record producer|produced]] by Leon Phillips. It consisted of four tracks, one of which was later released as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. \"Attracting Submission\" is found on the \"Do No Wrong\" [[Gramophone record|7\" vinyl]]. After that came in 2002 the ''No Other Life Is Attractive'' EP: the first Thirteen Senses release, produced by Dare Mason. This had five tracks. Four of them have been released as B-sides, the exception being \"Sound\". They then issued in 2003, ''Falls In The Dark'', a self-released and independent demo album.\n\nThe band's next release and major label debut album was ''The Invitation''. This consisted of twelve tracks and reached number 14 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited| location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 556}}</ref> on its re-release.\n\nAt the beginning of 2004, and before ''The Invitation'', Thirteen Senses released their first single, \"Thru the Glass\". This was released on both [[Compact disc|CD]] and 7\" vinyl. The B-side was identical on both releases: \"No Other Life Is Attractive\". Later, the next single was \"Do No Wrong\" and it reached number 38 in the official [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> To promote it, Thirteen Senses went on [[concert tour|tour]], including a homecoming [[concert|gig]] at the [[Hall for Cornwall]] in Truro.\n\nThe third single from the band was \"Into the Fire\". This was also released on two CDs and vinyl \"Into The Fire\" was used on [[BBC One]]'s ''[[Match of the Day]]''. After this came a re-release of \"Thru the Glass\" which broke the group into the UK Top 20.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nThe band toured both in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Europe]] in 2005 and made several appearances at festivals such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[T in the Park]] and [[V Festival]].\n\nThe band spent much of the latter part of 2005 and early 2006 in the [[recording studio]], working on their next album, ''[[Contact (Thirteen Senses album)|Contact]]''. It was released on 2 April 2007. It was originally planned to be released in February 2007 but after playing three pre-album gigs at The Luminaire in London (on the thirteenth of the months of October, November and December), the band produced new tracks. \"Talking to Sirens\", one of the new tracks from ''Contact'', was only played at the last gig. Due to the new album release date, their UK tour was rescheduled for March.\n\nOn 28 August 2007 Thirteen Senses announced through their website that they had begun recording their third album, and between April\u2013July 2008 they previewed samples of 8 [[Demo (music)|demo recordings]] on their [[MySpace]] page.<ref>[http://www.thirteensenses.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3428]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>  After several months without official contact from the band, on 28 May 2009, Brendon James announced that their third studio album was close to completion and it would, \"all being well, be released within the next 2\u20133 months\".<ref>[http://www.thirteensenses.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3436]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2010 the band made their third album ''Crystal Sounds'' available to stream on their website, thirteensenses.com. A day later they announced this on their MySpace page and said the album would be available to stream \"for a limited time\". The physical version of ''Crystal Sounds'' was released on 21 February 2011 with four tracks not featured on the early release.\n\nOn 27 February 2013, the band announced via [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] that \"work on a new album is reaching its conclusion... more news coming soon...!\"\n\nOn 6 February 2014, the band announced via Facebook and Twitter that their fourth album ''A Strange Encounter'' would be released on 5 May 2014.\n\n==Band members==\n* Will South \u2013 vocals, piano, guitar\n* Tom Welham \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\n* Adam Wilson \u2013 bass guitar\n* Brendon James \u2013 drums, percussion\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n*''[[The Invitation (Thirteen Senses album)|The Invitation]]'' (27 September 2004, [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]) #14 [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n*''[[Contact (Thirteen Senses album)|Contact]]'' (2 April 2007, Mercury) #76 UK\n*''[[Crystal Sounds]]'' (21 February 2011, B-Sirius)\n*''[[A Strange Encounter]]'' (5 May 2014, B-Sirius)\n\n===EPs and demo albums===\n*''Inside a Healing Mind'' EP (2002, as Soul Magician)\n*''No Other Life Is Attractive'' EP (December 2002)\n*''[[Falls in the Dark]]'' demo album (April 2003)\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of singles with selected chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| [[UK Singles Chart|UK]]<br /><ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Thru the Glass]]\"\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2004\n| \u2014\n| ''[[Falls in the Dark]]''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Do No Wrong]]\"\n| 38\n| rowspan=\"4\"| ''[[The Invitation (Thirteen Senses album)|The Invitation]]''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Into the Fire (Thirteen Senses song)|Into The Fire]]\"\n| 35\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Thru the Glass]]\"\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2005\n| 18\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"The Salt Wound Routine\"\n| 45\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"All the Love in Your Hands\"\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2007\n| 108\n| rowspan=\"2\"| ''[[Contact (Thirteen Senses album)|Contact]]''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Follow Me\"\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"The Loneliest Star\"\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2011\n| \u2014\n| rowspan=\"2\"| ''[[Crystal Sounds]]''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Home\"\n| \u2014\n|}\n\n==Music videos==\n*\"Thru the Glass\" [first version] (2004)\n*\"Do No Wrong\" (2004)\n*\"Into the Fire\" (2004)\n*\"Thru the Glass\" [second version] (2005)\n*\"Thru the Glass\" [alternative version] (2005)\n*\"The Salt Wound Routine\" (2005)\n*\"All the Love in Your Hands\" (2007)\n*\"Follow Me\" (2007)\n*\"The Loneliest Star\" (2011)\n*\"Home\" (2011)\n\n==Songs in other media==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;\"\n!
