Since 2005, the band's lineup has consisted of twin brothers [[Joel Madden]] (lead vocals) and [[Benji Madden]] (guitar and vocals), Paul Thomas (bass), [[Billy Martin (guitarist)|Billy Martin]] (guitar and keyboards), and Dean Butterworth (drums and percussion).\n\nThe band released their [[Good Charlotte (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 2000 to mostly positive reviews. In 2002, they achieved breakthrough success with their second album, ''[[The Young and the Hopeless]]''. Featuring the hit singles \"[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous (Good Charlotte song)|Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]\", \"[[The Anthem (Good Charlotte song)|The Anthem]]\" and \"[[Girls & Boys (Good Charlotte song)|Girls & Boys]]\", ''The Young and the Hopeless'' sold 3.5 million copies in the US and was certified triple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], for a total of almost 5 million copies sold worldwide. The band followed up with ''[[The Chronicles of Life and Death]]'' in 2004; a darker album, both musically and lyrically. Backed by the singles \"[[Predictable (Good Charlotte song)|Predictable]]\" and \"[[I Just Wanna Live]]\", ''The Chronicles of Life and Death'' continued the band's success, and the album was certified platinum by the RIAA, selling over one million copies in the US alone. In 2007, they released the [[dance-punk]] inspired album ''[[Good Morning Revival]]'' before going back to their [[pop punk]]-roots with the album ''[[Cardiology (album)|Cardiology]]'' in 2010. After a four-year-long hiatus, the band announced its comeback on November 3, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcharlotte.com/post/132474098862/httpwwwaltpresscomnewsentrygoodcharlottea |title=Good Charlotte |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222134656/http://goodcharlotte.com/post/132474098862/httpwwwaltpresscomnewsentrygoodcharlottea |archive-date=December 22, 2015 }}</ref> The band released ''[[Youth Authority]]'' to positive reviews in 2016, and in 2018 they released their latest album, ''[[Generation Rx]]''.

It was officially released in March 2007, with the precise date varying by country. ''Good Morning Revival'' debuted in the top 10 of thirteen countries worldwide including the U.S., giving the band some of its highest international chart positions thus far, and went on to sell 4.5 million copies. At midnight, on January 23, 2007, the record was made available for pre-order on [[iTunes]]. When pre-ordered, the single \"[[The River (Good Charlotte song)|The River]]\" could be downloaded immediately, while the rest of the album was queued to be downloaded on the release date. Pre-ordering on iTunes also provided the exclusive bonus acoustic version of the song. This album was suggested a different sound for the group apart from the group's pop punk roots.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"[[The River (Good Charlotte song)|The River]]\", featuring [[Avenged Sevenfold]]'s lead singer [[M.

The music video for \"The River\" was added to UK music channels [[Kerrang! TV|Kerrang!]] and [[Scuzz]] on April 13, 2007, making it the second single released from the album in the UK. The song charted at No.&nbsp;108. \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\" was released as the first single in the UK and Australia. \"Keep Your Hands Off My Girl\" charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]] at No.&nbsp;36 the first week of release through download sales and then climbed to No.&nbsp;23 when released in stores. The second single released in North America was \"[[Dance Floor Anthem (I Don't Want to Be in Love)|Dance Floor Anthem]]\", with which the band had scored a surprise hit, making it onto 11 different Billboard charts and peaking at No.&nbsp;2 in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The \"Keep Your Hands Off My Girl\" video was certified gold by [[MTV International]] in December 2007.
