The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple line-up changes, with singer [[Greg Graffin]] being the band's only constant member, though fellow founding members [[Jay Bentley]] and [[Brett Gurewitz]] have also been with the band for most of their history while guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] has been a member of the group since 1994. Guitarist [[Mike Dimkich]] and drummer [[Jamie Miller (US musician)|Jamie Miller]] have been members of the band since 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/178220/9 |title=Bad Religion Announce Shows In Manchester And London |publisher=Stereoboard UK |date=April 4, 2013 |access-date=April 4, 2013}}</ref> having sold over five million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/2047332/a/Tested:+Live.htm |title=Bad Religion Tested: Live CD |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=July 15, 2002 |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz's label [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major label [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] in 1993. Along with [[Punk rock in California|California-based bands]] such as [[Green Day]] and Epitaph-signed acts such as [[The Offspring]], [[NOFX]] and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], the band was responsible for the [[Punk rock#Pop-punk and mainstream success|punk rock revival]] movement of the 1990s.<ref name=\"autobiography\">{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bad-religions-autobiography-do-what-you-want-due-in-august/|title=BAD RELIGION's Autobiography 'Do What You Want' Due In August|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 8, 2020|access-date=March 13, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"theguardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/07/its-the-rawness-why-green-day-and-90s-punk-still-resonates-with-todays-young-music-fans|title='It's the rawness': why Green Day and 90s punk still resonates with today's young music fans|work=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=February 7, 2020|access-date=March 13, 2020}}</ref> Atlantic reissued the previously-released-on-Epitaph album, ''[[Recipe for Hate]]'' (1993), which became commercially successful, as did its 1994 follow-up ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger than Fiction]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bad-religion-mn0000062823/awards|title=Bad Religion - Awards|publisher=[[AllMusic|AllMusic.com]]|access-date=October 10, 2015}}</ref> ''Stranger than Fiction'' included some of Bad Religion's well-known hits, including \"[[Infected (song)|Infected]],\" \"[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger than Fiction]],\" and the re-recorded version of \"[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]]\";<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> the album was later certified gold in both the United States and Canada.\n\nShortly before the release of ''Stranger than Fiction,'' Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis (in response to the breakout success of The Offspring), and was replaced by [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]]. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and, after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001. This resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with \"[[Sorrow (Bad Religion song)|Sorrow]],\" \"[[Los Angeles Is Burning]],\" and \"[[The Devil in Stitches]]\" being Top 40 hits on the [[Alternative Airplay|US charts]] while their sixteenth studio album, ''[[True North (Bad Religion album)|True North]]'' (2013), became Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart where it peaked at number 19.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> The band's seventeenth and most recent studio album, ''[[Age of Unreason (album)|Age of Unreason]],'' was released on May 3, 2019.<ref name=\"blabbermouth\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bad-religion-to-release-age-of-unreason-album-in-may/|title=BAD RELIGION To Release 'Age Of Unreason' Album In May|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 26, 2019|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early recordings (1980\u20131983)===\n[[File:Badreligion1980.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Bad Religion in 1980]]\nBad Religion was formed in [[Los Angeles]], California in 1980<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/media/item.asp?itemID=43|title=Greg Graffin interviewed by Kelly E. and Cathy D \u2013 Media -\u2013The Bad Religion Page \u2013 Since 1995|website=Thebrpage.net|access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/media/item.asp?itemID=60|title=Bad Religion Is Spreading \u2013 Media \u2013 The Bad Religion Page \u2013 Since 1995|website=Thebrpage.net|access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/media/item.asp?itemID=112|title=Addicted to the Opiate of the Masses \u2013 Media \u2013 The Bad Religion Page \u2013 Since 1995|website=Thebrpage.net|access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.badreligion.com/legacy/|title=Bad Religion \u2013 30 Years.|website=Badreligion.com|access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hcnjiZtclQ|title=Bad Religion's Greg Graffin \u2013 Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|last=Loudwire|date=August 16, 2017|access-date=May 27, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> by high school students [[Greg Graffin]], [[Jay Bentley]], [[Jay Ziskrout]], and [[Brett Gurewitz]].

Also in 1981, the band began recording their first full-length album, ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'' During the recording of this album, [[drummer]] Jay Ziskrout quit the band, and was replaced by Pete Finestone. Released in 1982, ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'' was also distributed by the band under the Epitaph label, and sold roughly 12,000 copies.<ref name=\"opiateofthemasses\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/media/item.asp?itemID=112|title=Addicted to the Opiate of the Masses|author=Greene, Jo-Anne.|date=May 23, 1997|work=Goldmine: The Collectors Record and Compact Disc Marketplace}}</ref>\n\n===''Into the Unknown'', ''Back to the Known'' and hiatus (1983\u20131985)===\nIn 1983, the band released ''[[Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)|Into the Unknown]]'', a keyboard-driven [[progressive rock|progressive]] [[hard rock]] album with a slightly slower pace.<ref name=\"intotheunknown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/into-the-unknown-mw0000836297|title=Into The Unknown (review)|author=Dougan, John|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=June 23, 2012}}</ref> Almost all of the albums the band produced were sold out of the warehouse they were housed in without the band's knowledge, after which this album went out of print. This incident, as well as band members' increasingly divergent personal lives, led to the band's temporary dissolution shortly after the album's release.<ref name=\"opiateofthemasses\" />\n\nSoon after, Graffin reassembled Bad Religion with [[Circle Jerks]] guitarist [[Greg Hetson]] replacing Gurewitz, who had gone into rehab for his drug problem. Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower, [[rock and roll]] version of their original sound with the ''[[Back to the Known]]'' EP. Eventually the band split toward the middle of 1985.\n\n===Reunion, ''Suffer'', ''No Control'', ''Against the Grain'' and ''Generator'' (1986\u20131992)===\nBad Religion slowly reformed in 1986 out of the ''Back to the Known'' line-up when Graffin called Bentley and asked him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'', he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back.<ref name=\"opiateofthemasses\" /> This lineup recorded the band's third album, ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]'', which was released in 1988. The album received positive reviews in the independent music press and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as ''[[Trust (magazine)|Trust]]'', ''[[Maximumrocknroll|Maximum Rocknroll]]'' and ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=suffer_%28album%29 |title=Suffer (album) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |access-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Suffer'' tour in 1988, Bad Religion began writing new material. In early 1989, while the band was on break from touring, they commenced work on their next album, and entered the [[Westbeach Recorders]] studio in June of that year to record it. The resulting album, ''[[No Control (Bad Religion album)|No Control]]'', was released in November 1989, and was Bad Religion's best-selling album at the time, eventually selling more than 80,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=no%5Fcontrol%5F%28album%29 |title=No Control (album) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBad Religion's hardcore punk style continued with their next album, ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]'', which was released in 1990. While the album still did not break the band into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=against_the_grain_(album) |title=Against The Grain (album) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref> \"[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]]\", one of the tracks off the album, is generally regarded as the band's most well-known song, and has been played at almost every live show.\n\nDrummer Pete Finestone left Bad Religion again in April 1991 to focus on his other band, the Fishermen, which had signed with a major label, and [[Bobby Schayer]] joined the band as his replacement. In May 1991, Bad Religion entered the Westbeach Recorders studio to begin recording material for their sixth studio album, ''[[Generator (Bad Religion album)|Generator]]'', which was not released until March 1992. The album was recorded almost live in the studio,<ref name=\"Generatorinfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=generator_(album)|title=Generator - the album|website=Thebrpage.net|access-date=September 12, 2009}}</ref> because, at the time, Gurewitz had moved Westbeach to larger premises, and for the first time, the entire band could play in the studio at the same time. He stated that it was \"time to change\" and the band \"did it in a different studio, but as far as the songwriting, it was a deliberate effort to try something different.\"<ref name=\"Generatorinfo\" /> To accompany the album, Bad Religion filmed their first music video \"[[Atomic Garden (song)|Atomic Garden]],\" which was also their first song to be released as a single.\n\nTo coincide with the band's success, Bad Religion released a compilation album, ''[[80\u201385]]'', in 1991. It is a repackaging of their debut album, ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'', their two EPs, ''[[Bad Religion (EP)|Bad Religion]]'' and ''[[Back to the Known]]'' and the band's three track contributions to the ''[[Public Service (EP)|Public Service]]'' EP. This compilation did not include ''[[Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)|Into the Unknown]]''. ''80\u201385'' is now out of print and has been replaced by the 2004 re-issued version of ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'' with the same track listings.\n\n===Mainstream success and departure of Gurewitz (1993\u20131995)===\n\nWith [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1993 and quickly re-released their seventh full-length studio album ''[[Recipe for Hate]]'' on the label that same year. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the album finally broke Bad Religion into mainstream audiences and got their highest U.S. chart position to date, debuting at No.&nbsp;14 on [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart, with \"[[American Jesus]]\" and \"[[Struck a Nerve]]\" in particular becoming major rock radio hits at their time. During their ''Recipe for Hate'' Tour, the band would support several opening acts, including then [[Lookout Records]]-signed punk band [[Green Day]].<ref name=\"pearn\">{{cite news |last1=Pearn |first1=Frank Jr. |title=Punk Band Green Day Taking a 'Bookish' Turn |url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1994-03-18-2957839-story.html |access-date=February 6, 2022 |work=The Morning Call |date=March 18, 1994}}</ref>\n\n''Recipe for Hate'' was followed up by Bad Religion's eighth studio album ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]''. The album met high critical reception upon its release in September 1994, and was their most successful album at the time, scoring such hits as \"[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger Than Fiction]],\" \"[[Infected (song)|Infected]],\" and a re-recording of \"[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]],\" which was originally released on ''Against the Grain''. The band also recorded the song \"Leaders and Followers\" (which later appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese version of ''Stranger Than Fiction'') for the soundtrack for the [[Kevin Smith]] film, ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]''. The album was Bad Religion's first to enter the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; the release peaked at number 87, and was awarded [[RIAA Certification|gold certification]] on March 4, 1998, for sales of over half a million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Certification (type in \"Bad Religion\" in the artist box) |work=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |access-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> With the success of that album, Bad Religion became a key member of the 1990s [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] punk rock explosion, alongside Green Day and fellow Epitaph bands such as [[The Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], and [[NOFX]].<ref name=\"autobiography\" /><ref name=\"theguardian\" />\n\nGurewitz left the band right before the release of ''Stranger Than Fiction''. He officially cited the reason for his departure as the increasing amount of time he was needed at Epitaph as [[The Offspring]] (who had just released ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' to unexpected success and acclaim) became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. Gurewitz, along with many fans, accused the band of [[selling out]] for leaving Epitaph to seek greater financial success.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Neal|title=The Higher Calling|date=May 9, 1996|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=248&iType=25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427023721/http://www.thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=248&iType=25|archive-date=April 27, 2005}}</ref> As tensions increased, Graffin would sing alternate lyrics during concerts, such as, \"I want to know where Brett gets his crack\" or \"I want to know why Gurewitz cracked,\" on the song \"[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger Than Fiction]].\"<ref name=\"strangerthanfiction\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=stranger_than_fiction_%28song%29 |title=Stranger Than Fiction (song) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |website=Thebrpage.net |access-date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> These barbs referred to Gurewitz's struggles with crack, heroin, and other addictions which plagued him for years. Brett discussed his drug use in an interview on the band's ''Suffer Tour'' documentary, ''[[Along the Way]]'', and claimed that he was clean and sober. In response, Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band, [[The Daredevils (band)|The Daredevils]], entitled, \"[[Hate You (Daredevils song)|Hate You]],\" reportedly directed towards Jay Bentley.\n\nGurewitz was replaced as guitarist by [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], a former member of the bands [[Minor Threat]], [[Dag Nasty]], and [[Junkyard (band)|Junkyard]]; Baker declined a spot with [[R.E.M.]] to join Bad Religion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sharpe-Young|first=Garry|title=New Wave of American Heavy Metal|year=2005|publisher=Zonda Books Limited|isbn=0958268401|page=46}}</ref> With Gurewitz gone, Graffin became Bad Religion's primary songwriter (songwriting duties were originally split between the two).\n\n===Post-Gurewitz period, departure of Bobby Schayer (1996\u20132000)===\nBad Religion continued touring and recording without Brett Gurewitz, releasing three more albums for Atlantic, starting with ''[[The Gray Race]]'' (1996), produced by former Cars frontman [[Ric Ocasek]]. Despite never garnering the amount of attention that ''Stranger Than Fiction'' received, it scored Bad Religion a minor U.S. radio hit with the song, \"A Walk,\" as well as the European release of \"Punk Rock Song.\"\n\n[[File:Badr1995.jpg|thumb|[[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] (left) with Bad Religion live in the Netherlands, 1995]]\nIn 1998, Bad Religion released their tenth full-length album, ''[[No Substance]]'', produced by [[Alex Perialas]], Ronnie Kimball, and the band themselves. Although the album was anticipated by music critics and fans alike as a result of the band's previous worldwide successes with ''Stranger Than Fiction'' and ''The Gray Race'', it was given mixed reviews by both critics and fans.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r348580|pure_url=yes}} Ankeny, J: \"No Substance\" review]</ref> Following the release of ''No Substance'', the band embarked on a year-long tour.\n\nIn 1999, Gurewitz reunited with Graffin to co-write a song together called, \"Believe It,\" which would appear on their next album, ''[[The New America]]'' (2000). For this new album, [[Todd Rundgren]], an early musical inspiration for Graffin, was brought in to produce. \"Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself.\" In the summer of 2000, they set out on a successful 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for [[Blink-182]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/shows/tour.asp?tourID=33|title=2000 - The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show Tour (supporting Blink 182) &#124; Tours & shows &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995|website=Thebrpage.net|access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref> Interest in recording the record waned due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, \"I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol, and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything.\"<ref name=\"chartattack\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/features/1515/bad-religion-the-process-of-labels|title=Bad Religion: The Process of Labels|first=Keith|last=Carman|work=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]|date=July 19, 2002|access-date=September 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606183720/http://www.chartattack.com/features/1515/bad-religion-the-process-of-labels|archive-date=June 6, 2011}}</ref> However, Graffin later writes in his book, \"Anarchy Evolution,\" that, although Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin remain friends to this day. Meanwhile, [[Bobby Schayer]] left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by [[Brooks Wackerman]] ([[Suicidal Tendencies]]).\n\n===Return to Epitaph and reunion with Gurewitz (2001\u20132004)===\nIn 2001, Bad Religion departed from Atlantic Records. They returned to Epitaph, and Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band. The expanded six-piece line-up then recorded and released ''[[The Process of Belief]]'' (2002). Graffin stated, \"There was a little bit of disappointment on my part when he left the band, but we never had any serious acrimony between the two of us. I can't say the same for the rest of the band. But he and I, being the songwriters from way back, we really wanted to try again.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/badreligion/articles/story/5927776/the_new_state_of_bad_religion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930221821/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/badreligion/articles/story/5927776/the_new_state_of_bad_religion|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 30, 2007|title=The New State of Bad Religion|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=May 11, 2000}}</ref>\n\nTheir next album, ''[[The Empire Strikes First]]'', was released in June 2004. Like ''The Process of Belief'', it was widely regarded by fans{{who|date=June 2012}} as a return to the faster punk-style songwriting that some felt was less prominent in the band's music during their time on Atlantic.\n\nIn April 2004, the band also re-released digitally-remastered versions of all of their first six studio albums on Epitaph Records (except ''Into the Unknown''). The ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'' reissue, though reclaiming the original title of the band's debut LP, contained all of the same material as the previously issued ''80\u201385'' compilation, including their first EP, the ''[[Public Service (EP)|Public Service]]'' EP (with different versions of the songs Bad Religion, Slaves, and Drastic Actions than the self-titled EP) and the \"Back to the Known\" EP. To coincide with the reissues, they also released their long out-of-print live VHS, ''[[Along the Way]],'' on DVD for the first time. ''Recipe for Hate,'' though, could not be re-issued, even though it was originally released on Epitaph, due to the fact that it had already been re-issued through Atlantic, and so problems with rights ownership made a reissue unlikely.\n\n===''New Maps of Hell'' (2005\u20132008)===\n[[File:Bad Religion 2005-6-22.jpg|left|thumb|Bentley (left) and Graffin (right) with Bad Religion live in the House of Blues, 2005]]\nOn March 7, 2006, a live DVD, ''[[Live at the Palladium (Bad Religion DVD)|Live at the Palladium]],'' was released.

To me it just doesn't say that much; it doesn't say much about you. Instead I bill myself as a naturalist, which I think says a lot more. Because a ''naturalist'' is someone who ... first of all\u2014they study natural science, and they have a hopeful message\u2014I think\u2014to send to the world, which is ... we can agree on what the truth is ... and it has to be through experimentation, verification, and new discoveries, followed by more verification. So ... if we can agree on those terms, we can agree that the truth changes, based on new discoveries, and the ''structure'' of science is such that you can never be so sure of something, because a new discovery can rework the framework\u2014it can ''reconstruct'' the framework of your science and you have to look at the world differently. That makes it a very dynamic and exciting place to be. And if you say you're an atheist, it's not really saying much about how you came to that conclusion. But if you say you're a naturalist, I think it says something. You've reached that point because you've studied science, because you believe there's a ''fundamental'' way of looking at the world that is part of a long tradition.

It's\u2014to me it's just against any established set of rules, and the church just seemed to be the easiest target. It has a ... you know, the Christian religion has this symbol, it has a bunch of beliefs. They say, 'You either believe it or not, this is the way it is,' and that's not the way the world works. So, it was just an easy target to use, to be [[anti-establishment]].\"\n\nGraffin's answer: \"Yeah. When it first came out, we all liked it, you know? We were little kids, and we thought, 'Yeah, this is a great idea. It'll piss people off.' You know, when you're fifteen years old, the first thing you think about is, 'How can I piss people off?' you know? And it's very good to ... it's very easy to piss people off when you're fifteen, especially it's easy to piss off your parents and adults in general. But as you get a little older, or as I've gotten older, I've looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn't so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we've laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol ... the cross is sort of the international symbol [points to a [[no parking]] sign behind him] as this parking symbol, the no parking is ... everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it's not anti-Christian, it's not anti-Buddhist, it's not anti-Jewish, it's not anti-anything. It's simply is [''[[sic]]''] showing ... it's our way of showing that we don't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life, and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought, and it's these things that I feel are bad about religion. It's also very bad about nationalistic views, it's very bad ... It's something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it's only something that mankind will ... it's something mankind will ... I'm sorry, it's something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans.\"\n\nBentley's answer: \"Brett made that when we were fifteen years old. Brett came up with a piece of paper and said, 'Look at this!' and, and we all laughed and said, 'That's really funny,' 'cause the concept of taking that symbol and putting the 'no' thing on top of it was just ... it seemed shocking enough and good enough, because it represented ... sometimes people took it that it represented that we were like Satan worshipers and that we were not liking God, but it was more against, in America, is [''sic''] there's too much TV evangelism, of, you know, 'Send me monies and God will love you', and it's like [scoffs]. So that was, at the time, that was very popular, when we were starting, so that was one of the, one of the things that we still hate the most, is having to pay to be saved in some, like, ridiculous ... you don't need that. You don't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So, that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it's just ... it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe ... it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said, 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know ... you decide.\"\n\nBrian Baker, who joined the band later in their career, summed it up as follows:\n\n\"The name Bad Religion and the crossbuster logo came to pass in the minds of two fifteen-year-olds who were trying to find the most offensive name and image they could possibly find for the punk band they were starting in their garage ...
