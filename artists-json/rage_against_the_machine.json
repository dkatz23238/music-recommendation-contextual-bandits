Formed in 1991, the group consists of vocalist [[Zack de la Rocha]], bassist and backing vocalist [[Tim Commerford]], guitarist [[Tom Morello]], and drummer [[Brad Wilk]]. The band are known for their melding of [[Rap metal|heavy metal and rap music]] with [[punk rock]] and [[funk]] influences, and their [[Political views and activism of Rage Against the Machine|anarchist political views]]. As of 2010, they have sold over 16 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"WordPress\"/> The band was nominated for induction into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] in their first year of eligibility in 2017, then again in 2018, 2019, and 2021, though the bids failed.<ref name=\"RRHOF 2017\"/><ref name=\"RRHOF 2018\" /><ref name=\"RRHOF 2021\" />\n\nRage Against the Machine released its [[Rage Against the Machine (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1992 to commercial and critical success, leading to a slot in the 1993 [[Lollapalooza]] festival; in 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone's]]'' list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=May 31, 2012|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/|access-date=June 5, 2020|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> The band's next two albums, ''[[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]'' (1999), were also successful; both albums topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name=\"Billboard 1996\" /><ref name=\"Billboard 1999\" /> During their initial nine-year run, Rage Against the Machine became a popular and influential band,<ref name=\"Devenish\"/> and had a large influence on the [[nu metal]] genre which came to prominence during the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were also ranked No.&nbsp;33 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''.<ref name=\"ROTN\" />\n\nIn 2000, Rage Against the Machine released the cover album ''[[Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)|Renegades]]'' and disbanded after growing creative differences led to De la Rocha's departure. De la Rocha started a low-profile solo career, while the rest of the band formed the rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Audioslave]] with [[Chris Cornell]], the former frontman of [[Soundgarden]]; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in April 2007. Within the next four years, minus a sabbatical in 2009, the band continued to perform at [[Rage Against the Machine reunion tour|more live venues and festivals]] around the world before going on hiatus once again in 2011. In 2016, Morello, Commerford and Wilk formed a new band, [[Prophets of Rage]], with [[B-Real]], [[Chuck D]], and [[DJ Lord]]; that band released one EP and [[Prophets of Rage (album)|one full-length studio album]] before disbanding in 2019.\n\nAfter an eight-year hiatus, Rage Against the Machine announced in November 2019 that they were reuniting for [[Public Service Announcement Tour|a world tour]], which was initially scheduled to start in 2020, but was ultimately postponed to 2021, and then to 2022, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].\n\n== History ==\n=== 1991\u20131992: Early years ===\n[[File:Rage Against the Machine (Logo).png|alt=Typset logo|thumb|left|Logo from the band's first album.]]\nIn 1991, following the break-up of guitarist Tom Morello's former band [[Lock Up (U.S. band)|Lock Up]], former Lock Up drummer [[Jon Knox]] encouraged Tim Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Morello as he was looking to start a new group.<ref name=\"Myers\"/> Morello soon contacted Brad Wilk, who had unsuccessful auditions for both Lock Up<ref name=\"Myers\"/> and the band that would later become [[Pearl Jam]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/brad-wilk-pearl-jam-audition/|title=Why Brad Wilk Failed Pearl Jam Audition|last=Kielty|first=Martin|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref> This lineup named themselves Rage Against the Machine, after a song de la Rocha had written for his former underground [[hardcore punk]] band [[Inside Out (band)|Inside Out]] (also to be the title of the unrecorded ''Inside Out'' full-length album).<ref name=\"Myers\"/> [[Kent McClard]], with whom Inside Out were associated, had coined the phrase \"rage against the machine\" in a 1989 article in his [[zine]] ''[[No Answers]]''.<ref name=McClard/>\n\nThe blueprint for the group's major-label debut album, demo tape ''[[Rage Against the Machine (demo album)|Rage Against the Machine]]'', was laid on a twelve-song self-released cassette, the cover image of which featured newspaper clippings of the stockmarket section with a single match taped to the inlay card.

During the latter days of his career as the Nightwatchman, Morello joined up with [[Boots Riley]] and formed the [[rap rock]] group [[Street Sweeper Social Club]], which released its [[Street Sweeper Social Club (album)|debut self-titled album]] in June 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, de la Rocha had been working on a solo album collaboration with [[DJ Shadow]], [[Company Flow]], [[Roni Size]] and [[The Roots]]' [[Questlove]],<ref name=\"zackquit\"/> but dropped the project in favor of working with [[Nine Inch Nails]]' [[Trent Reznor]].<ref name=\"reznor\"/> Recording was completed but the album has not been released.<ref name=\"Gargano\"/> A collaboration between de la Rocha and DJ Shadow, the song \"March of Death\" was released for free online in 2003 in protest against the imminent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]],<ref name=\"March of Death\"/> and the 2004 soundtrack ''Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11'' included one of the collaborations with Reznor, \"[[We Want It All]]\".<ref name=\"reznor\"/> In late 2005, de la Rocha was seen singing and playing the [[jarana huasteca]] with [[Son Jarocho]] band [[Son de Madera]] on multiple occasions.<ref name=\"Spin\"/> Rage Against the Machine was ranked 33rd on VH1's ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock'' list in 2005.<ref name=\"ROTN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm|title=VH1: '100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists': 1-50|website=Rock On The Net|access-date=November 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMembers of the band had been offered large sums of money to reunite for concerts and tours, and had turned the offers down.<ref name=\"MTV News\"/> Rumors of tension between de la Rocha and the other former band members subsequently circulated, but Commerford said that he and de la Rocha saw each other often and went [[surfing]] together, while Morello said he and de la Rocha communicated by phone, and had met up at a September 15, 2005 protest in support of the [[South Central Farm]].<ref name=\"Rockline\"/>\n\n=== 2007\u20132008: First reunion and tours ===\n{{Main|Rage Against the Machine reunion tour}}\nRumors that Rage Against the Machine could reunite at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] were circulating in mid-January 2007,<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> and were confirmed on January 22.<ref name=\"Boucher\"/> The band was confirmed to be headlining the final day of Coachella 2007.<ref name=\"Finn\"/> The reunion was described by Morello as primarily being a vehicle to voice the band's opposition to the \"[[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[purgatory]]\" the United States had \"slid into\" under the [[George W. Bush administration]] since Rage Against the Machine's dissolution.<ref name=\"NME\"/> Though the performance was initially thought to be a one-off,<ref name=\"Cohen 2007\"/> this turned out not to be the case.\n\nOn April 14, 2007, Morello and de la Rocha reunited onstage early to perform a brief acoustic set at a [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]] rally in downtown Chicago. Morello described the event as \"very exciting for everybody in the room, myself included\".<ref name=\"Launch Radio Networks\"/> This was followed by the scheduled Coachella performance on Sunday, April 29 where the band staged a much anticipated performance in front of an [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|EZLN]] backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival.<ref name=\"reunionnme\"/><ref name=\"reunionyahoo\"/><ref name=\"reunionmtv\"/>\n\n[[File:Rage Against The Machine at Vegoose 2007 11.jpg|thumb|Rage Against the Machine performing in 2007]]\nRage Against the Machine continued to tour in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan,<ref name=\"Cecbuzz\"/> and also played a series of shows in Europe in Summer 2008 including [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]], [[Pinkpop Festival]], [[T in the Park]] in Scotland, the [[Hultsfred Festival]] in Sweden, the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in England and the [[Oxegen]] Festival in Ireland. The band also performed on August 2, 2008, in Chicago as one of the headliners ([[Radiohead]], [[Kanye West]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] being the other three) for the 2008 [[Lollapalooza]] Music Festival. When asked in May 2007 if the band was planning on writing a new album, Morello replied:\n\n{{Blockquote|There are no plans to do that ... That's a whole other ball of wax right there. Writing and recording albums is a whole different thing than getting back on the bike (laughs), you know, and playing these songs. But I think that the one thing about the Rage catalog is that to me none of it feels dated. You know, it doesn't feel at all like a nostalgia show. It feels like these are songs that were born and bred to be played now.<ref name=\"futurealbum-bm\"/>}}\n\nMorello declined to comment about the possibility of a new album when interviewed by [[MTV News]] in April 2008.<ref name=\"Harris\"/> In July 2008, it was revealed that de la Rocha had begun a new project called [[One Day as a Lion]] with drummer [[Jon Theodore]] formerly of [[The Mars Volta]], with an eponymous EP released on July 22, 2008.<ref name=\"Tao\"/>\n\nIn August 2008, de la Rocha revealed his take on the possibility of new material:\n\n{{Blockquote|We're going to keep playing shows&nbsp;\u2013 we have a couple of big ones happening in front of both conventions.

The band was supported by [[Flobots]], [[State Radio]], [[Jello Biafra]], and [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]].<ref name=\"Jefferson\"/> Following the concert, the band, following uniformed veterans from Iraq Veterans Against the War, led the 8,000 attendees to the Denver Coliseum on a six-mile march to Invesco Field, host of the DNC. After a four-hour stand-off with police, Obama's campaign agreed to meet with members of Iraq Veterans Against the War and hear their demands.<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times\"/>\n\nIn September 2008, Rage performed at the [[Target Center]] in [[Minneapolis]] during the [[Republican National Convention]]. The previous day, they attempted to play a surprise set at a free anti-RNC concert at the Minnesota Capitol in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], but were prevented from doing so by the police. Instead, de la Rocha and Morello rapped and sang through a megaphone. Later that evening, Morello and Boots Reilly joined up with Billy Bragg and Jim Walsh for a three-hour jam session at Pepitos Parkway theater in south Minneapolis.\n\nIn December 2008, Tom Morello revealed that Rage Against the Machine shows in 2009 were a possibility, although plans for the band to record a new studio album were very unlikely. When asked by [[Billboard.com]] whether they planned to head to the studio in 2009, Morello stated: \"we've had a wonderful year and a half of playing shows, and I don't see any reason to not play more shows. The thing is there's only so many hours in the musical day, and mine are very occupied right now\".<ref name=\"Graff\"/>\n\nMorello elaborated that [[the Nightwatchman]] is now \"my principal musical focus, as I see it, for the remainder of my life. From the earliest days of playing open mic nights at coffee houses, it was apparent to me that this music was as important to me as any music I've ever been involved in. It really encapsulates everything I want to do as an artist.\"<ref name=\"Graff\"/> He repeated this point in an interview with the ''Los Angeles Times''.<ref name=\"Martens\"/>\n\nHowever, after the \"Rage Factor\" celebratory show in Finsbury Park on June 6, 2010, after the campaign to get \"Killing in the Name\" to the No. 1 spot at Christmas, Zack de la Rocha stated that it was a \"genuine possibility\". Stating that they may use the momentum from the campaign to get back into the studio and write a follow-up record to 2000's ''Renegades'' after 10 years. When talking to NME, Zack de la Rocha said: \"I think it's a genuine possibility, We have to get our heads around what we're going to do towards the end of the year and finish up on some other projects and we'll take it from there.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Slater |first=Luke |url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/4140196-new-rage-against-the-machine-record-a-possibility |title=New Rage Against The Machine record \"a possibility\" / Music News // Drowned In Sound |newspaper=Drownedinsound |date=June 7, 2010 |access-date=August 26, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109081949/http://drownedinsound.com/news/4140196-new-rage-against-the-machine-record-a-possibility |archive-date=November 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132015: UK \"Killing in the Name\" Christmas campaign, European tour, and L.A. Rising ===\nIn December 2009, a campaign was launched on Facebook by [[Jon Morter]] and his wife Tracy, in order to stop, most notably, ''The X Factor'' hits from becoming almost automatic Christmas number ones on the UK Singles Chart. It generated nationwide publicity and took the track \"[[Killing in the Name]]\" to the coveted [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one]] slot in the [[UK Singles Chart]], which had been dominated for four consecutive years from 2005 by winners from the popular TV show ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]''.<ref name=\"New Music Express\"/> Before the chart was announced on December 20, 2009, the Facebook group membership stood at over 950,000, and was acknowledged (and supported) by [[Tom Morello]],<ref name=\"Twitter\"/> [[Dave Grohl]],<ref name=\"Gigwise\"/> [[Paul McCartney]],<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 2009\"/> [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Fightstar]],<ref name=\"Official Fightstar Facebook\"/> ''[[NME]]'', [[John Lydon]],<ref name=\"NME\"/> [[Bill Bailey]],<ref name=\"NME\"/> [[Lenny Henry]],<ref name=\"NME\"/> [[BBC Radio 1]],<ref name=\"YouTube\"/> [[Hadouken!

The campaign was ultimately successful, and \"Killing in the Name\" became the number-one single in the UK for Christmas 2009.<ref name=\"The Official Charts\"/><ref name=\"BBC news\"/> [[Zack de la Rocha]] spoke to BBC One upon hearing the news, stating that:\n[[File:Rage Against The Machine 11.jpg|alt=The band onstage|thumb|Performing in 2010]]\n{{Blockquote|We're very very ecstatic and excited about the song reaching the number one spot.

This proved to be popular, with many users facing connection issues. The tickets were all allocated by 13:30 that same day.<ref name=\"NME 2010\"/> After allowing ticket holders to vote for who they wanted to be the support acts for \"The Rage Factor\", it was announced that [[Gogol Bordello]], [[Gallows (band)|Gallows]] and [[Roots Manuva]] would support Rage Against the Machine at the concert.<ref name=\"Gigwise 2010\"/>\n\nIn addition to the free gig at Finsbury Park, the band headlined European festivals in June 2010 including the [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington Park]], England, [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]] in Germany and [[Rock in Rio]] Madrid in Spain.<ref name=\"Download Festival 2010\"/> They also performed in Ireland on June 8 and the Netherlands on June 9. Zack de la Rocha had stated that it was a definite possibility that the band would record a new album, the first time since 2000's ''Renegades''.<ref name=\"O'Neal\"/> Morter confirmed this, stating the discussions he and the band had backstage before the Finsbury Park gig saying the band did write new material, but they had no motivation to release them until now. de la Rocha mentioned the very strong reaction from the [[Download Festival]] 2010 audience as an incentive for releasing new material.<ref name=\"Rock Radio\"/> In addition, the band returned to Los Angeles on July 23, 2010, for their first U.S. show in two years and their first hometown show in 10 years.<ref name=\"Soundstrike\"/> The concert benefited Arizona organizations that are fighting the [[SB1070]] immigration law. On the night of the show, a spokesperson announced to the crowd that ticket sales\u2014all of which are non-profit to the bands\u2014had raised $300,000. The band has been confirmed to do a short South American tour in October, performing at venues such as the SWU Festival in Brazil, the Maquinaria Festival in Chile, and Pepsi Music Festival in Argentina. It was the first time the band played in those countries.\n\nDuring an interview with the Chilean newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, \"We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere\".<ref name=\"La Tercera\"/> However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band was not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. \"The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio\", Morello told ''The Pulse of Radio''. \"We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)\".<ref name=\"Blabbermouth\"/> The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with [[El Gran Silencio]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Rise Against]] and [[Muse (band)|Muse]].<ref name=\"Blabbermouth\"/> During an interview on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans for the next two years were in place.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vadala |first=Nick |url=http://www.mxdwn.com/2011/08/02/news/rage-against-the-machine-bassist-tim-commerford-says-new-material-in-the-works-next-two-years-planned-out/ |title=Rage Against The Machine Bassist Tim Commerford Says New Material in the Works, Next Two Years Planned Out &#124; mxdwn.com News |publisher=Mxdwn.com |date=August 2, 2011 |access-date=December 24, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915134338/http://www.mxdwn.com/2011/08/02/news/rage-against-the-machine-bassist-tim-commerford-says-new-material-in-the-works-next-two-years-planned-out/ |archive-date=September 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn an October 2012 interview with [[TMZ (website)|TMZ]], bassist [[Tim Commerford]] was asked if Rage Against the Machine was working on a new album.

flag of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]]]]\nThe members of Rage Against the Machine are well known for their leftist [[anti-authoritarian]] and [[revolutionary]] political views, and almost all of the band's songs focus on these views. Key to the band's identity, Rage Against the Machine has voiced viewpoints highly critical of the domestic and foreign policies of current and previous U.S. governments. Throughout its existence, Rage Against the Machine and its individual members participated in political protests and other activism to advocate these beliefs. The band sees its music as a vehicle for social activism; De la Rocha explained, \"I'm interested in spreading those ideas through art, because music has the power to cross borders, to break military sieges and to establish real dialogue.\"<ref name=\"Juice\">Wooldridge, Simon (February 2000), \"[http://musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/juice00.htm Fight the Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201001329/http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/juice00.htm |date=February 1, 2011 }}\", ''[[Juice Magazine]]''.
