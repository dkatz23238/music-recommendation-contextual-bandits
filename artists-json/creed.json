It was based on Christian understanding of the [[Gospel|canonical gospels]], the [[epistle|letters]] of the [[New Testament]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Old Testament]]. Affirmation of this creed, which describes the [[Trinity]], is generally taken as a fundamental test of [[orthodoxy]] for most [[Christian denomination|Christian denominations]], and was historically purposed against [[Arianism]].<ref>[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Johnson, Phillip R. \"The Nicene Creed.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314061400/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm |date=2009-03-14 }} Accessed 17 May 2009</ref> A shorter version of the creed, called the [[Apostles' Creed]], is nowadays the most used version in Christian services. \n\nSome Christian denominations [[#Christians without creeds|do not use any of those creeds]].\n\nAlthough some say [[Judaism]] is non-creedal in nature, others say it recognizes a single creed, the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'', which begins: \"Hear, O Israel: the {{Lord}} our God, the {{Lord}} is one.\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Deut|6:4|HE}}</ref>\n\nIn Islamic theology, the term most closely corresponding to \"creed\" is ''[[\u02bfAq\u012bdah|\u02bfaq\u012bdah]]'' ({{lang|ar|\u0639\u0642\u064a\u062f\u0629}}).{{cn|date=July 2022}}\n\n==Terminology==\n{{See also|Credo}}\nThe word ''creed'' is particularly used for a concise statement which is recited as part of [[liturgy]]. The term is anglicized from Latin ''credo'' \"I believe\", the [[incipit]] of the Latin texts of the [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Nicene Creed]]. A creed is sometimes referred to as a ''symbol'' in a specialized meaning of that word (which was first introduced to [[Late Middle English]] in this sense), after Latin ''symbolum'' \"creed\" (as in ''[[Apostles' Creed|Symbolum Apostolorum]]'' = the \"[[Apostles' Creed]]\", a shorter version of the traditional Nicene Creed), after Greek ''symbolon'' \"token, watchword\".<ref>Justo L. Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', 2nd ed., Vol. 1, p. 77.</ref>\n\nSome longer statements of faith in the [[Protestant]] tradition are instead called \"confessions of faith\", or simply \"confession\" (as in e.g. [[Helvetic Confession]]). Within [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestantism]], the terms \"doctrinal statement\" or \"doctrinal basis\" tend to be preferred. Doctrinal statements may include positions on [[lectionary]] and [[translations of the Bible]], particularly in [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] churches of the [[King James Only movement]].\n\nThe term ''creed'' is sometimes extended to comparable concepts in non-Christian theologies; thus the Islamic concept of ''[[\u02bfAq\u012bdah|\u02bfaq\u012bdah]]'' (literally \"bond, tie\") is often rendered as \"creed\".\n\n==Jewish creed==\n{{See also|Jewish principles of faith}}\nWhether [[Judaism]] is creedal in character or not has generated controversies.

Various [[Christian denominations]] from [[Protestantism]] and [[Evangelicalism | Evangelical Christianity]] have published confession of faith as a basis for fellowship among churches of the same denomination. <ref> J. Gordon Melton, ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism'', Infobase Publishing, USA, 2005, p. 170</ref><ref> Walter A. Elwell, ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 286-289</ref>\n\nMany [[Christian denominations]] did not try to be too exhaustive in their confessions of faith and thus allow different opinions on some secondary topics.<ref> Walter A. Elwell, ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 289</ref>In addition, some churches are open to revising their confession of faith when necessary. Moreover, [[Baptist]] \"confessions of faith\" have often had a clause such as this from the [[First London Baptist Confession]] (Revised edition, 1646):<ref> Barrington Raymond White, ''Pilgrim Pathways: Essays in Baptist History'', Mercer University Press, USA, 1999, p. 275 </ref>\n\n{{quote|Also we confess that we now know but in part and that are ignorant of many things which we desire to and seek to know: and if any shall do us that friendly part to show us from the Word of God that we see not, we shall have cause to be thankful to God and to them.}}\n\n=== Excommunication ===\n[[Excommunication]] is a practice of the [[Bible]] to exclude members who do not respect the Church's confession of faith and do not want to repent. <ref> Ronald F. Youngblood, ''Nelson's Illustrated Bible Dictionary: New and Enhanced Edition'', Thomas Nelson Inc, USA, 2014, p. 378</ref> It is practiced by all [[Christian denominations]] and is intended to protect against the consequences of [[heresy |heretics']] teachings and [[apostasy]]. <ref> Chad Brand, Eric Mitchell, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', B&H Publishing Group, USA, 2015, p. 521-522</ref>\n\n===Christians without creeds===\nSome Christian denominations do not profess a creed. This stance is often referred to as \"non-creedalism\". The [[Religious Society of Friends]], also known as the Quakers, consider that they have no need for creedal formulations of faith. \n\n[[Anabaptism|Anabaptists]] like the [[Mennonites]], the [[Amish]] and the [[Hutterites]] do not profess a creed but have some \"confessions\" that state doctrines, usages, and regulations that are essential for Anabaptist christianity like [[believer's baptism]] or [[Matthew 5:34|not to swear oaths]]. The two most important of these confessions are the [[Schleitheim Confession]] of 1527 and the [[Dordrecht Confession of Faith|Dordrecht Confession]] of 1632.<ref>[https://gameo.org/index.php?title=Confessions,_Doctrinal Doctrinal Confessions] at [[GAMEO]].</ref><ref>[https://gameo.org/index.php?title=Schleitheim_Confession Schleitheim Confession] at [[GAMEO]].</ref><ref>[https://gameo.org/index.php?title=Dordrecht_Confession_of_Faith_(Mennonite,_1632) Dordrecht Confession] at [[GAMEO]].</ref> Likewise the [[Church of the Brethren]] and other [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] churches who are often seen as Anabapists also espouse no creed, referring to the New Testament, as their \"rule of faith and practice.\"<ref>Martin, Harold S.: [http://www.brfwitness.org/?p=88 \"Forward\"], \"Basic Beliefs Within the Church of the Brethren\".</ref> \n\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] contrast \"memorizing or repeating creeds\" with acting to \"do what Jesus said\".<ref>\"Creeds\u2014Any Place in True Worship?\", ''Awake!'', October 8, 1985, \u00a9Watch Tower, page 23, \"The opening words of a creed invariably are, \u201cI believe\u201d or, \u201cWe believe.\u201d This expression is translated from the Latin word \u201ccredo,\u201d from which comes the word \u201ccreed.\u201d ...What do we learn from Jesus\u2019 words?

It was based on the 2nd century Rules of Faith and the interrogatory declaration of faith for those receiving [[baptism]], which by the 4th century was everywhere tripartite in structure, following Matthew 28:19.\n* The [[Apostles' Creed]] is used in [[Western Christianity]] for both [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechetical]] purposes.\n* The [[Nicene Creed]] reflects the concerns of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 which had as their chief purpose to establish what Christians believed.<ref>[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Kiefer, James E. \"The Nicene Creed.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314061400/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm |date=2009-03-14 }} Accessed 17 May 2009</ref>\n* The [[Chalcedonian Creed]] was adopted at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 in Asia Minor. It defines that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', which 'come together into one person and hypostasis'.\n* The [[Athanasian Creed]] (''Quicunque vult'') is a Christian statement of belief focusing on Trinitarian doctrine and Christology. It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated and differs from the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds in the inclusion of anathemas, or condemnations of those who disagree with the Creed.\n* The [[Tridentine Creed]] was initially contained in the [[papal bull]] ''[[Iniunctum Nobis]]'', issued by [[Pope Pius IV]] on November 13, 1565.  The creed was intended to summarize the teaching of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563).\n* The [[Maasai Creed]] is a creed composed in  1960 by the [[Maasai people]] of East Africa in collaboration with  missionaries  from the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Congregation of the Holy Ghost]]. The creed attempts to express the essentials of the Christian faith within the Maasai culture.\n* The [[Credo of the People of God]] is a confession of faith that [[Pope Paul VI]] published with the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Solemni hac liturgia'' of 30 June 1968. Pope Paul VI spoke of it as \"a creed which, without being strictly speaking a dogmatic definition, repeats in substance, with some developments called for by the spiritual condition of our time, the [[Nicene Creed|creed of Nicea]], the creed of the immortal tradition of the holy Church of God.\"\n\n===Christian confessions of faith===\nProtestant denominations are usually associated with confessions of faith, which are similar to creeds but usually longer.\n* The ''Sixty-seven Articles'' of the Swiss reformers, drawn up by [[Zwingli]] in 1523;\n* The ''[[Schleitheim Confession]]'' of the [[Anabaptist]] [[Swiss Brethren]]  in 1527; \n* The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' of 1530, the work of [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]], which marked the breach with [[Rome]];\n* The ''[[Tetrapolitan Confession]]'' of the [[German Reformed Church]], 1530;\n* The ''[[Smalcald Articles]]'' of Martin Luther, 1537\n* The ''[[Guanabara Confession of Faith]]'', 1558;\n* The ''[[Gallic Confession]]'', 1559;\n* The ''[[Scots Confession]]'', drawn up by [[John Knox]] in 1560;\n* The ''[[Belgic Confession]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Belgic Confession|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/BelgicConfession.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109220655/https://reformed.org/documents/BelgicConfession.html|archive-date=November 9, 2020|access-date=2013-01-23|publisher=Reformed.org}}</ref> drawn up by [[Guido de Bres]]<ref>{{cite web|date=2000-04-20|title=Guido de Bres|url=http://www.prca.org/books/portraits/debres.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006130349/http://www.prca.org/books/portraits/debres.htm|archive-date=October 6, 2020|access-date=2013-01-23|publisher=Prca.org}}</ref> in 1561;\n* The ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]]'' of the [[Church of England]] in 1562;\n* The ''[[Formula of Concord]]'' and its Epitome in 1577;\n* The ''[[Irish Articles]]'' in 1615;<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ford|first=Alan|date=2007|title=James Ussher: Theology, History, and Politics in Early-Modern Ireland and England|url=https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199274444.001.0001/acprof-9780199274444-chapter-5|access-date=November 19, 2020|website=Oxford University|isbn=9780199274444}}</ref>\n* The ''[[Remonstrant Confession]]'' in 1621;\n* The [[1644 Baptist Confession of Faith|Baptist Confession of Faith]] in 1644 (upheld by Reformed Baptists)\n* The ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' in 1647 was the work of the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]] and has commended itself to the [[Presbyterian Church]]es of all English-speaking peoples, and also in other languages.\n* The ''[[Savoy Declaration]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Savoy Declaration 1658 \u2013 Contents|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/Savoy_Declaration/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526210127/http://www.reformed.org/documents/Savoy_Declaration/|archive-date=May 26, 2020|access-date=2013-01-23|publisher=Reformed.org}}</ref> of 1658 which was a modification of the Westminster Confession to suit [[Congregationalist polity]];\n*The ''Standard Confession'' in 1660 (upheld by [[General Baptists]]);<ref name=\"ChuteFinnHaykin2015\">{{cite book |last1=Chute |first1=Anthony L. |last2=Finn |first2=Nathan A. |last3=Haykin |first3=Michael A.
