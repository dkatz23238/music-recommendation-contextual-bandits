A multi-instrumentalist, he mainly plays guitar and keyboards and is noted for his [[falsetto]]. He has been described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as one of the most influential singers of his generation.\n\nYorke formed Radiohead with schoolmates at [[Abingdon School]] in [[Oxfordshire]], and studied at the [[University of Exeter]]. In 1991, Radiohead signed to [[Parlophone]]; their 1992 debut single, \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", made Yorke a celebrity, and Radiohead went on to achieve critical acclaim and sales of over 30 million albums. Yorke's early influences included [[alternative rock]] acts such as the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[R.E.M.|R.E.M]]; with Radiohead's fourth album, ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000), Yorke moved into [[electronic music]], influenced by [[Warp (record label)|Warp]] acts such as [[Aphex Twin]]. With the artist [[Stanley Donwood]], Yorke creates artwork for Radiohead albums and his other projects. He often incorporates \"erratic\" dancing into his performances.\n\nYorke's solo work comprises mainly electronic music. His debut solo album, ''[[The Eraser]]'', was released in 2006. To perform it live, in 2009 he formed a new band, [[Atoms for Peace (band)|Atoms for Peace]], with musicians including the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] and the Radiohead producer [[Nigel Godrich]]; they released an album, ''[[Amok (Atoms for Peace album)|Amok]]'', in 2013. Yorke's second solo album, ''[[Tomorrow's Modern Boxes]],'' was released in 2014, followed by ''[[Anima (Thom Yorke album)|Anima]]'' in 2019. In 2021, Yorke debuted a new band, the [[The Smile (band)|Smile]], with the Radiohead guitarist [[Jonny Greenwood]] and the jazz drummer [[Tom Skinner (drummer)|Tom Skinner]]; they released an album, ''[[A Light for Attracting Attention]]'', in 2022. Yorke has collaborated with artists including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Flying Lotus]] and [[Modeselektor]], and has composed for film and theatre; his first feature film soundtrack, ''[[Suspiria (2018 soundtrack)|Suspiria]],'' was released in October 2018.\n\nYorke is an activist on behalf of [[human rights]], [[animal rights]], [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[anti-war]] causes, and his lyrics incorporate political themes. He has been critical of the music industry, particularly of [[Record label|major labels]] and [[Streaming media|streaming]] services such as [[Spotify]]. With Radiohead and his solo work, he has pioneered alternative release platforms such as [[Pay what you want|pay-what-you-want]] and [[BitTorrent]]. Along with the other members of Radiohead, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2019.\n\n==Early life==\nYorke was born on 7 October 1968 in [[Wellingborough|Wellingborough, Northamptonshire]]. He was born with a paralysed left eye, and underwent five eye operations by the age of six.<ref>Randall, p. 19</ref> According to Yorke, the last surgery was \"botched\", giving him a [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]].<ref name=\"MCLEAN\">{{cite news |first=Craig |last=McLean |title=All messed up |date=18 June 2006 |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795948,00.html |work=The Observer |access-date=26 March 2007 |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723180139/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795948,00.html |archive-date=23 July 2008  }}</ref> He decided against further surgery: \"I decided I liked the fact that it wasn't the same, and I've liked it ever since.
