Subsequently based in [[Macon, Georgia]], they incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[country music]], and their live shows featured [[jam band]]-style [[improvisation]] and [[instrumental]]s.\n\nTheir first two studio releases, ''[[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|The Allman Brothers Band]]'' (1969) and ''[[Idlewild South]]'' (1970) (both released by Capricorn Records), stalled commercially, but their 1971 live release ''[[At Fillmore East]]'' was an artistic and commercial breakthrough. It features extended versions of their songs \"[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]\" and \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", and is considered among the best [[live album]]s ever made.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nGroup leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year \u2013 on October 29, 1971 \u2013 and the band dedicated ''[[Eat a Peach]]'' (1972) to his memory, a dual studio/live album that cemented the band's popularity and featured Gregg Allman's \"[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]\" and [[Dickey Betts]]'s \"[[Blue Sky (song)|Blue Sky]]\". Following the motorcycling death of bassist Berry Oakley one year and 13 days later on November 11, 1972, the group recruited keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]] and bassist [[Lamar Williams]] for 1973's ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]].'' The album included Betts's [[hit single]] \"[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]\" and instrumental \"[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]\", which went on to become [[classic rock]] radio staples and placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music. Internal turmoil overtook them soon after; the group dissolved in 1976, reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes, and dissolved again in 1982.\n\nThe band re-formed once more in 1989, releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist [[Oteil Burbridge]] and guitarists [[Warren Haynes]] and [[Derek Trucks]] (the nephew of their original drummer) and became renowned for their month-long string of shows at New York City's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] each spring. The band retired for good in October 2014 after their final show at the Beacon Theatre.\n\nButch Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on January 24, 2017 in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] at the age of 69. Gregg Allman died from complications arising from liver cancer on May 27, 2017 at his home in Georgia, also at 69.

Gregg was first to pick up the guitar, but his brother soon surpassed him, dropping out of high school to practice constantly.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=10}} The duo formed their first band, the Escorts, which evolved into the [[Allman Joys]] in the mid-1960s.<ref name=\"AM\"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=18}} By 1967, the group spent time in [[St. Louis]], where a [[Los Angeles]]-based recording executive discovered them; they consequently moved out West and were renamed the [[Hour Glass (band)|Hour Glass]], cutting two unsuccessful albums for [[Liberty Records]].<ref name=\"AM\"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=46}} Duane moved back to pursue a career as a session musician in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], while Gregg stayed behind in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] bound by contractual obligations with Liberty, who believed he could hold a solo career.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=90}} The two were apart for the first time for a year, but managed to reconvene in [[Miami]], producing an album-length demo with [[the 31st of February]], a group that included drummer Butch Trucks.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=99}}\n\nAt [[FAME Studios]] in Muscle Shoals, Duane Allman became the primary session guitarist, recording with artists such as [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[King Curtis]].<ref name=\"AM\"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=6}} Duane suggested to [[Wilson Pickett]] they record a cover of \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[the Beatles]]; the single went to number 23 on the national charts.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=88}} FAME signed Duane to a five-year recording contract, and he put together a group, including Johnny Sandlin and Paul Hornsby. Duane recruited [[Jaimoe|Jai Johanny Johanson]] (Jaimoe) after hearing his drumming on a songwriting demo of Jackie Avery, and the two moved into his home on the [[Tennessee River]]. Allman invited bassist [[Berry Oakley]] to jam with the new group; the pair had met in a [[Macon, Georgia]] club some time earlier, and became quick friends.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} The group had immediate chemistry, and Duane's vision for a \"different\" band\u2014one with two lead guitarists and two drummers\u2014began evolving.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} Meanwhile, [[Phil Walden]], the manager of the late [[Otis Redding]] and several other R&B acts, was looking to expand into rock acts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=9}} FAME owner [[Rick Hall]] became frustrated with the group's recording methods, and offered the tracks recorded and their contract to Walden and [[Jerry Wexler]] of [[Atlantic Records]], who purchased them for $10,000.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=110}} Walden intended the upcoming group to be the centerpiece of his new Atlantic-distributed label, [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=13}}\n\nDuane and Jaimoe moved to Jacksonville in early March 1969, as Duane had become frustrated with being a \"robot\" of those at FAME.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=27}} He invited anyone who wanted to join to the [[jam sessions]] that birthed the Allman Brothers Band. [[Dickey Betts]], leader of Oakley's previous band, the Second Coming, became the group's second lead guitarist, while Butch Trucks, with whom Duane and Gregg had cut a demo less than a year prior, became the new group's second drummer.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The Second Coming's [[Reese Wynans]] played keyboards, and Duane, Oakley, and Betts all shared vocal duties.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The unnamed group began to perform free shows in Willow Branch Park in Jacksonville, with an ever-changing, rotating cast of musicians.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=24}} Duane felt strongly his brother should be the vocalist of the new group (which effectively eliminated Wynans's position, as Gregg also played keyboards).{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=25}} Gregg left Los Angeles and entered rehearsal on March 26, 1969, when the group was rehearsing [[Muddy Waters]]' \"[[Trouble No More (song)|Trouble No More]]\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=28}} Although Gregg was initially intimidated by the musicians, Duane pressured his brother into \"singing [his] guts out.\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Four days later, the group made their debut at the Jacksonville Armory.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Although many names were kicked around, including [[Beelzebub]], the six-piece eventually decided on the Allman Brothers Band.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=109}}\n\n===Debut and early years (1969\u20131970)===\n{{See also|The Allman Brothers Band (album)}}\n\nThe group moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] by May 1, where Walden was establishing Capricorn Records.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=32}} Mike Callahan and [[Joseph L. Campbell|Joseph \"Red Dog\" Campbell]] became the band's early crew members. \"Red Dog\" was a disabled [[Vietnam War|Vietnam veteran]] who donated his monthly disability checks to the band's cause.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=118}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=30}} In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which became known as the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=33}}  \"There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning, but they all just moved out,\" said Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=39}}  Living meagerly, they found a friend in \"Mama Louise\" Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H&H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=36}} early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side. The band's image was radical in the just [[Racial integration|barely integrated]] Macon: \"A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long-haired boys, or of them always having a black guy with them,\" said Hudson.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=34}} The band performed locally, as well as 80 miles north in [[Atlanta]]'s [[Piedmont Park]], and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=36}}\n\nThe group forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming [[psychedelic drugs]], and hanging out in [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Macon, Georgia)|Rose Hill Cemetery]], where they wrote songs.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=46}} Their first performances outside the [[Southern United States|South]] came on May 30 and 31 in [[Boston]], opening for [[The Velvet Underground]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=46}} In need of more material, the group remade old blues numbers such as \"Trouble No More\" and \"[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]\", in addition to improvised jams such as \"[[Mountain Jam]]\".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=41}} Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band's sole songwriter, composing songs such as \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\" and \"Black-Hearted Woman\".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=42}}  The band was originally set to record their first album in Miami with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[John Coltrane]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who proved unavailable.{{sfn|Allman|2014|p=200}} Instead, they headed off for New York City in August 1969 to work with Atlantic house engineer [[Adrian Barber]] in his first producer credit.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=51}} ''[[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|The Allman Brothers Band]]'' was recorded and mixed in two weeks,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=51}} and proved a positive experience for the ensemble.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=52}} New York came to be regarded within the group as their \"second home\".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=51}} ''The Allman Brothers Band'' was released in November 1969 through [[Atco Records|Atco]] and [[Capricorn Records]],{{sfn|Freeman|1996|p=59}} but received a poor commercial response, selling less than 35,000 copies upon initial release.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=64}}\n\nExecutives suggested to Walden that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to \"acclimate\" them to the industry. \"They wanted us to act 'like a rock band' and we just told them to fuck themselves,\" remembered Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=65}} For their part, the members of the band remained optimistic, electing to stay in the South. \"Everyone told us we'd fall by the wayside down there,\" said Gregg Allman,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=65}} but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records \"transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip, wild and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers\".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=66}} The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of New York City's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was \"where the brotherhood came to pass,\" according to roadie Kim Payne; \"There was a pact made out there around a campfire\u2014all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [in the band] 100 percent.\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Much of the material presented on the band's second album, ''[[Idlewild South]]'', originated at the cabin.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Oakley's wife rented a large [[Tudor Revival architecture#21st-century Tudor Revival|Tudor Revival]] home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved into what they dubbed \"[[The Allman Brothers Band Museum|the Big House]]\" in March 1970.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=71}}\n\n===Live reputation, ''At Fillmore East'', and breakthrough (1970\u20131971)===\n{{See also|Idlewild South|At Fillmore East}}\n\n[[Image:Duane Allman.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Duane Allman]], the group's leader, was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1971.]]\nThe band played continuously in 1970, performing over 300 dates on the road traveling in a Ford Econoline van and later, a Winnebago, nicknamed the Wind Bag.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=144}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=99}} Walden doubted the band's future, worrying whether they would ever catch on, but word of mouth spread due to the band's relentless touring schedule, and crowds got larger.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}} The close proximity of the Winnebago brought about heavy drug use within the group, and all in the group, with the exception of the brothers, were struggling to make a living.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=101}} In one instance, touring manager Twiggs Lyndon stabbed and killed a promoter for not paying the band; he later cited temporary insanity.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=103}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=139}} Later that year, Duane accidentally overdosed on opium after a show.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=108}} \"Idlewild South\", produced by Tom Dowd, was recorded gradually over a period of five months in various cities, including New York, Miami, and Macon, and contained two of the band's best-known songs, \"[[Midnight Rider]]\" (later a hit for various artists, including a Top 20 solo effort by Gregg) and \"[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]\", which became one of the band's famous concert numbers.<ref name=\"AM\"/>\n\n''Idlewild South'' was issued by Atco and Capricorn Records in September 1970, less than a year after their debut.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} The album sold only \"marginally better than its predecessor, though the band had a growing national reputation and the album included songs that would become staples of the band's repertoire\u2014and eventually of rock radio.\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}} Shortly after completing recording, Dowd put Duane in contact with guitarist [[Eric Clapton]], who invited him to contribute to his new project, [[Derek and the Dominos]]. Allman was a huge fan of Clapton's work with Cream, and Clapton had been blown away by Allman's session work on [[Wilson Pickett]]'s \"[[Hey Jude]]\" some years prior.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=82}} They met after a show one night in Miami and jammed together until the next afternoon,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=83}} with the two guitarists regarding one another as \"instant soulmates\".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=84}} Clapton invited Duane to join Derek and the Dominos, and by several accounts he considered it; in the end, he declined the offer and rejoined the Allman Brothers Band, returning after missing a string of several shows.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=88}} The sessions were collected on ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'', issued that November.\n\nTheir fortunes began to change over the course of 1971, when the band's average earnings doubled.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=115}} \"We realized that the audience was a big part of what we did, which couldn't be duplicated in a studio. A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album,\" said Gregg Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=117}} ''[[At Fillmore East]]'' was recorded over three nights\u2014March 11, 12 and 13, 1971\u2014at the [[Fillmore East]] in New York, for which the band was paid a nightly $1,250.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=117}} ''At Fillmore East'' was released in July 1971 by Capricorn Records as a [[double album]], \"people-priced\" for the cost of a single LP.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=124}} While previous albums by the band had taken months to hit the charts (often near the bottom of the top 200), the record started to climb the charts after a matter of days.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=187}} ''At Fillmore East'' peaked at number 13 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Billboard 200|Top Pop Albums]] chart, and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=187}} The album is considered among the best live albums of all time, and in 2004 was one of the albums selected for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]], deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\" by the [[National Recording Registry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2005/05-087.html|title=Librarian of Congress Names 50 Recordings to the 2004 National Recording Registry|date=April 5, 2005|first=Sheryl|last=Cannady |work=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n===''Eat a Peach'' and Duane Allman's and Berry Oakley's deaths (1971\u20131972)===\n{{See also|Eat a Peach|Brothers and Sisters (album)}}\n\nAlthough suddenly very wealthy and successful, many of the band and its entourage now struggled with [[heroin]] addiction. Four individuals \u2014 group leader [[Duane Allman]], bassist [[Berry Oakley]], and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell \u2014 checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=147}} On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, was killed in a motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a [[flatbed truck]] carrying a lumber crane approached.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his [[Harley-Davidson Sportster]] motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his internal organs.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=210}} Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=160}}\n\nAfter Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; clearly all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=162}} \"We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us\u2014his disciples\u2014that we had to play out,\" said drummer [[Butch Trucks]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=165}} The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=167}} Completing the recording of ''Eat a Peach'' raised each member's spirits; \"The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing ''Eat a Peach'',\" said Allman.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=204}} \"Those last three songs [...] just kinda floated right on out of us [...] The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy\u2014it was still the Allman Brothers Band.\"{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=204}} Released in February 1972, ''[[Eat a Peach]]'' was the band's second hit album, shipping [[RIAA certification|gold]] and peaking at number four on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Billboard 200|Top 200 Pop Albums]] chart.<ref name=\"AM\"/> \"We'd been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever,\" said Gregg Allman.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=210}}\n\nThe band performed nearly 90 shows in the following year, touring as a five-piece.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=173}} The band also purchased 432 acres of land in [[Juliette, Georgia]] for $160,000 and nicknamed it \"the Farm\"; it soon became a group hangout and fulfilled bassist Oakley's communal dreams.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=175}} Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from the death of his friend: he drank excessively and consumed drugs, and was losing weight quickly.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=185}} According to friends and family, he appeared to have lost \"all hope, his heart, his drive, his ambition, [and] his direction\" following Duane's death.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=187}} \"Everything Berry had envisioned for everybody\u2014including the crew, the women and children\u2014was shattered on the day Duane died, and he didn't care after that,\" said [[roadie]] Kim Payne.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=186}} Oakley repeatedly wished to \"get high, be high, and stay high,\" causing quiet concern from all those around him.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=186}} On November 11, 1972, slightly inebriated and overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=189}} He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious.

Gregg Allman was largely living in Los Angeles and dating pop star [[Cher]], and was, according to biographer Alan Paul, \"[becoming] more [[famous for being famous]] than for his music.\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=234}} His vocals were recorded there, as he could not be bothered to return to Macon.<ref name=\"AM\"/> Upon its release, it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor;

the album was a minor commercial success, which was credited to the production work from Dowd.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} Betts filed a lawsuit against Walden for nonpayment of record and publishing royalties, and Betts's lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} Betts won the lawsuit, and the rest of the band filed suit while Capricorn declared bankruptcy that October.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=292}} Massarsky led the successful effort to sign the band with [[Arista Records|Arista]], which pushed the band to \"modernize\" their sound.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} \"[Arista founder] [[Clive Davis]] destroyed any hope that we had that we could make the thing work again,\" said Trucks later. \"He wanted us to be a Southern American version of [[Led Zeppelin]] and brought in outside producers and it just kept getting worse.\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=254}}\n\nTheir first Arista effort, ''[[Reach for the Sky (The Allman Brothers Band album)|Reach for the Sky]]'' (1980), was produced by Nashville songwriters Mike Lawler and Johnny Cobb.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} [[Bonnie Bramlett]], who toured with the band near the end of the decade, sang lead on one song.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=253}} Lawler soon became a part of the band's touring ensemble, incorporating center-stage [[keytar]] solos \"that most fans consider the band's nadir.\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} Drugs remained a problem with the band, particularly among Betts and Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=251}} Although the album was made with the intention of creating a [[hit single]], the genre of [[Southern rock]] was waning considerably in the mainstream.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=254}} The band again grew apart, firing longtime roadie \"Red Dog\" and replacing Jaimoe with [[Dan Toler|Toler]]'s brother Frankie, who had been a member of Great Southern.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=256}} The main point of contention was Jaimoe's insistence that his wife and manager, Candace Oakley (Berry's sister), handle his business affairs.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=256}} \"One of the real blights on the history of the Allman Brothers Band was that Jaimoe, this gentle man, was fired from this organization,\" said Allman later.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=297}} Not long after, \"the band changed managers, hiring the promoter John Scher after Massarsky eased himself out, reportedly saying, 'It's a million-dollar headache and a quarter-million-dollar job.'\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=258}}\n\nFor their second and final album with Arista, ''[[Brothers of the Road]]'' (1981), they collaborated with a \"name producer\" (John Ryan, of [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[the Doobie Brothers]]), who pushed the band even harder to change their sound.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=260}} \"[[Straight from the Heart (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Straight from the Heart]]\" was the album's single, which became a minor hit but heralded the group's last appearance on the top 40 charts.<ref name=\"rs\"/> The band, considering their post-reunion albums \"embarrassing\", subsequently broke up in 1982 after clashing with Clive Davis, who rejected every producer the band suggested for a possible third album, including Tom Dowd and Johnny Sandlin.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=262}} \"We broke up in '82 because we decided we better just back out or we would ruin what was left of the band's image,\" said Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=262}} The band's final performance came on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in January 1982, where they performed \"Southbound\" and \"Leavin{{'\"}}.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=263}} The members regrouped occasionally in the intervening years; in 1986, Betts and Allman toured together, with each opening for one another and collaborating for a set.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=265}} The full Allman Brothers Band--Allman, Betts, Trucks, Jaimoe, Leavell and Dan Toler--also reunited twice in 1986 for the Volunteers Jam and Crackdown on Crack concerts. Allman's solo career began looking up when he released his first solo album in over a decade in 1987, ''[[I'm No Angel (album)|I'm No Angel]]''. The [[I'm No Angel (1987 song)|title track]] became a surprise hit on radio, peaking at No. 49 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 on the magazine's [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=266}}\n\n===Second reunion and heavy touring (1989\u20131996)===\n[[Image:Govt.
