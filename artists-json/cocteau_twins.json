The band's next full-length [[LP record]], ''[[Head over Heels (Cocteau Twins album)|Head over Heels]]'', relied solely on the latter two, following Heggie's amicable departure after the tour that followed the release of ''Peppermint Pig'' (he would later join [[Lowlife (band)|Lowlife]]).<ref name=\"all 2\"/> This led to the characteristic Cocteau Twins sound: Fraser's voice, by turns ethereal and operatic, combined with increasingly effects-heavy guitar playing by Guthrie<ref name=\"all 2\"/> (who has often said that he is far more interested in the way the guitar is recorded than in the actual notes being played, though he later admitted that his reliance on effects and layering was initially due to his own technical limitations).<ref>Paynes, Steph: \"Robin Guthrie\", ''Guitar Player'', 25(2):25\u201326, 1991.</ref>\n\nIn 1983 the band participated in 4AD's [[This Mortal Coil]] project, which spawned a cover version of [[Tim Buckley]]'s \"[[Song to the Siren (Tim Buckley song)|Song to the Siren]]\" (performed by Guthrie and Fraser). Despite appearing under the This Mortal Coil name, the cover has subsequently become one of the best-known Cocteau Twins tracks. During the TMC sessions, Guthrie and Fraser became acquainted with another project contributor, multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde (formerly a member of [[Drowning Craze]]), who joined Cocteau Twins later that year.<ref name=\"all 2\"/>\n\n===Rise to fame, 1984\u20131989===\n{{Listen|filename=Cocteau Twins The spangle-maker.ogg|title=\"The Spangle Maker\"|description=Sample of \"The Spangle Maker\", (1984)}}\n\nWith Raymonde, the band released a series of critically acclaimed albums and EPs that explored their new style. These included ''[[The Spangle Maker]]'' (1984), ''[[Treasure (Cocteau Twins album)|Treasure]]'' (1984), ''[[Aikea-Guinea]]'' (1985), ''[[Tiny Dynamine]]'' (1985), ''[[Echoes in a Shallow Bay]]'' (1985), and ''[[Love's Easy Tears]]'' (1986). Raymonde, who was called in to work on the second album by This Mortal Coil, did not participate in the recording of the fourth Cocteau Twins LP, ''[[Victorialand]]'' (1986), a predominantly acoustic record which featured only Guthrie and Fraser. Raymonde returned to the group for ''[[The Moon and the Melodies]]'' (1986), a collaboration with [[ambient music|ambient]] composer [[Harold Budd]],<ref name=\"all 2\"/> which was not released under the Cocteau Twins name.\n\nIn 1985 4AD signed an agreement with [[Relativity Records]] for distribution of Cocteau Twins releases in the US and other territories.

In 1991, 4AD and Capitol released a box set that compiled the band's EPs from 1982 to 1990, and also included a bonus disc of rare and previously unreleased material.\n\nFraser and Guthrie ended their 13-year relationship in 1993, and by this time had a young child, Lucy Belle, born in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.list.co.uk/the-list/1993-10-08/10/|title=These Childish Things|last1=Bush|first1=Calvin|date=8 October 1993|publisher=The List|access-date=28 June 2019|archive-date=20 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220120071217/https://archive.list.co.uk/the-list/1993-10-08/10/|url-status=live}}</ref> The band's seventh LP, ''[[Four-Calendar Caf\u00e9]]'', their first since Fraser and Guthrie's separation, was released in late 1993.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The band explained that ''Four-Calendar Caf\u00e9'' was a response to the turmoil that had engulfed them in the intervening years, with Guthrie entering rehab and quitting alcohol and drugs, and Fraser undergoing psychotherapy.\n\n===''Milk & Kisses'' and break-up, 1995\u20131997===\n1995 saw the release of two new EPs: ''[[Twinlights]]'' and ''[[Otherness (EP)|Otherness]]''. Some of the tracks on ''Twinlights'' and ''Otherness'' were versions of songs from the band's eighth album, ''[[Milk & Kisses]]'' (1996).<ref name=\"all 2\"/> The record saw the return of more heavily layered guitars, and Fraser began once again to obscure her lyrics, though not entirely. Two singles were taken from the album: \"[[Tishbite (song)|Tishbite]]\" and \"[[Violaine]]\"; both exist in two CD versions, with different [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] included on each. The band, augmented by an extra guitarist and a drummer, toured extensively to support the album, their last for Mercury/Fontana. A new song, \"Touch Upon Touch\", which debuted during the live shows and was recorded later in 1996 was also one of the two songs written and arranged by Fraser, Guthrie and Raymonde for Chinese pop singer [[Faye Wong]] for her Mandarin album ''[[Fuzao]]'' released in June 1996, the other being \"Tranquil Eye\" from ''Violaine'' released in October 1996.\n\nIn 1997, while recording what was to have been their ninth LP, the trio disbanded over irreconcilable differences in part related to the breakup of Guthrie and Fraser. While a number of songs were partially recorded and possibly completed, the band has stated that they will likely never be finished or released in any form.\n\n===Post-breakup===\n[[File:Elizabeth Frazer 2.jpg|thumb|right|Lead singer Elizabeth Fraser performing live in 2006]] \nIn 1999 [[Bella Union]], the record label founded by Guthrie and Raymonde, released a double-CD Cocteau Twins compilation entitled ''[[BBC Sessions (Cocteau Twins album)|BBC Sessions]]''. The collection is a complete record of the band's appearances on UK radio programs from 1982 to 1996, with rare and unreleased material included. In 2000, 4AD released ''[[Stars and Topsoil]]'', a compilation of selected songs picked by the band members that had been released during their years with 4AD; all recordings had been digitally remastered by Guthrie. Finally, in 2003, 4AD followed ''Stars and Topsoil'' with the release of digitally remastered versions of the first six Cocteau Twins [[LP (format)|LPs]].\n\nOn 31 January 2005, Cocteau Twins announced that they would be reforming to perform at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] on 30 April 2005, and later indicated that additional tour dates would be added. However on 16 March, the reunion was cancelled after Fraser announced that she would not take part. In a 2009 interview, Fraser said she could not go through the pain of sharing the stage with her former lover Guthrie, the issue behind the band's 1997 breakup.<ref name=\"GuardianInterview\" /> Raymonde revealed that the band had also booked a 55-date world tour, which would have paid him \u00a31.5 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later in 2005, 4AD released a worldwide limited edition of 10,000 compilation box set titled ''[[Lullabies to Violaine]]'', a 4-disc set that details every single and EP released from 1982 to 1996.

In addition to forming Bella Union, Guthrie and Raymonde have produced releases from new bands signed to that label.\n\nRaymonde released the solo album ''[[Blame Someone Else]]'' as the first release on Bella Union. He also co-produced the posthumous album by [[Billy Mackenzie]] from the [[Associates (band)|Associates]], then went on to produce several [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]] artists like [[James Yorkston]], [[Archie Bronson Outfit]] (whom he later managed) and [[Clearlake (band)|Clearlake]]. More recently he has produced the UK band [[the Duke Spirit]], London-based duo Helene, former Golden Virgins frontman Lucas Renney and has mixed the [[Mercury Prize]] nominated album ''The End of History'' by [[Fionn Regan]]. In his role running Bella Union, he has discovered such artists as [[Laura Veirs]], [[Fleet Foxes]], [[Midlake]], [[Lift to Experience]], [[the Low Anthem]], [[I Break Horses]], [[the Czars]] and [[John Grant (musician)|John Grant]]. The label is renowned for its long-term relationships with its artists, such as [[Beach House]] who have released all four of their albums with Bella Union, as have [[Dirty Three]], Midlake etc. Raymonde picked up the Independent Record Company of the Year award at the Music Week Awards (as voted by UK independent retailers) in 2010, 2012 and 2014.\n\nGuthrie has released five solo albums \u2013 ''Imperial'', ''Continental'', ''Carousel'', ''Emeralds'' and ''Fortune'' \u2013 and five EPs. He toured extensively with his band Violet Indiana, which included ex-Cocteau's guitarist Mitsuo Tate in the line-up.

He has also reunited with Budd to collaborate on two companion CDs, ''Before the Day Breaks'' and ''After the Night Falls'', and the later ''Bordeaux'' and ''Winter Garden'', the latter a collaboration also with Italian electronica artist [[Eraldo Bernocchi]].
