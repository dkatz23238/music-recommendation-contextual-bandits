She explores a variety of different and somewhat unorthodox vocal techniques, such as verses composed entirely of buzzing noises made with the lips and [[beatboxing|beatbox]]-style flourishes in the middle of ballads, and also makes use of such unusual musical techniques as using a drum stick to tap rhythms on the body of a chair.<ref name=\"nypr\"/><ref name=\"block\">{{cite web|last=Block|first=Melissa|date=28 June 2006|title=Stories in Song: Regina Spektor's ''Begin to Hope''|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5518985|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630154806/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5518985|archive-date=2006-06-30|publisher=[[National Public Radio]] \u2013 [[All Things Considered]]}} MP3 audio download linked from archived copy)</ref> Part of her style also results from the exaggeration of certain aspects of vocalization, most notably the [[glottal stop]], prominent in the single \"[[Fidelity (song)|Fidelity]]\". She also uses a strong [[New York accent]] on some words, which she has said is due to her love of New York and its culture.<ref name=\"soundcheck\"/>\n\nSpektor usually sings in English, though she sometimes includes a few words or verses of [[Latin]], Russian, French, or other languages. She plays with pronunciations, which she told NPR was a remnant of her early years when she listened to pop in English without understanding the lyrics.\n\nHer lyrics are equally eclectic, often taking the form of abstract narratives or first-person character studies, similar to [[short story|short stories]] or [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] put to song.<ref name=\"soundcheck\"/><ref name=\"block\"/> Some of Spektor's lyrics include literary allusions,<ref name=\"nypr\"/> such as: [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]] in \"Poor Little Rich Boy\"; ''[[The Little Prince]]'' in \"Baobabs\"; [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] in \"Paris\"; [[Ezra Pound]] and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' in \"Pound of Flesh\"; [[Boris Pasternak]] in \"Apr\u00e8s Moi\"; [[Samson]] and [[Delilah]] in \"[[Samson (Regina Spektor song)|Samson]]\"; ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' in \"Oedipus\"; Edith Wharton's ''[[Ethan Frome]]'' in \"2.99\u00a2 Blues\". Recurring themes and topics in Spektor's lyrics include love, death, religion (particularly biblical and Jewish references), city life (particularly New York references), and certain key phrases which recur in different songs, such as references to [[gravedigger]]s, the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], and the name \"Mary Ann\". Spektor's use of satire is evident in \"Wasteside\", which refers to ''[[The Twelve Chairs]]'', the classic satirical novel by the Soviet authors [[Ilf and Petrov]], and describes the town in which people are born, get their hair cut, and then are sent to the cemetery.\n\nSpektor's first album, ''[[11:11 (Regina Spektor album)|11:11]]'', was recorded and self-released while she was still in college. It differs from Spektor's later releases as she was heavily influenced by [[blues]] and [[jazz]] at the time of its recording. Her second album, ''[[Songs (Regina Spektor album)|Songs]]'', was recorded on Christmas Day, 2001. Each song was recorded with just one take and is entirely acoustic. The session from which the album was derived was not originally intended as an album recording session.<ref>{{cite web|title=Car\u00e1tula Interior Frontal de Regina Spektor - 11:11 - Portada|url=http://www.coveralia.com/caratulas/Regina-Spektor-11-11-Interior1.php|website=Coveralia.com}}</ref> Her third album, ''[[Soviet Kitsch]]'', featured strings on several songs and was her first to feature a full rock band.
