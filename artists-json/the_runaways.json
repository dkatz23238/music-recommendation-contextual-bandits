The band released four studio albums and one live album during its run. Among their best-known songs are \"[[Cherry Bomb (The Runaways song)|Cherry Bomb]]\", \"[[Queens of Noise#\"Hollywood\"|Hollywood]]\", \"[[Queens of Noise#\"Queens of Noise\"|Queens of Noise]]\" and a cover version of [[The Velvet Underground]]'s \"[[Rock & Roll (The Velvet Underground song)|Rock & Roll]]\". Never a major success in the United States, the Runaways became a sensation overseas, especially in Japan, thanks to the single \"Cherry Bomb\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe Runaways were formed in August 1975<ref name=\"TomorrowShow1977\">{{cite episode |series=The Tomorrow Show |series-link=The Tomorrow Show |network=[[NBC]] |date=11 October 1977 |minutes=26 |quote=When we first started, we formed in August of 1975 |author-last=Jett |author-first=Joan}}</ref> by drummer [[Sandy West]] and guitarist [[Joan Jett]] after they had separately introduced themselves to producer [[Kim Fowley]], who gave Jett's phone number to West. Fowley then helped the girls find other members. Two decades later he said, \"I didn't put the Runaways together, I had an idea, they had ideas, we all met, there was combustion and out of five different versions of that group came the five girls who were the ones that people liked.\"<ref name=\"edge\">''Edgeplay: A film about The Runaways'', Sacred Dogs LLC, Los Angeles, 2005 (from interviews with Fowley and Currie)</ref>\n\nStarting as a power trio with singer/bassist [[Micki Steele]], the Runaways began playing the party and club circuit around Los Angeles. They soon added lead guitarist [[Lita Ford]] and Jett switched to rhythm guitar. Steele soon left the group, replaced by bassist Peggy Foster, who left after just one month. Lead singer [[Cherie Currie]] was recruited in a local teen nightclub called the Sugar Shack, followed by [[Jackie Fox]] on bass.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\n=== Fame ===\nThe Runaways were signed to [[Mercury Records]] in 1976 and their debut album, ''[[The Runaways (album)|The Runaways]]'', was released shortly afterward. The band toured the U.S. in support of headlining groups such as [[Cheap Trick]], [[Van Halen]], [[Talking Heads]], and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-953-joan-jett |title=Episode 953 - Joan Jett |date=September 24, 2018 |access-date=September 2, 2019}}</ref> For their stage performance, the documentary ''[[Edgeplay: A Film About the Runaways]]'' (directed by former Runaway bassist [[Vicki Blue]]) revealed each girl patterned herself after their musical idol: Currie on [[David Bowie]], Jett on [[Suzi Quatro]], Ford on a cross between [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Ritchie Blackmore]], West on [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], and Fox on [[Gene Simmons]].<ref name=imdb-edgeplay/>\n\nTheir second album, ''[[Queens of Noise]]'', was released in 1977 and the band performed a world tour in support of the album. The Runaways quickly became lumped in with the growing punk rock movement.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} The band (already fixtures on the West Coast punk scene) formed alliances with mostly male punk bands such as the [[Ramones]] and [[the Dead Boys]] (via New York City's [[CBGB]]) as well as the British punk scene by hanging out with the likes of [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]], [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\nIn the summer of 1977, booking agent [[David Libert]] secured dates in Japan, where they played a string of sold-out shows. They were unprepared for the onslaught of fans that greeted them at the airport. Jett later described the mass hysteria as \"like [[Beatlemania]]\".<ref name=\"imdb-edgeplay\"/> While in Japan, the Runaways had a TV special, did numerous television appearances, and released the album ''[[Live in Japan (The Runaways album)|Live in Japan]]'', which went gold. While in Japan, Fox left the band shortly before the group was scheduled to appear at the 1977 [[Tokyo Music Festival]]. Many years later, she told the ''Telegraph'' her relationship with the band deteriorated after Fowley raped her in front of a roomful of people.<ref>{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Randall |title=Former Runaways members react to Kim Fowley rape allegations |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-runaways-members-kim-fowley-rape-allegations-20150713-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 14, 2015 |access-date=January 29, 2021}}</ref> Jett took over bass duties until the group returned home and recruited Vicki Blue. Currie then left the group after a blow-up with Ford in the fall of 1977.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} Jett, who had previously shared vocals with Currie, took over lead vocals full-time. The band released their fourth album, ''Waitin' for the Night'', and started a world tour in support of the Ramones.\n\n=== Dissolution ===\nDue to disagreements over money and the management of the band, the Runaways and Kim Fowley parted ways in 1977. The group quickly hired Toby Mamis, who worked for [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Suzi Quatro]]. When the group split from Fowley, they also parted with their record label Mercury/[[PolyGram]], to which their deal was tied. In the ''Edgeplay'' documentary, members of the group (especially Fox and Currie) as well as the parents of Currie and West, have accused Fowley, and others assigned to look after the band, of broken promises as to schooling and other care, using divide and conquer tactics to keep control of the band, along with the verbal taunting of band members. The band reportedly spent much time enjoying the excesses of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle during this time.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} They partnered with [[Thin Lizzy]] producer John Alcock, after Jett's future partner [[Kenny Laguna]] turned down the job, to record their last album ''[[And Now... The Runaways]]''.\n\nBlue left the group due to medical problems and was briefly replaced by Laurie McAllister in November 1978. McAllister was referred to the band by her neighbor, Duane Hitchings, who played keyboards on ''And Now... The Runaways''. Before joining the Runaways, McAllister played with \"Baby Roulette and the Rave Ons\", who had one song released on a Kim Fowley compilation LP called ''Vampires From Outer Space''. McAllister appeared onstage with the Runaways at their final shows in California in December 1978 and quit in January 1979.\n\nDisagreement among band members included the musical style; Jett wanted the band to make a musical change, shifting towards [[punk rock]]/[[glam rock]] while Ford and West wanted to continue playing [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Hartmann |first=Graham 'Gruhamed' |title=Lita Ford Plays Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? - Runaways, Family + More |url=http://loudwire.com/lita-ford-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction-runaways-family-more/ |website=Loudwire.com |date=November 5, 2013 |access-date=October 30, 2015}}</ref> Neither would accept the other's point of view.<ref>Sherman, Dale.

People would have just turned their nose up at it.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2021|reason=Mentions interview without evidence of interview}}\n\nIn December 2018, Ford said that a Runaways reunion would never happen and blamed Jett's manager [[Kenny Laguna]] as the reason saying \"Joan Jett is very much in 'Joan Jett land,' I guess you could say. Will she ever come out of Joan Jett land? I don't think so. I think her manager controls that and it's really up to him and her. It seems to me like Joan Jett's manager just runs her life in every way, shape, or form. He's very controlling and he has a real problem with me. He has a real issue with me. He sees me as a threat, which is ridiculous, because she's like my sister and I love Joan. It's ridiculous, it's uncalled for, and it's caused a little bit of rivalry between her and I, which is totally uncalled for. It's his fault. The hard part is just trying to communicate with Joan without her manager involved. We had dinner a couple of years ago, what was supposed to be a girl's night out, and she brought her manager with her. So it's like, dude, answer the question. I'm trying to ask you a question. Are you interested in putting The Runaways back together? She never answered the question.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2021|reason=Mentions statement without source}}\n\nCurrie in May 2021 was asked about a reunion saying \"I've played with all the girls individually, I've played with all of them \u2014 with Lita, with Joan, and, of course, with Sandy; I never did a show without her before she passed away. So I'm the only one that's actually played with all the members. Lita and Joan have a little bit of an issue, and that just seems to be the problem. Lita doesn't like Kenny. I wish they would get over it, honestly, but I don't think so. Kenny was my manager during the early stages of making ''Blvds Of Splendor''. We were very good friends for 20 years. But then, unfortunately, with the record, with them holding up ''Blvds Of Splendor'' for 10 years, that kind of eroded my friendship with him a bit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cherie-currie-wishes-lita-ford-and-joan-jett-would-get-over-their-issues/|title=CHERIE CURRIE Wishes LITA FORD And JOAN JETT 'Would Get Over' Their Issues|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=May 12, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==After the breakup==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = The Runaways after 1979\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Jett Rocks.jpg\n| alt1      = Joan Jett in the 1980s\n| caption1  = Joan Jett in the 1980s\n| image2    = Micki Steele.jpg\n| alt2      = Micki Steele in 2003\n| caption2  = Micki Steele in 2003\n| image3    = Cherie Currie.jpg\n| alt3      = Cherie Currie in 2010\n| caption3  = Cherie Currie in 2010\n| image4    = Lita Ford by Zoran Veselinovic.jpg\n| alt4      = Lita Ford in 1988\n| caption4  = Lita Ford in 1988\n}}\n\n===Joan Jett===\n{{main|Joan Jett}}\nJett went on to work with producer Kenny Laguna and after being rejected by 23 record labels, formed their own label, [[Blackheart Records]], in 1980.

She formed the Sandy West Band and toured California throughout the 1980s and 1990s. She also did session work with [[John Entwistle]] of [[The Who]] and became a drum teacher. West was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2005 and died from it in October 2006. A memorial tribute concert was later held in Los Angeles, featuring the Sandy West Band, Cherie Currie, [[The Bangles]], [[The Donnas]], and [[Carmine Appice|Carmine]] and [[Vinny Appice]], among several others.\n\n===Micki Steele===\n{{main|Micki Steele}}\nSteele (as Michael Steele) joined the band [[The Bangles]] and went on to success with songs such as \"[[Manic Monday]]\", \"[[Walk Like an Egyptian]]\" and \"[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]\".\n\n===Cherie Currie===\n{{main|Cherie Currie}}\nUpon leaving the Runaways, Currie released a 1978 solo album titled ''Beauty's Only Skin Deep'' and a 1980 duet album with her twin sister [[Marie Currie]], ''[[Messin' with the Boys]]'', in which the duo was backed by members of [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. The Curries' cover of [[Russ Ballard]]'s \"[[Since You Been Gone]]\" reached Number 95 on the U.S. chart. Currie also appeared in a number of films, most notably ''[[Foxes (film)|Foxes]]'' with [[Jodie Foster]]. Throughout the 1990s, Currie worked as a drug counselor for addicted teens and as a personal fitness trainer. She married actor [[Robert Hays]] and they had a son together, Jake Hays. The couple divorced in 1997.\n\nCurrie still performs and records, remaining under contract with [[Blackheart Records]], but her current passion is [[chainsaw carving]] which she displays at an art gallery in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth, California]]. In 2013, Cherie recorded two songs with Alexx Michael for the [[Munich]]-based [[hard rock]]-[[glam metal]] group Shameless, which were released on the album ''Beautiful Disaster'' on October 2, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Shameless-Beautiful-Disaster/release/4973423 |title=Shameless (3) - Beautiful Disaster |website=Discogs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=4973423 |title=Images for Shameless (3) - Beautiful Disaster |website=Discogs.com |access-date=October 30, 2015}}</ref> Currie's most recent solo album, ''Blvds of Splendor'', was released in 2020.\n\n===Lita Ford===\n{{main|Lita Ford}}\nFord returned to PolyGram as a solo artist in the 1980s, where she released several albums before pairing with manager [[Sharon Osbourne]]. She had success with songs like \"Kiss Me Deadly\" and \"[[Close My Eyes Forever]]\" (the second a duet with her manager's husband [[Ozzy Osbourne]]). She was married to [[Chris Holmes (musician)|Chris Holmes]] of [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]], and to former [[Nitro (band)|Nitro]] singer [[Jim Gillette]], with whom she has two sons.

The resulting tape found its way to Fowley's desk. He played the Welch tape for colleague and Los Angeles deejay [[Rodney Bingenheimer]], who played the song on his show on radio KROQ and included it on his annual compilation of his most-liked music for the year. Also on that compilation was a song that featured [[Chicago]]-native guitarist Bill Millay.\n\nIt did not take long before Fowley, who still owned the Runaways trademark, was putting together a new Runaways band built around Welch. Missy Bonilla was recruited from the typing pool of CBS Records, Denise Pryor came from Compton and Kathrine Dombrowski (\"Kathy DiAmber\") was also added. Welch was present only on tape and only on the first song on the CD, \"I Want to Run With the Bad Boys\". Millay played guitar, David Carr played keyboards and a drum machine rounded out the team.
