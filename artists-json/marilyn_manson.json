Like the other founding members of the band, his [[stage name]] was formed by combining and juxtaposing the names of two opposing American cultural icons: a [[sex symbol]] and an infamous criminal; in Manson's case, actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[cult]] leader [[Charles Manson]].\n\nManson is best known for music released in the 1990s, including the albums ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'' (1994), ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (1996) and ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998), which earned him a reputation in mainstream media as a controversial figure and negative influence on young people when combined with his public image.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marilyn Manson Concert Canceled |first=Glasgow |last=Greg |url=http://www.thedailycamera.com/shooting/23manson.html |format=[[Broadsheet]] |agency=[[MediaNews Group]] |newspaper=[[Camera (newspaper)|The Daily Camera]]  |date=April 23, 1999 |access-date=May 31, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524090531/http://www.thedailycamera.com/shooting/23manson.html |archive-date=May 24, 2006 }}</ref><ref>Cullen, Dave.

Manson made his film debut as an actor in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Lost Highway (1997 film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), and has since appeared in a variety of minor roles and cameos. In 2002, his first art show, ''The Golden Age of Grotesque'', was held at the [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions]] center.\n\nHe is widely considered one of the most controversial figures in [[heavy metal music]], and has been involved in numerous controversies throughout his career. His lyrics were criticized by American politicians and were examined in [[congressional hearing]]s. Several U.S. states enacted legislation specifically banning the group from performing in state-operated venues. In 1999, news media [[Marilyn Manson\u2013Columbine High School massacre controversy|falsely blamed Manson for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre]]. His work has been cited in several other violent events; his paintings and films appeared as evidence in a [[Murder of Jodi Jones|murder trial]], and he has been accused of inspiring several other murders and school shootings.
