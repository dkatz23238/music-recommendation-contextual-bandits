The band originally consisted of [[Brad Arnold]] (lead vocals, drums), Matt Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Todd Harrell (bass guitar). The band rose to international fame with their first single, \"[[Kryptonite (3 Doors Down song)|Kryptonite]]\", which placed in the top three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The band then signed with [[Republic Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[The Better Life]]'', in 2000. The album was the 11th-best-selling album of the year and was certified [[RIAA certification|6\u00d7 platinum]] in the United States. The group was later joined by drummer Richard Liles, who played during the tour for their first album.\n\nThe band's second album, ''[[Away from the Sun]]'' (2002), continued the band's success; it debuted at No.&nbsp;8 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, went multi-platinum in the U.S. like its predecessor, and spawned the hits \"[[When I'm Gone (3 Doors Down song)|When I'm Gone]]\" and \"[[Here Without You]]\". The band toured extensively for two years. [[Daniel Adair]] played drums on tour from 2002 to 2006. This configuration played nearly 1,000 shows across the world following the release of ''Away from the Sun''. In 2005, Greg Upchurch ([[Puddle of Mudd]]) joined to play drums to replace Adair. 3 Doors Down released their third album, ''[[Seventeen Days]]'', in 2005. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum within one month of release. The band continued their success with their next two albums, ''[[3 Doors Down (album)|3 Doors Down]]'' (2008) and ''[[Time of My Life (3 Doors Down album)|Time of My Life]]'' (2011), debuting at No.&nbsp;1 and No.&nbsp;3 respectively on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. Their latest album, ''[[Us and the Night]]'', was released in 2016; they were working on new material for a seventh studio album as of 2019.<ref name=tsm>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/aug/15/3-doors-downs-brad-arnold-talks-changing-industry-/|title=3 Doors Down's Brad Arnold talks changing industry, new music|last=Podplesky|first=Azaria|date=August 15, 2019|website=The Spokesman|language=en|access-date=June 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band has been primarily described as [[post-grunge]] and [[alternative rock]], while occasionally crossing into [[hard rock]], and [[Southern rock]].

He was replaced by Chet Roberts, who was formerly Chris Henderson's guitar tech.

The band began to tour outside [[Escatawpa, Mississippi]], eventually coming up with their official name during a trip to [[Foley, Alabama]]. When the three were walking through the town, they saw a building where some letters had fallen off its sign, reading \"Doors Down\". Since the band consisted of three people at the time, they added the \"3\" to create \"3 Doors Down\". The cover of their 2011 album ''[[Time of My Life (3 Doors Down album)|Time of My Life]]'' hints at the original number of band members (3) and current band members (5); the clock on the album cover reads 3:05.\n\nA couple of years after performing together, Todd Harrell asked rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson to join the band in 1998. 3 Doors Down recorded a demo CD of their original songs at Lincoln Recording in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]. When the band gave the CD to local radio station [[WCPR-FM]], they started playing the [[extended play|EP]] version of \"[[Kryptonite (3 Doors Down song)|Kryptonite]]\" and it became the No.&nbsp;1 requested song on the station for over 15 weeks.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The station's program director sent the song to manager Phin Daly who in turn showed it to Bill McGathy, his employer at In De Goot Entertainment. The band was booked in New York to perform a showcase at the [[CBGB]] music club. Daly told [[HitQuarters]]: \"Once they got on stage and started playing it was apparent the magic was in the music. So we moved to sign them.\"<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Phin_Daly_Interview.html|title=Interview with Phin Daly|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=November 1, 2001|access-date=February 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711171926/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Phin_Daly_Interview.html|archive-date=July 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Mainstream success: 1999\u20132004===\n3 Doors Down's first studio album, ''[[The Better Life]]'', was released on February 8, 2000, and went on to become the 11th best-selling album of the year, selling over three million copies. It has since been certified 6\u00d7 platinum, thanks in large part to the international hit singles, \"Kryptonite\", \"[[Loser (3 Doors Down song)|Loser]]\", and \"[[Duck and Run]]\". A fourth single, \"[[Be Like That (3 Doors Down song)|Be Like That]]\" was re-recorded for the 2001 film ''[[American Pie 2]]'', with alternate lyrics for the first three lines; this version is known as the \"''American Pie 2'' Edit\". Whilst recording the album, Brad Arnold recorded both the vocal and drum tracks. The band hired drummer Richard Liles for the tour in support of ''The Better Life'' so that Arnold could perform at the front of the stage. Liles left in late 2001.\n\nThe band's second studio album, ''[[Away from the Sun]]'', was released on November 12, 2002, and went platinum within two months of release.<ref>Larkin, C.

[[Rush (band)|Rush]] guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]] produced and performed on three tracks for the record, \"Dangerous Game\", \"Dead Love\", and \"Wasted Me\", but only \"Dangerous Game\" would appear on the finished product. The band hired Canadian [[Daniel Adair]] to play drums for the ''Away From the Sun'' tour. He would go on to record the drums for the band's next studio release, and was with the band aboard the [[USS George Washington (CVN-73)|USS ''George Washington'' (CVN-73)]] to film the music video \"When I'm Gone\".\n\nIn 2003, 3 Doors Down released a live EP entitled ''[[Another 700 Miles]]'' consisting of recordings from a live performance by the band in Chicago, Illinois. ''Another 700 Miles'' has since been certified Gold in the United States. In addition to featuring some of 3 Doors Down's hit singles from their previous two albums, the EP also contains a version of the popular 1977 [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] song \"[[That Smell]]\". The group toured with [[Nickelback]] in 2004.<ref>Waddel, R. (May 29, 2004). Hopes high for 3 Doors Down/Nickelback. Billboard.

During the ''Seventeen Days'' tour, the band appeared alongside southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, as well as headlining many shows of their own.\n\nLater in 2005, the band released a live DVD entitled ''Away from the Sun: Live from Houston, Texas''. The DVD was produced and directed by [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[Alex Gibney]] and Doug Biro.

The judge stated that Harrell \"got 360 Oxycodone and 60 Oxycontin pills from his doctor in less than 30 days, which is well outside the amount that is usually prescribed in the due course of medical treatment\". Harrell was also charged with bringing a controlled substance into a correctional detention facility after it was discovered during the booking process at Nashville's Metro Jail that Harrell had a plastic bag hidden in his sock that contained eight [[Xanax]] pills, twenty four [[Oxycodone]] pills, and four [[Oxymorphone]] pills. Harrell's court and trial dates have been repeatedly postponed by Harrell's attorneys for various reasons, including a rehab stay.

Also, in connection with Wal-Mart, they were able to supply the town with three semi-trucks full of rescue supplies. There was also extensive support from TBLF in providing funding for rebuilding efforts in the town.\n\n3 Doors Down and The Better Life Foundation host a yearly show to raise money for the charity. Beginning in 2010, the show is performed at Horseshoe Hotel and Casino, in Tunica, Mississippi.  Prior to 2010, the show was performed at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi. In addition to a concert from 3 Doors Down and friends, there is also an auction, which includes numerous items from musical friends, sports icons, and other various supporters of the band and the charity. There is an average of sixty items auctioned off yearly, and proceeds are given to TBLF.
