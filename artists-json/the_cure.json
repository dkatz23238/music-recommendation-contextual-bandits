The band's debut album, ''[[Three Imaginary Boys]]'' (1979), along with several early singles, placed the band in the [[post-punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] movements that had sprung up in the United Kingdom. Beginning with their second album, ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'' (1980), the band adopted a new, increasingly dark and tormented style, which, together with Smith's stage look, had a strong influence on the emerging genre of [[gothic rock]] as well as [[gothic subculture|the subculture]] that eventually formed around the genre. \n\nAfter the release of the band's fourth album, ''[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]'' (1982), Smith introduced a greater [[Pop music|pop]] sensibility into the band's music, and they subsequently garnered worldwide mainstream success.

The Cure have released 13 studio albums, two [[extended play|EPs]], over 30 singles, and have sold over 30 million albums worldwide.

An early ''[[NME]]'' article on the band wrote that the Cure \"are like a breath of fresh suburban air on the capital's smog-ridden pub-and-club circuit\", and noted: \"With a [[John Peel]] session and more extensive London gigging on their immediate agenda, it remains to be seen whether the Cure can retain their refreshing [[joie de vivre]].\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Thrills |first= Adrian |date= 16 December 1978 |title= Ain't No Blues for the Summertime Cure |journal= [[NME]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Cure released their debut album ''[[Three Imaginary Boys]]'' in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer [[Mike Hedges]] took control of the recording.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=84}} The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted: \"a lot of it was very superficial \u2013 I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it.\"<ref name=\"Spin 1987\">{{cite journal |last= Sweeting |first= Adam |date= July 1987 |title= The Cure \u2013 Curiouser and Curiouser |journal= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] }}</ref> The band's second single, [[Boys Don't Cry (The Cure song)|\"Boys Don't Cry\"]], was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' ''[[Join Hands]]'' promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double-duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when [[John McKay (musician)|John McKay]] quit the group in Aberdeen.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp= 105}} That musical experience had a strong impact on him: \"On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the [[Buzzcocks]] or [[Elvis Costello]]; the punk [[The Beatles|Beatles]].

Soon afterwards, Dempsey was dropped from the band because of his cold reception to material Smith had written for the upcoming album.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p= 106}} Dempsey joined the [[Associates (band)|Associates]], while [[Simon Gallup]] (bass) and [[Matthieu Hartley]] (keyboards) from [[The Magazine Spies|the Magspies]] joined the Cure.

And it seemed like we were trying to be more obscure. We just didn't like the standard rock thing. The whole thing really got out of hand.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Morley |first=Paul |author-link=Paul Morley |date=12 July 1980 |title=Days of Wine and Poses |journal=[[NME]]}}</ref> That same year ''Three Imaginary Boys'' was repackaged for the American market as ''[[Boys Don't Cry (The Cure album)|Boys Don't Cry]]'', with new artwork and a modified track list. The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases. At the end of the tour, Matthieu Hartley left the band. Hartley said, \"I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal, sombre music\u2014the sort of thing that didn't interest me at all.\"{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=126}}\n\nThe band reconvened with Hedges to produce their third album, ''[[Faith (The Cure album)|Faith]]'' (1981), which furthered the dour mood present on ''Seventeen Seconds''.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=132}} The album peaked at number 14 on the UK charts.<ref name=\"Guinness\"/> Included with cassette copies of ''Faith'' was an instrumental soundtrack for ''[[Carnage Visors]]'', an animated film shown in place of an opening act for the band's 1981 Picture Tour.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=136}} In late 1981 the Cure released the non-album single \"[[Charlotte Sometimes (song)|Charlotte Sometimes]]\". By this point, the sombre mood of the music had a profound effect on the attitude of the band and they were \"stuck in a ghoulish rut\". Sometimes Smith would be so absorbed by the persona he projected onstage he would leave at the end in tears.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=141}}\n\nIn 1982 the Cure recorded and released ''[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]'', the third and final album of an \"oppressively dispirited\" trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging [[gothic rock]] genre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Reynolds |year=2005 |title=[[Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978\u20131984]] |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/ripitupstartagai00reyno/page/358 358] |isbn=0-14-303672-6 }}</ref> Smith has said that during the recording of ''Pornography'' he was \"undergoing a lot of mental stress. But it had nothing to do with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about ''Pornography''. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time\".<ref name=\"Spin 1987\"/> Gallup described the album by saying, \"[[Nihilism]] took over ... We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time.\"{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=161}} Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer [[Phil Thornalley]] to polish the track \"[[The Hanging Garden (song)|The Hanging Garden]]\" for release as a single.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp=158\u201359}} Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, ''Pornography'' became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight.<ref name=\"Guinness\"/>\n\nThe release of ''Pornography'' was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their [[trademark look|signature look]] of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp=166\u201367}} The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=171}} Smith rejoined [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] as their lead guitarist in November 1982.<ref>{{cite web |title=Siouxsie And The Banshees: \"We were losing our minds\" |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/siouxsie-and-the-banshees-we-were-losing-our-minds-2572 |website=Uncut |access-date=18 September 2019 |date=24 October 2014}}</ref> He subsequently became a full-time member of the band, and was featured on the live video and album ''[[Nocturne (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Nocturne]]''.

In December 1982, Smith remarked to ''[[Melody Maker]]'', \"Do the Cure really exist any more? I've been pondering that question myself ... it has got to a point where I don't fancy working in that format again.\" He added, \"Whatever happens, it won't be me, Laurence and Simon together any more.

Parry managed to convince Smith and Tolhurst of the idea; Parry said, \"It appealed to Robert because he wanted to destroy the Cure anyway.\"{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=174}} With Tolhurst now playing keyboards instead of drums, the duo released the single \"[[Let's Go to Bed (The Cure song)|Let's Go to Bed]]\" in late 1982.
