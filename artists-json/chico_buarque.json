He is best known for his music, which often includes social, economic, and cultural reflections on Brazil.\n\nThe firstborn son of [[S\u00e9rgio Buarque de Hollanda]], Buarque lived at several locations throughout his childhood, though mostly in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and [[Rome]]. He wrote and studied literature as a child and found music through the [[bossa nova]] compositions of [[Antonio Carlos Jobim|Tom Jobim]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]]. He performed as a singer and guitarist in the 1960s as well as writing a play that was deemed dangerous by the Brazilian military dictatorship of the time. Buarque, along with several [[Tropic\u00e1lia|Tropicalist]] and [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira|MPB]] musicians, was threatened by the [[Brazilian military government]] and eventually left Brazil for Italy in 1969. However, he came back to Brazil in 1970, and continued to record, perform, and write, though much of his material was suppressed by government censors. He released several more albums in the 1980s and published three novels in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nIn 2019, Buarque was awarded the [[Cam\u00f5es Prize]], the most important prize for literature in the Portuguese language.\n\n==Early life and career ==\n\nBuarque was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 19 June 1944. He came from an intellectually privileged family background\u2014his father [[S\u00e9rgio Buarque de Holanda]] was a well-known historian, sociologist and journalist and his mother [[Maria Am\u00e9lia Ces\u00e1rio Alvim]] was a painter and pianist. He is also brother of the singer [[Mi\u00facha]] and politician [[Ana de Hollanda]]. As a child, he was impressed by the musical style of [[bossa nova]], specifically the work of [[Tom Jobim]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]]. He was also interested in writing, composing his first short story at 18&nbsp;years old<ref name=lion>{{cite news |first=Jemima |last=Hunt |title=The lionised king of Rio |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,,1263492,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=July 18, 2004 |access-date=March 24, 2008 }}</ref> and studying European literature, also at a young age.<ref name=haan>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistinterviews.eu/?page_id=12&parent_id=22/ |title=Chico Buarque |access-date=March 24, 2008 |last=de Haan |first=Maarten |date=August 2006 |work=Artist Interviews }}</ref> One of his most consuming interests, however, was playing football, beginning at age four, and he still played regularly in his 60s.<ref name=haan/> During his childhood, he lived in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rome.\n\nBefore becoming a musician, Buarque decided at one point to study architecture at the [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]], but this choice did not lead to a career in that field; Buarque often skipped classes.<ref name=amg>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p3228/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography |access-date=March 23, 2008 |last=Dougan |first=John |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[All Media Guide]] }}</ref>\n[[File:Chico Buarque cantando na TV Rio.tif|left|thumb|251x251px|Chico Buarque in TV Rio, 1967.

Buarque had his first hit with \"[[A Banda (Ah Bahn-da)|A Banda]]\" in 1966, written about a marching band, and soon released several more singles.<ref name=haan/> Although playing bossa nova, during his career, samba and [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]] would also be widely explored. Despite that, Buarque was criticized by two of the leading musicians at the time, [[Caetano Veloso]] and [[Gilberto Gil]] as they believed his musical style was overly conservative.<ref name=amg/> However, an existentially themed play that Buarque wrote and composed in 1968, ''Roda Viva'' (\"Live Circle\"), was frowned upon by the military government and Buarque served a short prison sentence because of it.<ref name=amg/> He left Brazil for Italy for 18 months in 1970, returning to write his first novel in 1972, which was not targeted by censors.<ref name=lion/>\n[[File:Chico Buarque.jpg|thumb|right|Chico Buarque performs in 2007.]]\nAt this time his thinly veiled protest single \"Apesar de Voc\u00ea\" (\"In spite of You\" \u2013 in reference to the military dictatorship) was also produced.<ref>{{cite journal |last=de Sousa |first=Dolores Puga Alves |year=2004 |title=Os Sessenta Anos de um Artista: \"Chico Buarque do Brazil\", Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o de Rinaldo de Fernandes |journal=F\u00eanix: Revista de Hist\u00f3ria e Estudos Culturais |volume=1 |issue=1 |issn=1807-6971 |language=pt}}</ref> \"Apesar de Voc\u00ea\" was overlooked by the military censors, becoming an important anthem in the democratic movement. After selling over 100,000 copies, the single was eventually censored and removed from the market. At one point in 1974, the censors banned any song authored by Chico Buarque. Then, he created a pseudonym, naming himself \"Julinho da Adelaide\", complete with life history and interviews to newspapers. \"Julinho da Adelaide\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicobuarque.com.br/sanatorio/abre_julinho.htm |title=Julinho da Adelaide |publisher=Chico Buarque |access-date=July 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207173824/http://www.chicobuarque.com.br/sanatorio/abre_julinho.htm |archive-date=December 7, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> authored songs such as \"Jorge Maravilha\" and \"Acorda amor\" before he was outed in a ''[[Jornal do Brasil]]'' news story.<ref>{{cite book |last=Motta |first=Nelson |author-link=Nelson Motta |title=Noites Tropicais \u2013 Solos, Improvisos e Mem\u00f3rias Musicais |year=2000 |publisher=Editora Objetiva |location=[[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil |language=pt |isbn=85-7302-292-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/noitestropicaiss00mott }}</ref> Buarque also wrote a play named ''Calabar'', about the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch invasion of Brazil]] in the seventeenth century, drawing parallels with the military regime.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Martins |first=Christian Alves |date=2007 |title=Tempos de Intoler\u00e2ncia: Chico conta Calabar |journal=F\u00eanix: Revista de Hist\u00f3ria e Estudos Culturais |volume=4 |issue=3 |url=http://www.revistafenix.pro.br/vol1christian.php?PHPSESSID=7ea35a2912813498997d554b31e66f3a |access-date= March 23, 2008 |issn=1807-6971 |language=pt}}</ref> Despite the censorship, songs such as \"Samba de Orly\" (1970), \"Acorda amor\" (1974, as \"Julinho da Adelaide\") manifested Buarque's continuing opposition to the military regime.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, he collaborated with filmmakers, playwrights, and musicians in further protest works against the dictatorship. Buarque approached the 1983 Concert for Peace in Nicaragua as a valid forum to vocalize his strong political views. Throughout the decade, he crafted many of his songs as vehicles to describe the re-democratization of Brazil. The Concert for Peace in Nicaragua was one in a concert series known as the \"Central American Peace Concerts.\" These concerts featured various [[Latin American]] artists. The political turmoil that plagued this era were expressed in many of Buarque's songs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=B\u00e9hague |first=Gerard |date=Spring\u2013Summer 2006 |title=Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985\u201395) |journal=Latin American Music Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=79\u201390 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/latin_american_music_review/v027/27.1behague08.html |doi=10.1353/lat.2006.0021 |s2cid=191430137 |author-link=B\u00e9hague, Gerard }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Gonzalez |first=Mike |date=May 1987 |title=April in Managua: The Central American Peace Concert |journal=Popular Music |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=247\u2013249 |doi=10.1017/S0261143000006061 |jstor=853429|s2cid=161149412 }}</ref> He later wrote ''Budapeste'', a novel that achieved critical national acclaim and won the [[Pr\u00eamio Jabuti]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Chico Buarque ganha Pr\u00eamio Jabuti com Budapeste |url=http://www.cbl.org.br/content.php?recid=1342&type=N |work=[[O Globo]] |publisher=C\u00e2mara Brasileira do Livro |date=September 10, 2004 |access-date=March 23, 2008 |language=pt }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> a Brazilian literary award comparable to the [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\nHis 2017 album ''[[Caravanas]]'' was elected the 3rd best Brazilian album of that year by the Brazilian edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name=\"rsbmelhores2017\">{{cite magazine |title=Melhores Discos Nacionais de 2017 |url=https://rollingstone.uol.com.br/galeria/melhores-discos-nacionais-de-2017/|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] Brasil |publisher=Grupo Spring de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o |access-date=25 January 2019 |date=2017}}</ref>\n\n==\"C\u00e1lice\"==\nFollowing the [[Brazilian military coup of 1964]], Buarque avoided censorship by using cryptic analogies and wordplay.
