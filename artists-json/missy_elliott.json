Maura Johnson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described \"Cool Off\" as calling \"back to hip-hop's two-turntables-and-a-mic early days\". \"DripDemeanor\" has been described as a slow jam that explores Elliott's \"sensuous side\". Musically, it contains \"plush synths [that] skip-step underneath\" the song's beat. \"Why I Still Love You\" is a [[doo-wop]] song with [[Gospel music|gospel]] influences and jazz influence that lyrically chronicles the singer's \"conflicted emotions about holding on to a cheating lover\". The EP closes with an [[a cappella]] version of \"Why I Still Love You\".\n\nElliott was motivated to write uplifting music to counter mainstream trends and encourage more [[dance music]] to feel good. \"DripDemeanor\" was released as the album's second single on October 22. \"Why I Still Love You\" was released as the third single on January 17, 2020. \"Cool Off\" was released as the fourth and final single from the EP on April 21, 2020.\n\nOn June 26, 2020, Elliott appeared on the official remix to [[Toni Braxton]]'s single \"[[Do It (Toni Braxton song)|Do It]]\".\nElliott co-produced the track alongside Hannon Lane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/gb/album/do-it-single/1519291115|title=Do It (Remix) featuring Missy Elliott|work=[[iTunes]]|date=June 26, 2020|access-date=June 28, 2020|archive-date=July 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729221736/https://music.apple.com/gb/album/do-it-single/1519291115|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn August 13, 2020, Elliott appeared on the remix single \"[[Levitating (song)|Levitating]]\" by [[Dua Lipa]] which also featured [[Madonna]].
