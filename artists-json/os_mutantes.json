They released their acclaimed [[Os Mutantes (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1968. The band is considered to be one of the main groups of [[Brazilian rock]]. Heavily influenced by Anglo-American [[psychedelic pop]],<ref>[http://www.luakabop.com/os_mutantes/cmp/sergio2.html S\u00e9rgio Dias Interview]</ref> they bridged Brazilian sensibilities together with studio trickery, [[guitar feedback|feedback]], [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], and [[musique concr\u00e8te]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bush |first1=John |title=Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/os-mutantes-mn0000488378/biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=25 December 2021}}</ref>\n\nOs Mutantes debuted their work in [[1966]], as a trio, when they presented themselves in the program ''O Pequeno Mundo de Ronnie Von'' of [[TV Record]]. The group was christened ''Mutantes'' by [[Ronnie Von]] himself, right before their first TV appearance. The group until then used call themselves ''Os Bruxos'' (meaning ''The Witches'', in Portuguese) and the suggestion came from the book ''Emperor of the Mutants'', by [[Stefan Wul]] (the book's original title in french is ''La Mort Vivante''). The group quickly became one of the main figures of the \"new MPB\" (popular brazilian music), influenced by [[Tropic\u00e1lia]], until their breakup in [[1978]], only with S\u00e9rgio Dias as an original member. Throughout these twelve years, nine albums were recorded, although two of them - ''[[O A e o Z]]'' and ''[[Tecnicolor]]'' - were only released in the [[1990s]]. It was during this decade that the importance of Os Mutantes was recognized, by both national and international rock, as one of the most creative dynamic, radical and talented groups of the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] era.\n\nAlthough the original line-up ([[Rita Lee]], [[Arnaldo Baptista]] and [[S\u00e9rgio Dias]]; and later with [[Liminha (musician)|Liminha]] and Dinho Leme) made the most notable breakthrough for the group, it has gone through numerous personnel changes throughout its existence. After a hiatus from the late 1970s to the early 2000s, the band reunited in 2006, touring and recording new material.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nOs Mutantes was formed in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1966 by two brothers: [[Arnaldo Baptista]] (bass, keyboards and vocals) and [[S\u00e9rgio Dias|S\u00e9rgio Dias Baptista]] (guitar and vocals), and lead singer [[Rita Lee]]. They were originally named Six Sided Rockers.<ref name=amg>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p312117/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography |access-date=2008-03-29 |last=Bush |first=John |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[All Media Guide]] }}</ref> The Baptistas' father was a poet and mother a pianist,<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |first=Will |last=Hodgkinson |author-link=Will Hodgkinson |title='Why be normal?' |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1777371,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2006-05-18 |access-date=2008-03-29 }}</ref> and the two had previously had an all-male band called The Wooden Faces, while Lee was in an all-female band called The Teenage Singers. S\u00e9rgio Dias' guitar, the Golden Guitar (Guitarra de Ouro), was created by Arnaldo and S\u00e9rgio's brother, Cl\u00e1udio C\u00e9sar Dias Baptista, who built many of their instruments and electronic effects.<ref name=LB-Sergio-2>[http://www.luakabop.com/os_mutantes/cmp/sergio2.html Interview with Os Mutantes guitarist S\u00e9rgio Dias], Luakabop.com</ref><ref name=LB-Rita>[http://www.luakabop.com/os_mutantes/cmp/rita.html Interview with Os Mutantes singer Rita Lee], Luakabop.com</ref> Their current name was settled upon immediately before a performance on a Brazilian television program.<ref name=clique>{{cite web |url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/en/Artists/Artists.asp?Status=ARTISTA&Nu_Artista=414 |title=Mutantes |access-date=2008-03-29 |work=AllBrazilianMusic |publisher=CliqueMusic Editora |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210129092159/http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/artistas/ver/mutantes |archive-date=2021-01-29}}</ref>\n\n===Tropic\u00e1lia===\n{{Main|Tropic\u00e1lia}}\n\nThrough other TV performances, the band was able to meet [[Gilberto Gil]], an influential musician in the [[Tropicalismo|Tropic\u00e1lia]] movement, who brought them into the movement's circle.<ref name=clique/> Os Mutantes released two albums heavily influenced by Tropic\u00e1lia, which blended [[psychedelic rock]] with other forms of art. They performed and recorded with many artists of this period, including [[Caetano Veloso]] and Gilberto Gil, before Veloso and Gil were arrested and subsequently exiled by the [[History of Brazil (1964\u20131985)|military government of Brazil]] in early 1969. During this period, Os Mutantes was also threatened by the [[History of Brazil (1964\u20131985)|military government of Brazil]] of that time.<ref name=trip>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Rohter |author-link=Larry Rohter |title=Brazil's Musical Mutants Resume Their Strange Trip |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/arts/music/15roht.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]] |date=2007-07-15 |access-date=2008-03-29 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1967 Os Mutantes backed Gilberto Gil when he competed in the third annual Festival of Brazilian Popular Music, making Brazilian music history by being one of the first two rock groups to participate, and Gil won second prize in the song competition with his song \"Domingo no Parque\" (\"Sunday in the Park\"). Gil's friend Caetano Veloso also performed with a rock group, S\u00e3o Paulo band Beat Boys, and although his unorthodox performance met with some initial resistance, he eventually won over the crowd with his song \"Alegria, Alegria\", which was awarded fourth place in the competition. The next year Os Mutantes collaborated with Gilberto Gil on his [[Gilberto Gil (1968 album)|second solo album]], and they also contributed to the manifesto work of the Tropic\u00e1lia movement, the landmark 1968 album ''[[Tropic\u00e1lia: ou Panis et Circencis]]'' (''Tropic\u00e1lia: or Bread and Circuses'') a collaborative album recorded by all the major figures in the movement, including Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gll, Caetano Veloso, [[Gal Costa]], and [[Tom Z\u00e9]], with orchestrations by [[Rogerio Duprat]] and lyrical contributions from [[Torquato Neto]].\n\nIn sharp contrast to their well-received festival appearance in 1967, the group famously met with intense hostility when they backed Caetano Veloso for his two now-legendary performances at the third International Song Festival in Rio, which caused a near-riot. In the first round of the festival's song competition on 12 September 1968, Veloso and Os Mutantes were loudly jeered, booed and insulted by a large group of students in the audience, who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalists' musical experiments, and who were further infuriated by Veloso's outlandish costume, and his provocatively sexual stage movements. In the second round of the competition on 15 September, Veloso and Os Mutantes performed a wild new psychedelic piece that Veloso had written for the occasion, called \"\u00c9 proibido proibir\" (\"It Is Forbidden to Forbid\"); this was recorded live and an excerpt was later released as the b-side of the studio recording of the single. The students began heckling even before the ensemble took the stage, and throughout the song, the anti-Tropicalist faction in the audience jeered and booed so loudly that the performers could barely be heard. The students also began throwing eggs, fruit, vegetables and paper balls and a section of the audience stood up and turned their backs on the performers, to which Os Mutantes responded by turning their backs to the audience. Os Mutantes continued playing, but Veloso stopped singing and spontaneously launched into an impassioned diatribe, denouncing the student faction for their conservatism, which provoked even louder howls of disapproval from the audience. Although the ensemble was joined on stage by [[Gilberto Gil]], who came out to show his support, the jeering continued unabated, so Veloso angrily declared that he would no longer participate in the competition; he then finished the song deliberately out of tune, and he, Gilberto and Os Mutantes left the stage arm-in-arm.<ref>Victoria Langland, \"Il est Interdit d\u2019Interdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil\", ''Estudios Interdisciplinarios de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006)</ref>\n\n===Mid-seventies===\nIn 1971, bassist Arnolpho Lima Filho (\"Liminha\") and drummer Ronaldo Leme (\"Dinho\") officially joined the band. They released five albums together before Lee departed in 1972 to start a solo career.<ref name=trip/> Rita Lee's 1972 album ''[[Hoje \u00c9 o Primeiro Dia do Resto da Sua Vida]]'' was actually recorded with Os Mutantes but credited to Rita Lee due to record company disagreements.  Subsequently, the band moved in a [[progressive rock]] direction with the album ''[[O A e o Z]]'', recorded in 1973 but released only in 1992 due to disagreement with the record company. Arnaldo left the band in that year to pursue a solo career due to differences with other band members and problems with the abuse of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], followed by Dinho and, a year later, Liminha. Arnaldo subsequently was institutionalized and jumped from the building's window, causing a six-week coma.<ref name=guardian/> S\u00e9rgio Dias, the only remaining original member, led the band until its dissolution in 1978. During this time, they released one more studio album, a live album and an EP. Two unreleased albums were released many years later, the aforementioned ''O A e o Z'' and ''[[Tecnicolor]]'' recorded in 1970 and released in 2000.\n\n===Reunion===\nOs Mutantes (Arnaldo, S\u00e9rgio and Dinho, ''sans'' Rita Lee and Liminha&mdash;Lee was replaced with Z\u00e9lia Duncan on vocals) played live for the first time since 1978 at the Tropicalia exhibition at [[London]]'s [[Barbican Arts Centre]] on May 22, 2006. This performance, which was first by drummer Dinho Leme since the end of Os Mutantes, was followed by shows in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]] (with [[the Flaming Lips]]), [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Chicago]], and [[Miami, Florida|Miami]].\n[[File:Os mutantes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Os Mutantes in 2010.]]\nThey have also collaborated with British DJ JD Twitch, in a Britain/Brazil culture project in 2007, called [[Trocabrahma]].
