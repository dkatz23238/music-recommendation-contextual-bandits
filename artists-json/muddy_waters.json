In 1946, he recorded his first records for [[Columbia Records]] and then for [[Aristocrat Records]], a newly formed label run by the brothers [[Leonard Chess|Leonard]] and [[Phil Chess]].\n\nIn the early 1950s, Muddy Waters and his band\u2014[[Little Walter Jacobs]] on harmonica, [[Jimmy Rogers]] on guitar, [[Elga Edmonds]] (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums and [[Otis Spann]] on piano\u2014recorded several blues classics, some with the bassist and songwriter [[Willie Dixon]]. These songs included \"[[Hoochie Coochie Man]],\" \"[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]\" and \"[[I'm Ready (Muddy Waters song)|I'm Ready]]\". In 1958, he traveled to England, laying the foundations of the resurgence of interest in the  blues there. His performance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1960 was recorded and released as his first live album, ''[[At Newport 1960]]''.\n\nMuddy Waters' music has influenced various [[Music of the United States|American music]] genres, including [[rock and roll]] and [[rock music]].\n\n==Early life==\nMuddy Waters' place and date of birth are not conclusively known. He stated that he was born in 1915 in [[Rolling Fork, Mississippi|Rolling Fork]] in [[Sharkey County, Mississippi]], but other evidence suggests that he was born in the unincorporated community of Jug's Corner, in neighboring [[Issaquena County, Mississippi|Issaquena County]], in 1913.{{sfn|Gordon|2002|p=3}} In the 1930s and 1940s, before his rise to fame, the year of his birth was reported as 1913 on his marriage license, recording notes, and musicians' union card. A 1955 interview in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' is the earliest in which he stated 1915 as the year of his birth, and he continued to say this in interviews from that point onward. The 1920 census lists him as five years old as of March 6, 1920. The Social Security Death Index, relying on the Social Security card application submitted after his move to Chicago in the mid-1940s, lists him as being born April 4, 1913. His gravestone gives his birth year as 1915.<ref>{{Find a Grave|4157|name=Muddy Waters}}</ref>\n\nHis grandmother, Della Grant, raised him after his mother died shortly after his birth.

I was a good Baptist, singing in the church. So I got all of my good moaning and trembling going on for me right out of church,\"{{sfn|Szatmary|2014|p=8}} he recalled. By the time he was 17, he had purchased his first guitar. \"I sold the last horse that we had.

Williams recounted to Blewett Thomas that he eventually dropped Muddy \"because he was takin' away my women [fans]\".\n\nIn August 1941,<ref name=\"PBS\" /> [[Alan Lomax]] went to [[Stovall, Mississippi]], on behalf of the Library of Congress to record various [[country blues]] musicians. \"He brought his stuff down and recorded me right in my house,\" Muddy told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, \"and when he played back the first song I sounded just like anybody's records. Man, you don't know how I felt that Saturday afternoon when I heard that voice and it was my own voice. Later on he sent me two copies of the pressing and a check for twenty bucks, and I carried that record up to the corner and put it on the jukebox. Just played it and played it and said, 'I can do it, I can do it'.\"<ref name=\"Palmer\" /> Lomax came back in July 1942 to record him again. Both sessions were eventually released by [[Testament Records (USA)|Testament Records]] as ''Down on Stovall's Plantation''.{{sfn|Gordon|2002|p=196}} The complete recordings were reissued by Chess Records on CD as ''Muddy Waters: The Complete Plantation Recordings. The Historic 1941\u201342 Library of Congress Field Recordings'' in 1993 and remastered in 1997.\n\nIn 1943, Waters headed to Chicago with the hope of becoming a full-time professional musician.  He later recalled arriving in Chicago as the single most momentous event in his life.{{sfn|Palmer|1982|p=13}} He lived with a relative for a short period while driving a truck and working in a factory by day and performing at night.{{sfn|Palmer|1982|p=14}} [[Big Bill Broonzy]], then one of the leading bluesmen in Chicago, had Muddy open his shows in the rowdy clubs where Broonzy played. This gave him the opportunity to play in front of a large audience.{{sfn|O'Neal|Van Singel|2002|pp=172\u2013173}} In 1944, he bought his first electric guitar and then formed his first electric combo. He felt obliged to electrify his sound in Chicago because, he said, \"When I went into the clubs, the first thing I wanted was an amplifier. Couldn't nobody hear you with an acoustic.\" His sound reflected the optimism of postwar African Americans. [[Willie Dixon]] said that \"There was quite a few people around singing the blues but most of them was singing all sad blues. Muddy was giving his blues a little pep.\" {{sfn|Szatmary|2014|p=8}}\n\nIn 1946, Muddy recorded some songs for [[Mayo Williams]] at [[Columbia Records]], with an old-fashioned combo consisting of clarinet, saxophone and piano; they were released a year later with Ivan Ballen's Philadelphia-based 20th Century label, billed as James \"Sweet Lucy\" Carter and his Orchestra \u2013 Muddy Waters' name was not mentioned on the label.<ref name=\"clemson\">{{cite web|title=Ebony, Chicago, Southern, and Harlem: The Mayo Williams Indies|url=http://campber.people.clemson.edu/ebony.html|access-date=June 25, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622191207/http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~campber/ebony.html|archive-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref> Later that year, he began recording for [[Aristocrat Records]], a newly formed label run by the brothers [[Leonard Chess|Leonard]] and [[Phil Chess]]. In 1947, he played guitar with [[Sunnyland Slim]] on piano on the cuts \"Gypsy Woman\" and \"Little Anna Mae\". These were also shelved, but in 1948, \"I Can't Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home\" became hits, and his popularity in clubs began to take off.{{sfn|Palmer|1982|pp=159\u2013160}} Soon after, Aristocrat changed its name to [[Chess Records]]. Muddy Waters's signature tune \"[[Rollin' Stone (Muddy Waters song)|Rollin' Stone]]\" also became a hit that year.\n\n=== Commercial success, 1948\u20131957 ===\nInitially, the Chess brothers would not allow Muddy Waters to use his working band in the recording studio;{{sfn|Palmer|1982|p=163}} instead, he was provided with a backing bass by [[Ernest \"Big\" Crawford]] or by musicians assembled specifically for the recording session, including [[\"Baby Face\" Leroy Foster]] and [[Little Johnny Jones (pianist)|Johnny Jones]]. Gradually, Chess relented, and by September 1953 he was recording with one of the most acclaimed blues groups in history: [[Little Walter Jacobs]] on harmonica, [[Jimmy Rogers]] on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums, and [[Otis Spann]] on piano.{{sfn|Palmer|1982|p=167}} The band recorded a series of blues classics during the early 1950s, some with the help of the bassist and songwriter [[Willie Dixon]], including \"[[Hoochie Coochie Man]]\", \"[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]\", and \"[[I'm Ready (Muddy Waters song)|I'm Ready]]\"\n\nMuddy Waters's band became a proving ground for some of the city's best blues talent,<ref name=\"allmusic-waters-bio\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/muddy-waters-mn0000608701/biography|title=Muddy Waters {{!}} Biography & History|author=Mark Deming|website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 2, 2019}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=April 2021}} with members of the ensemble going on to successful careers of their own. In 1952, Little Walter left when his single \"[[Juke (song)|Juke]]\" became a hit, although he continued a collaborative relationship long after he left, appearing on most of the band's classic recordings in the 1950s. [[Howlin' Wolf]] moved to Chicago in 1954 with financial support earned through his successful Chess singles, and the \"legendary rivalry\" with Muddy Waters began.

The album was a follow-up to the previous year's ''[[The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions]]''. Both albums were the brainchild of Chess Records producer Norman Dayron, and were intended to showcase Chicago blues musicians playing with the younger British rock musicians whom they had inspired. Muddy Waters brought with him two American musicians, harmonica player Carey Bell and guitarist [[Sammy Lawhorn]]. The British and Irish musicians who played on the album included [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Rick Grech]], and [[Mitch Mitchell]]. Muddy was dissatisfied by the results, due to the British musicians' more rock-oriented sound. \"These boys are top musicians, they can play with me, put the book before 'em and play it, you know,\" he told Guralnick. \"But that ain't what I need to sell my people, it ain't the Muddy Waters sound.

Jimi Hendrix recalled that \"I first heard him as a little boy and it scared me to death\". The band [[Cream (band)|Cream]] covered \"[[Rollin' and Tumblin']]\" on their 1966 debut album, ''[[Fresh Cream]]''. Eric Clapton was a big fan of Muddy Waters while growing up, and his music influenced Clapton's music career. \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\" was also covered by [[Canned Heat]] at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and later adapted by [[Bob Dylan]] on his album ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]''. One of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s biggest hits, \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\", has its lyrics heavily influenced by the Muddy Waters hit \"[[You Need Love (Muddy Waters song)|You Need Love]]\" (written by [[Willie Dixon]]). \"[[Hoochie Coochie Man]]\", was covered by [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]], [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Supertramp]] and [[Fear (band)|Fear]]. In 1993, [[Paul Rodgers]] released the album ''Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters'', on which he covered a number of his songs, including \"Louisiana Blues\", \"Rollin' Stone\", \"(I'm your) Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"I'm Ready\" in collaboration with guitarists such as [[Gary Moore]], [[Brian May]] and [[Jeff Beck]]. [[Angus Young]], of the rock group [[AC/DC]], has cited Muddy as one of his influences. The AC/DC song title \"[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]\" came from lyrics of the Muddy Waters song \"[[You Shook Me]]\", written by [[Willie Dixon]] and [[J. B. Lenoir]]. [[Earl Hooker]] first recorded it as an instrumental, which was then overdubbed with vocals by Muddy Waters in 1962. Led Zeppelin also covered it on their [[Led Zeppelin (album)|debut album]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1981 [[ZZ Top]] guitarist [[Billy Gibbons]] went to visit the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale with ''The Blues'' magazine founder Jim O'Neal. The museum's director, Sid Graves, brought Gibbons to visit Waters original house, and encouraged him to pick up a piece of scrap lumber that was originally part of the roof. Gibbons eventually converted the wood into a guitar. Named Muddywood, the instrument is now exhibited at the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://billygibbons.com/2017/06/bfg-muddy-waters/|title=BFG & Muddy Waters|website=Billygibbons.com|date=June 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his death, fellow blues musician [[B.B. King]] told ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine, \"It's going to be years and years before most people realize how greatly he contributed to American music.\" [[John P. Hammond]] told ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine, \"Muddy was a master of just the right notes. It was profound guitar playing, deep and simple ... more country blues transposed to the electric guitar, the kind of playing that enhanced the lyrics, gave profundity to the words themselves.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Muddy Waters funeral |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-waters16funeral-20150416-photo.html |website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>\n\nMuddy Waters' songs have been featured in long-time fan [[Martin Scorsese]]'s movies, including ''[[The Color of Money]]'', ''[[Goodfellas]]'', and ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''.
