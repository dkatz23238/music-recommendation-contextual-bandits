The band released their first EP, ''[[Translating the Name]]'' in 2003. That same year original vocalist [[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]] left Saosin due to personal reasons. In 2004, [[Cove Reber]] replaced Green as vocalist after auditioning for the role. With Reber the group recorded its [[Saosin (album)|self titled debut album]] which was released on [[Capitol Records]] on September 26, 2006. Their second studio album, ''[[In Search of Solid Ground]]'', was released on September 8, 2009 on [[Virgin Records]] and contains three re-recorded tracks from ''The Grey EP''. In 2010, Reber was dismissed from the band. In 2013, the band reformed with all original members, except Zach, and began touring. They released ''[[Along the Shadow]]'', their third studio album and first studio album with original vocalist Anthony Green, on May 20, 2016 through [[Epitaph Records]].\n\nSaosin emerged from the [[emo]] and [[post-hardcore]] scenes during the early 2000s, and has been regarded for their harmonizing vocals, lead guitar riffs with delays and natural harmonics as a form of creating melodies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thenewfury.com/the-vault-revisiting-saosins-debut-ep-translating-the-name/|title=The Vault: Why Saosin's debut EP, \"Translating The Name\", remains one of post-hardcore's finest|work=NewFuryMedia|date=October 9, 2015|access-date=May 16, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Origin of name==\n[[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]] had initially suggested the name \"Saosin\" for the band. Saosin means \"careful\" in Chinese (\u5c0f\u5fc3 xi\u01ceo x\u012bn). The word comes from a 15th-century [[proverb]] about fathers admonishing their sons who are being married off for money to not get emotionally involved with their wives, as they could die at any time. Green explained the meaning behind this as being a reference to the fact that nothing is eternal, and that it is a mistake to become overly attached to anyone or anything, because that thing will eventually be lost.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web|url=http://www.saosin.forumsunlimited.com/index.php?showtopic=12111|title=Saosin FAQ|access-date=August 27, 2006|author=Samantha Klingman|publisher=Saosin.com}}</ref> While Green's personal interpretation of the word \u5c0f\u5fc3 is obscure, \u5c0f\u5fc3 is generally used in Chinese as a means to express caution. Green had previously used \"Saosin\" as a track name in his high school band, Audience of One, ''I Remember When This All Meant Something''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p579297|pure_url=yes}}|title=Saosin biography|access-date=May 21, 2008|author=Corey Apar|publisher=Allmusic.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/3619|title=Audience of One; Anthony Green's high school band|publisher=Punknews.org|access-date=May 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''Translating the Name'' (2003\u20132004)===\nThe original lineup for Saosin, consisting of Burchell, [[Justin Shekoski|Shekoski]], Kennedy and Green, was formed in the summer of 2003.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} On June 17, the band released their first commercial production, the [[Extended Play|EP]] ''[[Translating the Name]]''.<ref name=\"emo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalpunk.com/cdreview/222/ |title=Saosin: ''Translating the Name'' |author=Andrew Martin |publisher=Emotionalpunk.com |access-date=May 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816194745/http://www.emotionalpunk.com/cdreview/222/ |archive-date=August 16, 2007 }}</ref> It was an immediate success and was immensely popular on online forums and music sites.\n\nSaosin first became popular through promotion and exposure through the [[Internet]]. They became known for their distinct musical styles long before their first studio-length album was released, and were popularized on social networking and music sites such as [[MySpace]]. The EP has sold an estimated 62,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/artists/showlink.php?do=showdetails&l=2426|title=Saosin -- band profile|access-date=May 21, 2008|publisher=Absolutepunk.com}}</ref>\n\nBassist Zach Kennedy left the band early on, as he wanted to pursue a career in art.<ref name=FAQ/> He was later replaced by [[Chris Sorenson]]. \nA local Southern Californian drummer by the name of Pat Magrath <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/thepatmagrath |title=Pat Magrath |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2016-01-19 |access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> was hired only for the recording for the EP, according to Burchell. The band was impressed with his drumming skills, however, and he later appeared as a guest performing Lost Symphonies live with the band. Alex Rodriguez was unable to record Translating the Name as he had promised his band at the time [[Open Hand]] he would finish recording with them. Danny King filled in for live drums with the band before Rodriguez completed his responsibilities with Open Hand and joined Saosin full-time after the EP release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nipp.com/artists/detail/saosin|title=Saosin Bio|publisher=Nipp.com|access-date=May 21, 2008}}</ref> Saosin went on a U.S. tour with bands [[Boys Night Out (band)|Boys Night Out]] and [[Anatomy of a Ghost]] shortly after the release of Translating the Name.\n\nIn February 2004, the band's vocalist [[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]] left Saosin and later formed the band [[Circa Survive]].

A public, nationwide audition then took place.\n\n''[[Translating the Name]]'' was viewed as \"expanding the limits\" of the post-hardcore genre and rewriting the music scene.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-10-10|title=The Vault: Why Saosin's debut EP, \"Translating The Name\", remains one of post-hardcore's finest|url=https://thenewfury.com/the-vault-revisiting-saosins-debut-ep-translating-the-name/|access-date=2021-05-09|website=New Fury Media|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] noted that with the release of the EP, Saosin stirred the underground and had many labels scurrying to sign them.<ref>{{Cite web|last=AltPress|date=2016-05-03|title=Taste Of Tuesday: In 2006, Saosin were tasked with surpassing their own accomplishments|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/taste_of_tueday_saosin_2006/|access-date=2021-05-09|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Arrival of Cove Reber and ''Saosin EP'' (2004\u20132006)===\nAfter the audition process and several guest vocalists on demos, the then 19-year-old [[Cove Reber]] was announced as their new permanent lead singer. Reber had sent in his demo tape, which was an acoustic demo with \"[[Mookie's Last Christmas]]\". The demo has since leaked onto the internet. It is widely speculated to have included a few songs from ''Translating the Name''. When Beau Burchell first heard the demo, he thought it was Anthony playing a trick on them, as Reber's vocal stylings were very similar to those of Green's when the demo was originally recorded.\n\nIn an interview with Euphonia Online, Reber commented that \"everyone I've played with wants to make music their lives...Saosin is a band on a completely different level. All these dudes are freaks about music.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Euphonia Online|url=https://www.euphoniaonline.net/interviews/CoveSaosin.html|work=New Singer Interview - Cove Reber (Saosin)|access-date=July 5, 2011}}</ref>\n\nReber's addition to the band was difficult, for the more experienced Green was the center piece of the band in the eyes of Saosin's fans. Many fans consider the time with Green to be something entirely different from the time with Reber. There are still distinct fans of both eras (Green Era/Reber Era) debating on which is a better fit for the band as a whole.{{cn|date=March 2016}}\n\nSaosin played the first [[Taste of Chaos]] tour the following winter with [[The Used]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Killswitch Engage]], [[Senses Fail]] and [[A Static Lullaby|Static Lullaby]].<ref>{{Cite web|title='Taste Of Chaos' Takes Shape|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65588/taste-of-chaos-takes-shape-|access-date=2021-05-09|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref> Saosin was signed to [[Capitol Records]] in March and toured the United States with the [[Warped Tour]] for the second time. That summer, they released the ''[[Saosin EP]]''. At first it was intended to be a free sampler, but Capitol Records would not allow this and released it as an EP. It contained demo versions of songs later recorded on their first full-length album. A video to their new single \"Bury Your Head\" was filmed during the tour. The band continued touring for the rest of 2005, opening for [[Avenged Sevenfold]] and [[Coheed and Cambria]].\n\n=== ''Saosin'' LP and ''Come Close'' (2006\u20132008) ===\nAfter a respite from touring between February and June, the [[Warped Tour 2006]] and numerous demos and compilation appearances, Saosin released their first full-length album ''[[Saosin (album)|Saosin]]'' on September 26, 2006. The well-known music producer [[Howard Benson]] was hired for the production of the album. Benson had worked with several major rock bands such as [[My Chemical Romance]] and [[Blindside (band)|Blindside]].

They also toured the United States with [[Bleeding Through]] and [[Senses Fail]]. They kept on touring for the whole year of 2007, beginning with a tour with [[Senses Fail]], [[Alexisonfire]], [[The Sleeping]] and [[Drop Dead, Gorgeous]]. Saosin also invited the non-profit organization [[Invisible Children]] for a portion of the tour. In February they joined the Taste of Chaos 2007 tour. Between April and June they toured in Europe, Australia, Japan and Indonesia.[[File:Saosin live on Projekt Revolution tour.jpg|thumb|280px|Saosin with [[Cove Reber]], live on [[Projekt Revolution]] Tour, in 2007]]When Saosin returned home they continued their headlining tour with [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]], [[The Receiving End of Sirens]], [[Fiore (music)|Fiore]] and [[Flight 409 (band)|Flight 409]].
