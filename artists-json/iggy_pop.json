Other influences on Pop's vocals and persona were [[Mick Jagger]] and [[James Brown]].\n\n{{blockquote|I attended two concerts by the Doors.

So, here's this guy, out of his head on [[lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]], dressed in leather with his hair all oiled and curled. The stage was tiny and it was really low. It got confrontational.

He's really pissing people off and he's lurching around making these guys angry.\" People were rushing the stage and Morrison's going \"Fuck you. You blank, blank, blank.\" You can fill in your sexual comments yourself. The other half of it was that I thought, \"If they've got a hit record out and they can get away with this, then I have no fucking excuse not to get out on stage with my band.\" It was sort of the case of, \"Hey, I can do that.\" There really was some of that in there.<ref>Wright, Jeb. [http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/show_interview.php?id=97 Irritatingly Interesting: An Interview with Iggy Pop\"] classicrockrevisited</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to Jim Morrison and The Doors' influence on the band, Pop also attributes the Stooges getting jump-started after seeing an all-girls rock band from [[Princeton, New Jersey]], called The Untouchable. In a 1995 interview with ''[[Bust (magazine)|Bust]]'', he relates:\n\n{{blockquote|And the other thing was we went to New York. We had gone to New York a couple of months before that just to check out the scene, and we had never been to a place like New York ... we went down around Eighth Street there where all the young tourists hang out, and we met these girls from New Jersey, from Princeton, they had a band called The Untouchable, and we're like, \"Oh, you've got a band, sure, ha ha ha,\" and they said \"Well, come to our house and see us play.\" And we didn't have anywhere to crash, and they played for us, and they completely rocked, and we were really ashamed.}}\n\nIn 1968, one year after their live debut and now dubbed [[the Psychedelic Stooges]], the band signed with [[Elektra Records]], again following in the footsteps of The Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (according to Pop, guitarist [[Ron Asheton]] called [[Moe Howard]] to see if it was all right to call the band \"The Stooges\", to which Howard responded by merely saying \"I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're not [[The Three Stooges|The ''Three'' Stooges]]!\" and hung up the phone). Pop himself told the story in the 2016 Jim Jarmusch documentary film about The Stooges, ''[[Gimme Danger]]''. The Stooges' first album ''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]'' (on which Pop was credited as \"Iggy Stooge\") was produced by [[John Cale]] in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'', produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of ''Fun House'' did not receive the recognition expected, it was later ranked No. 191 in ''Rolling Stone's'' '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-stooges-fun-house-20120524 \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time: The Stooges: ''Fun House''] ''Rolling Stone''.

With Williamson signed on as guitarist, the search began for a [[rhythm section]]. However, since neither Pop nor Williamson were satisfied with any players in England, they decided to re-unite the Stooges. Ron Asheton grudgingly moved from guitar to bass. The recording sessions produced the rock landmark ''[[Raw Power]]''. After its release, [[Scott Thurston]] was added to the band on keyboards/electric piano and Bowie continued his support, but Pop's [[drug abuse|drug problem]] persisted. The Stooges' last show in 1974 ended in a fight between the band and a group of [[motorcycling|bikers]], documented on the album ''[[Metallic K.O.]]'' Drug abuse stalled Pop's career again for several years.\n\n=== Bowie and Berlin: 1976\u20131978 ===\n[[File:Iggy-Pop 1977.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Iggy Pop on October 25, 1977, at the State Theatre in Minneapolis]]\n\nAfter the Stooges' second breakup, Pop made recordings with James Williamson, but these were not released until 1977 (as ''[[Kill City]]'', credited jointly to Pop and Williamson).<ref name=\"HodgkinsonPetridis\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/11/iggy-and-the-stooges-raw-power|title=The world was not ready for Iggy and the Stooges|last1=Hodgkinson|first1=Will|last2=Petridis|first2=Alexis|date=March 11, 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=February 16, 2018}}</ref> Pop was unable to control his [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and checked himself into a [[mental institution]], the [[UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute]], to try to clean up. Bowie was one of his few visitors there, continuing to support his friend and collaborator. In 1976, Bowie took Pop along as his companion on the ''[[Station to Station]]'' tour. This was Pop's first exposure to large-scale professional touring and he was impressed, particularly with Bowie's work ethic. Following a March 21, 1976, show, Bowie and Pop were arrested together for [[marijuana]] possession in [[Rochester, New York]], although charges were later dropped.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/rocroots/2016/01/11/david-bowie-rochester-arrest-march-1976/78619818/ |date=January 11, 2016 |title=When Rochester arrested David Bowie |author=<!--Not stated-->|newspaper=Rochester Democrat & Chronicle |access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBowie and Pop relocated to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions. \"Living in a Berlin apartment with Bowie and his friends was interesting\u2026\" Pop recalled. \"The big event of the week was Thursday night.

Bowie helped write and produce ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]'' and ''[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)|Lust for Life]],'' Pop's two most acclaimed albums as a solo artist, the latter featuring one of his best-known songs, \"[[The Passenger (song)|The Passenger]]\". ''[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)|Lust for Life]]'' featured another team of brothers, [[Hunt Sales|Hunt]] and [[Tony Fox Sales]], sons of comedian [[Soupy Sales]].

Bowie also played keyboards in Pop's live performances, some of which are featured on the album ''[[TV Eye Live 1977|TV Eye Live]]'' in 1978.

He moved to [[Arista Records]], under whose banner he released ''[[New Values]]'' in 1979. This album was something of a Stooges reunion, with James Williamson producing and latter-day Stooge [[Scott Thurston]] playing guitar and keyboards. Not surprisingly, the album's style harkened back to the guitar sound of the Stooges. ''New Values'' was not a commercial success in the U.S., but has since been highly regarded by critics.\n\nThe album was moderately successful in Australia and New Zealand, however, and this led to Pop's first visit there to promote it. While in Melbourne, he made a memorable appearance on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s nationwide show ''[[Countdown (music show)|Countdown]]''. During his anarchic performance of \"I'm Bored\", Pop made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was [[lip-synch]]ing (shoving the microphone down his pants at one point), and he even tried to grab the teenage girls in the audience. He was also interviewed by host [[Molly Meldrum]], an exchange which was frequently punctuated by the singer jumping up and down on his chair and making loud exclamations of \"G'day mate\" in a mock [[Australian accent]]. His ''Countdown'' appearance is generally considered one of the highlights of the show's history and it cemented his popularity with Australian punk fans; since then he has often toured there. While visiting New Zealand, Pop recorded a music video for \"I'm Bored\", and attended a record company function where he appeared to slap a woman and throw wine over a photographer.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Jane|last=Clifton|title=Iggy Pop Sets Tour Scene|magazine=The Dominion|date=July 16, 1979}}</ref> While in Australia, Pop was also the guest on a live late-night commercial TV interview show on the [[Ten Network]]. The ''Countdown'' appearance has often been re-screened in Australia.\n\nDuring the recording of ''[[Soldier (album)|Soldier]]'' (1980), Pop and Bowie argued with Williamson over various aspects of the project.

The book, which includes a selection of black and white photographs, featured a foreword by [[Andy Warhol]]. Warhol wrote that he met Pop when he was Jim Osterberg, at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1966. \"I don't know why he hasn't made it really big,\" Warhol wrote. \"He is so good.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=I Need More: The Stooges and Other Stories |last1=Pop |first1=Iggy |last2=Wehner |first2=Anne |chapter=Foreword by Andy Warhol |year=1982 |page=7 |publisher=Karz-Cohl Publishing |isbn=978-0-943828-50-3}}</ref>\n\nThe 1982 album ''[[Zombie Birdhouse]]'' on [[Chris Stein]]'s Animal label, with Stein himself producing, was no more commercially successful than his Arista works. In 1983, Pop's fortunes changed when David Bowie recorded a cover of the song \"China Girl\". The song had originally appeared on ''The Idiot'', and was a major hit on Bowie's blockbuster ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' album. As co-writer of the song, Pop received substantial [[royalties]]. On ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' in 1984, Bowie recorded five more of their co-written songs (2 from ''Lust for Life'', 1 from ''New Values'', and 2 new songs), assuring Pop financial security, at least for the short term. The support from Bowie enabled Pop to take a three-year break, during which he overcame his resurgent heroin addiction and took acting classes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hilburn |first1=Robert |title=IGGY POP'S BACK WITH A NEW IMAGE AND 'BLAHS' |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-30-ca-8466-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |date=October 30, 1986 |access-date=October 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Pop contributed the title song to the 1984 film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' (with [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], previously of the [[Sex Pistols]], on guitar, and [[Nigel Harrison]] and [[Clem Burke]], both of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] on bass and drums) as well as an instrumental called \"Repo Man Theme\" that was played during the opening credits.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iggy Pop Talks Repo Man |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2744-iggy-pop-talks-repo-man |website=Criterion |access-date=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Pop recorded some demos with Jones. He played these demos for Bowie, who was sufficiently impressed to offer to produce an album for Pop: 1986's [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced ''[[Blah-Blah-Blah (Iggy Pop album)|Blah-Blah-Blah]]'', featuring the single\n\"[[Wild One (Johnny O'Keefe song)|Real Wild Child]]\", a cover of \"The Wild One\", originally written and recorded by Australian rock 'n' roll musician [[Johnny O'Keefe]] in 1958. The single was a Top 10 hit in the UK and was successful around the world, especially in Australia, where it has been used since 1987 as the theme music for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s late-night music video show ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]''. ''Blah-Blah-Blah'' was Pop's highest-charting album in the U.S. since ''The Idiot'' in 1977, peaking at No. 75 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.\n\nAlso in 1985, Pop and [[Lou Reed]] contributed their singing voices to the animated film ''[[Rock & Rule]]''. Pop performed the song \"Pain & Suffering\" in the final sequence of the film.<ref>{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Casey |title=Rock & Rule |url=http://www.dvddrive-in.com/reviews/n-s/rockandrule83.htm |website=Dvddrive-in.com|access-date=July 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Pop appeared (along with [[Bootsy Collins]]) on a mostly instrumental album, ''[[Neo Geo (album)|Neo Geo]]'', by Japanese composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]. The music video for \"Risky\", written and directed by Meiert Avis, won the first ever MTV Breakthrough Video Award. {{Citation needed|date=March 2021|reason=No evidence provided on this page or Sakamoto's page}} The groundbreaking video explores [[wikt:transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[FM-2030]]'s ideas of ''Nostalgia for the Future'' in the form of an imagined love affair between a robot and one of [[Man Ray]]'s models in Paris in the late 1930s. Additional inspiration was drawn from [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Edvard Munch]]'s 1894 painting ''Puberty'', and [[Roland Barthes]] ''[[Death of the Author]]''. The surrealist black-and-white video uses stop motion, light painting, and other retro in-camera effects techniques. Meiert Avis recorded Sakamoto while at work on the score for ''The Last Emperor'' in London. Sakamoto also appears in the video painting words and messages to an open shutter camera. Pop, who performs the vocals on \"Risky\", chose not to appear in the video, allowing his performance space to be occupied by the surrealist era robot.\n\nPop's follow-up to ''Blah Blah Blah'', ''[[Instinct (Iggy Pop album)|Instinct]]'' (1988), was a turnaround in musical direction. Its stripped-back, guitar-based sound leaned further towards the sound of the Stooges than any of his solo albums to date. His record label dropped him, but the ''[[King Biscuit Flower Hour]]'' radio show recorded the ''Instinct'' tour (featuring guitarist [[Andy McCoy]] and [[Alvin Gibbs]] on bass) in Boston on July 19, 1988. Working with rock attorney Stann Findelle, Pop scored more movie soundtrack inclusions in 1989: \"Living on the Edge of the Night\" in the [[Ridley Scott]] thriller ''[[Black Rain (American film)|Black Rain]]''; and \"Love Transfusion\", a song originally written by [[Alice Cooper]] (who does backing vocals) and [[Desmond Child]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evenspot.com/html.folder/CDreview/AC_Soundtrack/Shocker.html |title=Alice Cooper Soundtracks |publisher=Evenspot.com |access-date=May 4, 2013}}</ref> in ''[[Wes Craven's Shocker]]''. Also, at the same time, Pop, dissatisfied from RCA's decisions, revoked copyrights of his RCA releases, assigned it to his company ''Thousand Mile'', and signed a contract with [[Virgin Records]], which was a unique hybrid of distribution deal for his RCA releases and a recording contract for new albums. Virgin first reissued ''Lust for Life'' and ''The Idiot'' in 1990, then ''TV Eye Live 1977'' in 1994. Virgin continues to distribute these albums to this day.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1990, Pop recorded ''[[Brick by Brick]]'', produced by [[Don Was]], with members of [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[The B-52's]] as guests, as well as backup vocals by many local Hollywood groups, two of whom ([[Whitey Kirst]] and [[Craig Pike]]) would create his band to tour and perform on his ''Kiss My Blood'' video (1991), directed by [[Tim Pope]] and filmed at the Olympia in Paris. The video attracted much controversy, as it featured much footage of Pop performing with his penis exposed to the audience. The album featured his first Top 40 U.S. hit, \"[[Candy (Iggy Pop song)|Candy]]\", a duet with B-52's singer [[Kate Pierson]].\n\nAlso in 1990, Pop sang the role of \"The Prosecutor\" for the [[POINT Music]]/[[Philips Records|Philips Classics]] recording (released in 1992) of composer [[John Moran (composer)|John Moran]]'s multimedia opera<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffel|first=Margaret Ross |title=Operas in English: A Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8bQAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|access-date=October 30, 2017|date=December 21, 2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8325-3|page=300|author-link= Margaret Ross Griffel}}</ref> ''The Manson Family''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/20-great-iggy-pop-collaborations-20160317/john-moran-the-manson-family-an-opera-1990-20160317|title=20 Great Iggy Pop Collaborations: John Moran, 'The Manson Family: An Opera' (1990)|last=Harris|first=Keith|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 17, 2016|access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/17/arts/will-the-manson-story-play-as-myth-operatically-at-that.html?pagewanted=all|title=Will the Manson Story Play As Myth, Operatically at That?|last=Kaznin|first=Allan|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 17, 1990|access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref> That year he also contributed to the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s AIDS benefit album [[Red Hot + Blue]] project, singing a version of \"[[Well Did You Evah!

He played James Mecklenberg, Nona Mecklenberg's father.\n\nIn 1991, Pop and Kirst contributed the song \"Why Was I Born (Freddy's Dead)\" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]''. The song also plays over the end credits of the film, with a compilation of clips from the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series running alongside the end credits. In the same year, Pop sang a leading role in the [[John Moran (composer)|John Moran]] opera ''The Manson Family''.\n\nIn 1992, he collaborated with [[Goran Bregovi\u0107]] on the [[Arizona Dream (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the movie ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' by [[Emir Kusturica]]. Pop sang four of the songs: ''In the Deathcar'', ''TV Screen'', ''Get the Money'', and ''This is a Film''. Also in 1992, he collaborated with the New York City band [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]. He recorded spoken word vocals on the intro and outro of the song \"[[Black Sunshine]]\" as well as playing the character of a writer in the video shot for the song. He is singled out for special thanks in the liner notes of the band's album ''[[La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume One]]''.\n\nIn 1993, Pop released ''[[American Caesar (album)|American Caesar]]'', including two successful singles, \"Wild America\" and \"Beside You\". The following year Pop contributed to [[Buckethead]]'s album ''[[Giant Robot (Buckethead album)|Giant Robot]]'', including the songs \"Buckethead's Toy Store\" and \"Post Office Buddy\". He appears also on the [[Les Rita Mitsouko]] album ''[[Syst\u00e8me D]]'' where he sings the duet \"My Love is Bad\" with [[Catherine Ringer]].\n\nIn 1996, Pop again found mainstream fame when his 1977 song \"[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]\" was featured in the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. A new video was recorded for the song, with clips from the film and studio footage of Pop dancing with one of the film's stars, [[Ewen Bremner]]. A Pop concert also served as a plot point in the film. The song has also been used in TV commercials for [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] and as the theme music to ''[[The Jim Rome Show]]'', a nationally syndicated American sports talk show.\n\nIn 1996, Pop released ''[[Naughty Little Doggie]]'', with Whitey Kirst returning on guitar, and the single \"I Wanna Live\". In 1997, he [[remix]]ed ''Raw Power'' to give it a rougher, more hard-edged sound; fans had complained for years that Bowie's official \"rescue effort\" mix was muddy and lacking in bass. Pop testified in the reissue's liner notes that on the new mix, \"everything's still in the red\". He co-produced his 1999 album ''[[Avenue B (album)|Avenue B]]'' with [[Don Was]], releasing the single \"Corruption\".\n\nIn 1997, Pop was credited with the soundtrack to the film ''[[The Brave (film)|The Brave]]''.{{sfn|Parrill|2009|page=191}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwpJFOSyEmEC&pg=PT358|title=Gimme Danger: The Story of Iggy Pop|first=Joe|last=Ambrose|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|location=London|year=2002|isbn=978-0711991071}}</ref>{{sfn|Pomerance|2005|page=286}}\n\nOn January 1, 1998, Pop made a guest appearance on [[Paramount Television (original)|Paramount Television]]'s science fiction series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.

The same year he appeared on Hashisheen, The End of Law, a collaborative effort by [[Bill Laswell]], reading on the tracks ''The Western Lands'' and ''A Quick Trip to Alamut''. He also sang on the tracks \"[[Rolodex Propaganda]]\" and \"Enfilade\" by [[At the Drive-In]] in 2000.\n\nFor New Year's Eve 1997, Pop was the headliner for the annual Australian three-day concert the Falls Festival. He gave one of the most memorable performances in the history of the festival. A member of the audience got to do the countdown for the new year with Pop as part of a competition to guess Pop's new year's resolution (it was \"To do nothing and make a lot of money!\")\n\n===The Stooges reunion: 2003\u20132010===\n[[File:Iggy Pop (5).jpg|thumb|The Stooges at Sziget Festival 2006]]\nPop's 2003 album ''[[Skull Ring]]'' featured collaborators [[Sum 41]], [[Green Day]], [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]], and [[The Trolls]], as well as Ron and Scott Asheton, reuniting the three surviving founding members of [[the Stooges]] for the first time since 1974. Pop made a guest appearance on [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]]'s song \"Kick It\" as well as the video. Also in 2003, his first full-length biography was published. ''Gimme Danger \u2013 The Story of Iggy Pop'' was written by Joe Ambrose; Pop did not collaborate on the biography or publicly endorse it. Having enjoyed working with the Ashetons on ''Skull Ring'', Pop reformed the Stooges with bassist [[Mike Watt]] (formerly of [[The Minutemen (band)|the Minutemen]]) filling in for the late [[Dave Alexander (musician)|Dave Alexander]], and ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'' saxophonist [[Steve Mackay]] rejoining the lineup. They have toured regularly since 2004. That year, Pop opened [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s ''Reinvention'' World Tour in Dublin.\n\nPop and the Stooges played the Glastonbury Festival in June 2007. Their set included material from the 2007 album ''The Weirdness'' and classics such as \"No Fun\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\". Pop also caused controversy in June 2007 when he was interviewed on the [[BBC]]'s coverage of the [[Glastonbury Festival]]. He used the phrase \"paki shop\", apparently unaware of its racist connotations, prompting three complaints and an apology from the BBC.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6238680.stm|title=BBC 'sorry' for Iggy racist word|work=BBC News|date=June 25, 2007|access-date=July 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn March 10, 2008, Pop appeared at [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf Astoria]] Hotel in New York. Together with the Stooges, he sang raucous versions of two Madonna hits, \"[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]\" and \"[[Ray of Light]]\". Before leaving the stage he looked directly at Madonna, quoting \"You make me feel shiny and new, like a virgin, touched for the very first time\", from Madonna's hit song \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\". According to guitarist Ron Asheton, Madonna asked the Stooges to perform in her place, as a protest to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for not inducting the Stooges, despite six appearances on the nomination ballot.<ref name=\"freep.com\">Brian McCollum {{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080310%2FENT04%2F80310062%2F&imw=Y |title=Why the Stooges performed for Madonna |access-date=April 9, 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314021804/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080310%2FENT04%2F80310062%2F&imw=Y |archive-date=March 14, 2008 }}. freep.com (March 10, 2008)</ref> Pop also sang on the \"No Fun\" cover by [[Asian Dub Foundation]] on their 2008 album ''[[Punkara]]''.\n\nOn January 6, 2009, original Stooges guitarist and Pop's self-described best friend [[Ron Asheton]] was found dead from an apparent heart attack.

He describes this new release as a \"quieter album with some jazz overtones\", the first single off the album, \"King of the Dogs\", bearing a sound strongly influenced by [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]] musicians such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Jelly Roll Morton]]. Pop said that the song was his response to being \"sick of listening to idiot thugs with guitars banging out crappy music\". The album is available on legal download sites, CD, and a deluxe box set is available at only 6000 units worldwide.
