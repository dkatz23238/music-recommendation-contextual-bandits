Marks works to cross genres, often using [[Arabic]] and Middle Eastern [[sampling (music)|samples]] against a bass heavy [[reggae]], rock, or [[trance music|trance]] rhythm to produce deeply textured tracks that progress layer upon layer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n==History==\nIn 1978, Marks began his musical career as a drummer in a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band.\n\nMarks moved to [[Portugal]] in 1986 and played [[The Beatles|Beatles]] music for tourists. He first delved into electronic music in 1989, when he bought a [[digital sampler]]. The first tune he recorded on it was called \"Maxwell House\".\n\nHaving cut his teeth on the early 1990s ambient dub compilations, in 1994 he released his first studio album ''Maya'' on [[Planet Dog]] records,<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=33}}</ref> which was submitted to the [[Mercury Music Prize]] on its release. It was followed in 1995 by the critically acclaimed ''[[Last Train to Lhasa]]''. Both albums reached No. 1 in the [[UK Indie Chart]] and featured in the Top 40 of the [[UK Albums Chart]]. In the following decade, Banco De Gaia released ''Live at Glastonbury'', ''Big Men Cry'', ''The Magical Sounds of Banco De Gaia'', ''Igizeh'' and ''You Are Here''.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Banco De Gaia put together a five-piece band that included Ted Duggan (drums), Ashley Hopkins (bass), Larry Whelan (wind synth, saxophone and ethnic flutes), and Gary Spacey-Foot (percussion and saxophones). The band reduced in number to just Marks, Duggan, and Hopkins in 1999, and then just Marks and Duggan from 2000 until 2003, when Marks went back to being a solo artist.\n\nOn 20 September 2009, Banco De Gaia played an album launch show for his album ''Memories Dreams Reflections'' at [[Dingwalls]] in London. This show was to celebrate 20 years of Banco De Gaia. Marks was joined on stage by three members from the original five-piece band: Hopkins, Whelan, and Duggan and vocalist Maya Preece, who sang on the latest album.\n\nHe released a studio album ''Apollo'' on 8 April 2013, on his own Disco Gecko Recordings.<ref>Parsons, Gary.
