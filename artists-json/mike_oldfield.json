Though primarily a guitarist, Oldfield plays a range of instruments, which includes keyboards, percussion, and vocals. He has adopted a range of musical styles throughout his career, including [[progressive rock]], [[World music|world]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], and [[new age music]].\n\nOldfield took up the guitar at age ten and left school in his teens to embark on a music career. From 1967 to 1970, he and his sister [[Sally Oldfield]] were a folk duo [[The Sallyangie]], after which he performed with [[Kevin Ayers]]. In 1971, Oldfield started work on ''Tubular Bells'' which caught the attention of [[Richard Branson]], who agreed to release it on his new label, [[Virgin Records]]. Its opening was used in the horror film ''[[The Exorcist]]'' and the album went on to sell over 2.7 million copies in the UK. Oldfield followed it with ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974), ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975), and ''[[Incantations (album)|Incantations]]'' (1978), all of which feature longform and mostly instrumental pieces.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Oldfield began to tour and release more commercial and song-based music, beginning with ''[[Platinum (Mike Oldfield album)|Platinum]]'' (1979), ''[[QE2 (album)|QE2]]'' (1980), and ''[[Five Miles Out]]'' (1982). His most successful album of this period was ''[[Crises (Mike Oldfield album)|Crises]]'' (1983), which features the worldwide hit single \"[[Moonlight Shadow]]\" with vocalist [[Maggie Reilly]]. After signing with [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] in the early 1990s, Oldfield's most significant album of the decade was ''[[Tubular Bells II]]'' (1992) and he experimented with virtual reality and gaming content with his [[MusicVR]] project. In 2012, he performed at the opening ceremony for the [[2012 Olympic Games]] held in London. [[Mike Oldfield discography|Oldfield's discography]] includes 26 studio albums, nine of which have reached the UK top-ten. His most recent album is ''[[Return to Ommadawn]]'' (2017).\n\n==Early life==\nOldfield was born on 15 May 1953 in [[Reading, Berkshire]], to Raymond Oldfield, a [[general practitioner]], and Maureen (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Liston), an Irish woman.<ref name=\"omnotes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amarok.ommadawn.net/mike/discog/extras/ommadawnnotes.htm |title=Ommadawn |website=amarok.ommadawn.net |first=Rob |last=Miles |access-date=11 July 2008}}</ref><ref name=HAE02>{{cite web |url=https://tubular.net/articles/2002_08d/Interview-with-Mike-Oldfield-from-BBC-1s-Heaven-and-Hearth |title=Interview with Mike Oldfield from BBC 1's Heaven and Hearth |work=Heaven and Earth |via=Tubular.net |first=Alice |last=Beer |date=25 August 2002 |access-date=12 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |section=Oldfield Mike |section-url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195313734.013.20694 |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |first=Colin |last=Larkin |author-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |edition=4th |date=2006 |isbn=9780199726363}}</ref> He has two elder siblings, sister [[Sally Oldfield|Sally]] and brother [[Terry Oldfield|Terence]].{{sfn|Dewey|2013|p=8}} When Oldfield was seven, his mother gave birth to a younger brother, David, who had [[Down syndrome]] and died in infancy.

Attempts to secure a recording deal to record it professionally came to nothing. In September 1971, Oldfield, now a session musician and bassist for the [[Arthur Louis|Arthur Louis Band]], attended recording sessions at [[The Manor Studio]] near [[Kidlington]], [[Oxfordshire]], owned by businessman [[Richard Branson]] and run by engineers [[Tom Newman (musician)|Tom Newman]] and Simon Heyworth.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> Branson already had several business ventures and was about to launch [[Virgin Records]] with Simon Draper. Newman and Heyworth heard some of Oldfield's demos and took them to Branson and Draper, who eventually gave Oldfield one week of recording time at The Manor, after which Oldfield had completed what became \"Part One\" of his composition, ''[[Tubular Bells]]''.

Oldfield played more than twenty different instruments in the [[Overdubbing|multi-layered recording]], and its style moved through diverse musical genres. Its 2,630,000 UK sales puts it at No.&nbsp;34 on the list of the best-selling albums in the country. The title track became a top 10 hit single in the US after the opening was used in the film ''[[The Exorcist]]'' in 1973. It is today considered to be a forerunner of the [[New-age music|new-age music movement]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Patti Jean |last=Birosik |title=The New Age Music Guide |year=1989 |publisher=Collier MacMillan |page=138 |isbn=0-02-041640-7}}</ref>\n\n====''Hergest Ridge'' to ''Incantations''====\nIn 1974, Oldfield played the guitar on the critically acclaimed album ''[[Rock Bottom (album)|Rock Bottom]]'' by [[Robert Wyatt]].\n\nIn late 1974, his follow-up LP, ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'', was No.&nbsp;1 in the UK for three weeks before being dethroned by ''Tubular Bells''. Although ''Hergest Ridge'' was released over a year after ''Tubular Bells'', it reached No.&nbsp;1 first. ''Tubular Bells'' spent 11 weeks (10 of them consecutive) at No.&nbsp;2 before its one week at the top. Like ''Tubular Bells'', ''Hergest Ridge'' is a two-movement instrumental piece, this time evoking scenes from Oldfield's [[Herefordshire]] country retreat. It was followed in 1975 by the pioneering [[world music]] piece ''[[Ommadawn]]'' released after the death of his mother, Maureen.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amadian.net/biography1.htm |title=''Amadian - The Mike Oldfield Biography (II)'' website |access-date=26 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Oldfield recorded a version of the Christmas piece \"[[In Dulci Jubilo (Mike Oldfield)|In Dulci Jubilo]]\" which charted at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK.\n\nIn 1975, Oldfield received a [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition|Grammy award for Best Instrumental Composition]] in \"Tubular Bells \u2013 Theme from ''The Exorcist''\".\n\nIn 1976, Oldfield and his sister joined his friend and band member [[Pekka Pohjola]] to play on his album ''[[Mathematician's Air Display]]'', which was released in 1977. The album was recorded and edited at Oldfield's Througham Slad Manor in [[Gloucestershire]] by Oldfield and Paul Lindsay. Oldfield's 1976 rendition of \"[[Portsmouth (Mike Oldfield single)|Portsmouth]]\" remains his best-performing single on the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching No.&nbsp;3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com|title=Mike Oldfield \u2013 \"Portsmouth\"|publisher=EveryHit|access-date=8 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nOldfield recorded the double album ''[[Incantations (album)|Incantations]]'' between December 1977 and September 1978. This introduced more diverse choral performances from [[Sally Oldfield]], [[Maddy Prior]], and the [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] Girls Choir. When it was released on 1 December 1978, the album went to No. 14 in the UK and reached platinum certification for 300,000 copies sold.\n\nIn June 1978, during the recording of ''Incantations'', Oldfield and his siblings completed a three-day [[Exegesis (group)|Exegesis]] seminar, a controversial self-assertiveness programme based on [[Werner Erhard]]'s [[Erhard Seminars Training|EST training programme]]. The experience had a significant effect on Oldfield's personality, who recalled that he underwent a \"rebirth experience\" by reliving past fears. \"It was like opening some huge cathedral doors and facing the monster, and I saw that the monster was myself as a newborn infant, because I'd started life in a panic.\"<ref name=G97/><ref name=MM78>{{cite news|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/mike-oldfield-this-is-the-year-of-the-expanding-man|title=Mike Oldfield: This is the Year of the Expanding Man...|first=Karl|last=Dallas|newspaper=Melody Maker|date=25 November 1978|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|url-access=subscription |access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref> Following the Exegesis seminar, the formerly reclusive Oldfield granted press interviews, posed nude for a promotional photo shoot for ''Incantations'', and went drinking with news reporters.

The tour was documented with the live album and concert film, ''[[Exposed (Mike Oldfield album)|Exposed]]''. Initially marketed as a limited pressing of 100,000 copies, the strength of sales for the album were strong enough for Virgin to abandon the idea shortly after, transferring it to regular production.<ref name=G97/> During the tour Oldfield released the disco-influenced non-album single \"[[Guilty (Mike Oldfield instrumental)|Guilty]]\", for which he went to New York City to find the best session musicians and write a song with them in mind. He wrote a chord chart for the song and presented it to the group, who completed it in the studio.<ref name=TS12/> Released in April 1979, the song went to No. 22 in the UK and Oldfield performed the song on the national television show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.\n\nOldfield's music was used for the score of ''[[The Space Movie]]'' (1980), a [[Virgin Films]] production that celebrated the tenth anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] mission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mikeoldfieldspacemoviedvd.com/|title=''The Space Movie'' website|access-date=25 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517093522/http://mikeoldfieldspacemoviedvd.com/|archive-date=17 May 2010}}</ref> In 1979, he recorded a version of [[Blue Peter (instrumental)|the signature tune]] for the BBC children's television programme ''[[Blue Peter]]'', which was used by the show for 10 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newtalent/under_16/showcase_bp.shtml |title=Blue Peter's theme tune |publisher=BBC New Talent |date=April 2007 |access-date=20 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n====''Platinum'' to ''Heaven's Open''====\nOldfield's fifth album, ''[[Platinum (Mike Oldfield album)|Platinum]]'', was released in November 1979 and marked the start of his transition from long compositions towards mainstream and pop music. Oldfield performed across Europe between April and December 1980 with the [[In Concert 1980]] tour.\n\nIn 1980, Oldfield released ''[[QE2 (album)|QE2]]'', named after the [[Queen Elizabeth 2|ocean liner]], which features a variety of guest musicians including [[Phil Collins]] on drums. This was followed by the European Adventure Tour 1981, during which Oldfield accepted an invitation to perform at a free concert celebrating the [[Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer|wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana]] in [[Guildhall]]. He wrote a new track, \"Royal Wedding Anthem\", for the occasion.<ref name=G97/>\n\nHis next album, ''[[Five Miles Out]]'', followed in March 1982, with the 24-minute track \"Taurus II\" occupying the whole of side one. The Five Miles Out World Tour 1982 saw Oldfield perform from April to December of that year. ''[[Crises (Mike Oldfield album)|Crises]]'' saw Oldfield continue the pattern of one long composition with shorter songs. The first single from the album, \"[[Moonlight Shadow]]\", with [[Maggie Reilly]] on vocals, became Oldfield's most successful single, reaching No. 4 in the UK<ref name=G97/> and No. 1 in nine other countries. The subsequent Crises Tour in 1983 concluded with a concert at [[Wembley Arena]] to commemorate the tenth anniversary of ''Tubular Bells''. The next album, ''[[Discovery (Mike Oldfield album)|Discovery]]'', continues with this trend, being the first single \"[[To France]]\" and subsequent Discovery Tour 1984.\n\nOldfield later turned to film and video, writing [[The Killing Fields (album)|the score]] for [[Roland Joff\u00e9]]'s acclaimed film ''[[The Killing Fields (movie)|The Killing Fields]]'' and producing substantial video footage for his album ''[[Islands (Mike Oldfield album)|Islands]]''. ''Islands'' continued what Oldfield had been doing on the past couple of albums, with an instrumental piece on one side and rock/pop singles on the other. Of these, \"[[Islands (Mike Oldfield song)|Islands]]\", sung by [[Bonnie Tyler]] and \"[[Magic Touch (Mike Oldfield song)|Magic Touch]]\", with vocals by [[Max Bacon]] (in the US version) and [[Glasgow]] vocalist Jim Price (Southside Jimmy) in the rest of the world,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southsidejimmy.co.uk/site/pages/biog.htm |title=Southside Jimmy Biography |publisher=Southside Jimmy |access-date=2 November 2008}}</ref> were the major hits.

During the 1980s, Oldfield's then-wife, Norwegian singer [[Anita Hegerland]], contributed vocals to many songs including \"[[Pictures in the Dark]]\".\n\nReleased in July 1989, ''[[Earth Moving]]'' features seven vocalists across the album's nine tracks.<ref name=G97/> It is Oldfield's first to consist solely of rock and pop songs, several of which were released as singles: \"[[Innocent (Mike Oldfield song)|Innocent]]\" and \"[[(One Glance Is) Holy|Holy]]\" in Europe, and \"Hostage\" in the US.\n\nFor his next instrumental album, Virgin insisted that Oldfield use the title ''Tubular Bells 2''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-05-20|title=How we made: Richard Branson and Mike Oldfield on Tubular Bells|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/20/how-we-made-tubular-bells|access-date=2021-10-12|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Oldfield's rebellious response was ''[[Amarok (Mike Oldfield album)|Amarok]]'', an hour-long work featuring rapidly changing themes, unpredictable bursts of noise and a hidden [[Morse code]] insult, stating \"Fuck off RB\", allegedly directed at [[Richard Branson|Branson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/20/mike-oldfield-interview-tubular-bells-drugs |title=Mike Oldfield: 'We wouldn't have had Tubular Bells without drugs' |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 March 2014 |access-date=2 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/faq/ |title=FAQ |publisher=Tubular.net |access-date=26 October 2013}}</ref> Oldfield did everything in his power to make it impossible to make extracts and Virgin returned the favour by barely promoting the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mikeoldfield.org/amarok |title=Amarok |publisher=Dark Star Magazine |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nin February 1991, Oldfield released his final album for Virgin, ''[[Heaven's Open]]'', under the name \"Michael Oldfield\".

The band's popularity grew after Oldfield covered their song \"O son do ar\" (\"The sound of the air\") on his ''Voyager'' album.\n\nIn 1998, Oldfield produced [[Tubular Bells III|the third ''Tubular Bells'' album]] (also premiered at a [[Tubular Bells III Live|concert]], this time in [[Horse Guards Parade]], London), drawing on the [[dance music]] scene at his then new home on the island of [[Ibiza]]. This album was inspired by themes from ''Tubular Bells'', but differed in lacking a clear two-part structure.\n\nDuring 1999, Oldfield released two albums. The first, ''[[Guitars (Mike Oldfield album)|Guitars]]'', used guitars as the source for all the sounds on the album, including percussion. The second, ''[[The Millennium Bell]]'', consisted of [[pastiche]]s of a number of styles of music that represented various historical periods over the past millennium. The work was [[The Art in Heaven Concert|performed live]] in Berlin for the city's millennium celebrations in 1999\u20132000.\n\nHe added to his repertoire the [[MusicVR]] project, combining his music with a [[virtual reality]]-based computer game. His first work on this project is ''[[Tr3s Lunas]]'' launched in 2002, a virtual game where the player can interact with a world full of new music. This project appeared as a double CD, one with the music, and the other with the [[Tres Lunas (video game)|game]].\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, Oldfield re-recorded ''Tubular Bells'' using modern equipment to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the original. He had wanted to do it years before but his contract with Virgin kept him from doing so.<ref name=SOS02>{{cite web|url=https://tubular.net/articles/2002_11/Mike-Oldfield-Sound-on-Sound|title=Mike Oldfield - Sound on Sound|date=November 2002|first=Mark|last=Wherry|work=Sound on Sound|access-date=22 September 2019}}</ref> This new version features [[John Cleese]] as the Master of Ceremonies as [[Viv Stanshall]], who spoke on the original, died in the interim. ''[[Tubular Bells 2003]]'' was released in May 2003.\n\n===2004\u2013present: Mercury years===\nOn 12 April 2004 Oldfield launched his next [[virtual reality]] project, ''[[Maestro (video game)|Maestro]]'', which contains music from the ''Tubular Bells 2003'' album and some new [[chillout]] melodies. The games have since been made available free of charge on Tubular.net.<ref name=\"tubulararchives\"/>\n\nIn 2005, Oldfield signed a deal with [[Mercury Records|Mercury Records UK]], who secured the rights to his catalogue when the rights had reverted to himself. Mercury acquired the rights to Oldfield's back catalogue, in July 2007. Oldfield released his first album on the Mercury label, ''[[Light + Shade]]'', in September 2005. It is a double album of music of contrasting mood: relaxed (Light) and upbeat and moody (Shade). In 2006 and 2007, Oldfield headlined the [[Night of the Proms]] tour, consisting of 21 concerts across Europe.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.notp.com/?country=de&menuitem=2 | title=Nokia Night of the Proms 2006 |publisher=[[Night of the Proms]] |access-date=1 June 2006}}</ref> Also in 2007, Oldfield released his autobiography, ''[[Changeling (Mike Oldfield autobiography)|Changeling]]''.<ref name=resolution>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/2007_03 |title=Craft: Mike Oldfield |work=Resolution Magazine |date=March 2007 |access-date=2 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2008 Oldfield released his first classical album, ''[[Music of the Spheres (Mike Oldfield album)|Music of the Spheres]]''; [[Karl Jenkins]] assisted with the orchestration.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicsandjazz.co.uk/tssite/homepage.do?ruleset=artist&id=51402037 |title=Mike Oldfield artist details |publisher=[[Universal Classics and Jazz]] |access-date=2 April 2008}}</ref> In the first week of release the album topped the [[UK Classical chart]] and reached No. 9 on the main UK Album Chart.

He has, however, regularly returned to projects emphasising detailed, manually played and part-acoustic instrumentation (such as 1990's ''Amarok'', 1996's ''Voyager'' and 1999's ''Guitars'').\n\nWhile generally preferring the sound of guest vocalists, Oldfield has frequently sung both lead and backup parts for his songs and compositions. He has also contributed experimental vocal effects such as fake choirs and the notorious \"Piltdown Man\" impression on ''Tubular Bells''.\n\n===Guitars===\nOver the years, Oldfield has used a range of guitars.
