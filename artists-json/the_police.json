The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Emerging in the British [[New wave music|new wave]] scene, they played a style of rock influenced by [[punk rock|punk]], [[reggae]], and [[jazz]].\n\nTheir 1978 debut album, ''[[Outlandos d'Amour]]'', reached No. 6 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] on the strength of the singles \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\" and \"[[Can't Stand Losing You]]\". Their second album, ''[[Reggatta de Blanc]]'' (1979), became the first of four consecutive No. 1 studio albums in the UK and Australia; its first two singles, \"[[Message in a Bottle (The Police song)|Message in a Bottle]]\" and \"[[Walking on the Moon]]\", became their first UK number ones. Their next two albums, ''[[Zenyatta Mondatta]]'' (1980) and ''[[Ghost in the Machine (album)|Ghost in the Machine]]'' (1981), led to further critical and commercial success with two songs, \"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\" and \"[[Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic]]\", becoming UK number-one singles and Top 5 hits in other countries; the former album was their breakthrough into the US reaching number five on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nTheir final studio album, ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' (1983), was No. 1 in the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy and the US, selling over 8&nbsp;million copies in the US. Its lead single, \"[[Every Breath You Take]]\", became their fifth UK number one, and only US number one. During this time, the band were considered one of the leaders of the [[Second British Invasion]] of the US; in 1983 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' labelled them \"the first British New Wave act to break through in America on a grand scale, and possibly the biggest band in the world.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Anglomania: The Second British Invasion|magazine=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/anglomania-the-second-british-invasion-52016/|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-date=30 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430072719/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/anglomania-the-second-british-invasion-52016/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/books/i-want-my-mtv-by-craig-marks-and-rob-tannenbaum-review.html?_r=0 \"When Video Killed Radio Stars\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317203511/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/books/i-want-my-mtv-by-craig-marks-and-rob-tannenbaum-review.html?_r=0 |date=17 March 2017 }}.

The drummer Howlett had in mind, [[Chris Cutler]], was unavailable, so Sting took Copeland. The band's fourth member was guitarist [[Andy Summers]]. A decade older than Sting and Copeland, Summers was a music industry veteran who had played with [[Eric Burdon and the Animals]] and [[Kevin Ayers]] among others. Strontium 90 performed at a Gong reunion concert in Paris on 28 May 1977, and played at a London club (under the name of \"the Elevators\") in July.<ref>{{harvnb|Summers|2006|pp=167\u2013170}}</ref> The band also recorded several demo tracks: these were released (along with live recordings and an early version of \"[[Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic]]\") 20 years later on the archive album ''[[Strontium 90: Police Academy]]''.\n\n{{Quote box|width=31%|align=left|quote=\"I thought there was fantastic potential in Sting and Stewart.

Shortly after the Strontium 90 gig, Sting approached Summers to join the band. He agreed, on the condition the band remain a trio, with him replacing Padovani. Restrained by loyalty, Copeland and Sting resisted the idea, and The Police carried on as a four-piece version. However, they only performed live twice: on 25 July 1977 at the [[KOKO (music venue)|Music Machine]] in London and on 5 August at the [[Mont de Marsan]] Punk Festival. Shortly after these two gigs (and an aborted recording session with ex-[[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] member [[John Cale]] as producer on 10 August), Summers delivered an ultimatum to the band and [[Henry Padovani|Padovani]] was dismissed leaving him free to join Wayne County & The Electric Chairs. The effect of Summers's arrival was instant: Copeland said: \"One by one, Sting's songs had started coming in, and when Andy joined, it opened up new numbers of Sting's we could do, so the material started to get a lot more interesting and Sting started to take a lot more interest in the group.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\"/>\n\nThe Police's [[power trio]] line-up of Copeland, Sting, and Summers performed for the first time on 18 August 1977 at Rebecca's club in [[Birmingham]] in the West Midlands.<ref>[[Christopher Sandford (biographer)|Christopher Sandford]] (2007). \"Sting: Back on the Beat\". p. 53.

In late 1977 and early 1978, Sting and Summers recorded and performed as part of an ensemble led by German experimental composer [[Eberhard Schoener]]; Copeland also joined for a time. These performances resulted in three albums, each of them an eclectic mix of rock, [[electronica]] and jazz.<ref>\"Trance-Formation\" (EMI 1C 064-32 526) with Andy Summers (1977); \"Flashback\" (EMI 1C 066-32 839) with Sting, Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland (1978); \"Video-Magic\" (EMI 1C 064-45 234) with Sting and Andy Summers (1978).</ref> Various appearances by the Schoener outfit on German television made the German public aware of Sting's unusual high-pitched voice, and helped pave the way for The Police's later popularity.\n\nThe [[Blond#bleached blond|bleached-blond]] hair that became a band trademark happened by accident. In February 1978, the band, desperate for money, was asked to do a commercial for [[Wrigley's Spearmint]] [[chewing gum]] (directed by [[Tony Scott]]) on the condition they dye their hair blond.<ref>Obrecht, Jan. \"Andy Summers\". {{harvnb|Menn|1992|p=246}}</ref> The commercial was shot with the band, but was shelved and never aired.<ref>{{harvnb|Campion|2009|pp=59}}</ref>\n\n===1977\u20131978: Recording contract and ''Outlandos d'Amour''===\nCopeland's older brother [[Miles Copeland III|Miles]] was initially sceptical of the inclusion of Summers in the band, fearing it would undermine their punk credibility, and reluctantly agreed to provide \u00a31,500 to finance The Police's first album. Recording ''[[Outlandos d'Amour]]'' was difficult, as the band was working on a small budget, with no manager or record deal. It was recorded during off-peak hours at the [[Nigel Gray#Surrey Sound Studios (1975\u20131987)|Surrey Sound Studios]] in [[Leatherhead]], Surrey, a converted recording facility above a dairy which was run by brothers Chris and [[Nigel Gray]].<ref>Chris Campion (2010). \"Walking on the Moon: The Untold Story of The Police and the Rise of New Wave Rock\". p. 229. John Wiley and Sons</ref>\n\nDuring one of his periodic studio visits, Miles heard \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\" for the first time at the end of a session. Where he had been less enthusiastic about the band's other songs, the elder Copeland was immediately struck by the track, and quickly got The Police a record deal with [[A&M Records]] on the strength of it.<ref>{{harvnb|Summers|2006|p=194}}</ref> \"Roxanne\" was issued as a single in the spring of 1978, while other album tracks were still being recorded, but it failed to chart.

Retrieved 5 December 2011</ref> After the [[Ghost in the Machine Tour]] concluded in 1982, the group took a sabbatical and each member pursued outside projects. By this time, Sting was becoming a major star, and he established a career beyond the Police by branching out into acting. Back in 1979, he had made a well-received debut as the \"Ace Face\" in the British drama film ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'', a film loosely based on [[The Who]]'s [[Quadrophenia|rock opera]], followed by a role as a mechanic in love with [[Eddie Cochran]]'s music in [[Chris Petit]]'s ''[[Radio On]]''. In 1982, Sting furthered his acting career by co-starring in the [[Richard Loncraine]] film ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]''. He also had a minor solo hit in the United Kingdom with the movie's theme song, a cover of the 1929 hit \"[[Spread a Little Happiness]]\" (which appeared on the [[Brimstone & Treacle (soundtrack)|''Brimstone & Treacle'' soundtrack]], along with three new Police tracks, \"How Stupid Mr Bates\", \"A Kind of Loving\", and \"I Burn for You\"). Over 1981 and 1982, Summers recorded his first album with [[Robert Fripp]], ''[[I Advance Masked]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Stewart Copeland composed the musical score for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[Rumble Fish#Soundtrack|Rumble Fish]]''. The single \"[[Don't Box Me In]] (theme From ''Rumble Fish'')\", a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter [[Stan Ridgway]] (of the band [[Wall of Voodoo]]) received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. Also in 1983, Sting filmed his first big-budget movie role-playing [[Feyd-Rautha]] in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''. As Sting's fame rose, his relationship with Stewart Copeland deteriorated. Their increasingly strained partnership was further stretched by the pressures of worldwide publicity and fame, conflicting egos, and their financial success.
