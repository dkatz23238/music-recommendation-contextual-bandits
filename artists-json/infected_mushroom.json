The duo then renamed themselves Infected Mushroom, a name they stole from a local punk band that had been disbanded. The young duo drew inspiration from [[The Prodigy]] and [[Metallica]].

Empire'' is notable for the musical epic \"Dancing with Kadafi\", which segues numerous styles of music, most notably through middle-eastern style melodies and a classical break which showcases Erez and Amit's piano skills. The name \"Dancing with Kadafi\" may be a reference to Erez's cat, who was named Kadafi.\n\n''Converting Vegetarians'' (2003), was a two-disc set. The 'Trance Side' disc contained trance-like dancefloor material comparable to their earlier work, while the disc entitled 'The Other Side' contained genre-bending experimental music. 'The Other Side' included Duvdev's vocal debut on the title track, the down-tempo \"Elation Station\", and the electro-pop tracks \"Blink\" and \"Illuminaughty\".\n\n=== 2004\u20132007: ''IM the Supervisor'' and increasing popularity ===\nThe 2004 release of ''IM The Supervisor'', continued to mix [[psytrance]] with other musical genres and became Infected Mushroom's best-selling album to date.
