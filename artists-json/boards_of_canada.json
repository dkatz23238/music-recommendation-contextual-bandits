They experimented with recording techniques from around the age of 10, using [[tape recorder|tape machine]]s to layer cut-up [[sampling (music)|samples]] of found sounds over compositions of their own.<ref name=pitchfork/> In their teens they participated in a number of amateur bands. However, it was not until 1986 when Marcus was invited to join Mike's band that Boards of Canada was born. The band's name was inspired by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), the government agency whose award winning documentary films and animation they had watched as children.<ref name=pitchfork/> By 1989, the band had been reduced to Mike and Marcus. In the early 1990s, a number of collaborations took place and the band put on small shows among the [[Hexagon Sun]] collective.\n\n===''Music Has the Right to Children'' (1995\u20132002)===\nIn 1995, the band made their first Hexagon Sun studio release, the EP ''[[Twoism]]''. Like earlier [[Music70]] releases, it was produced in a self-financed limited run and was privately distributed, primarily to friends and labels. Unlike previous releases, however, a small number of copies were also released to the public through a mailing list. Though not a widespread commercial release, it was considered of sufficient quality and worth to be subsequently re-pressed in 2002.\n\nThe band made another release in 1996; titled ''[[Boc Maxima]]'', it was a semi-private release that was notable for being a full-length album, and was the precursor to ''[[Music Has the Right to Children]]'', with which it shares many tracks.\n\nBoards of Canada's first commercial release occurred after attracting the attention of [[Autechre]]'s [[Sean Booth]], of the English label [[Skam Records]], one of many people who were sent a demo EP. Skam issued what was considered Boards of Canada's first \"findable\" work, ''[[Hi Scores]]'', in 1996.\n\nThe debut studio album, ''[[Music Has the Right to Children]]'', was released in April 1998. The album consists of longer tracks mixed with song vignettes. It also includes one of the duo's most popular songs, \"Roygbiv\". ''Music Has the Right to Children'' received widespread acclaim upon release. It featured at No. 35 on [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'s \"Top 100 Albums of the 1990s\" list.<ref>{{citation |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5923-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/7/ |title=Staff Lists: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s \u2013 Features \u2013 Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork.com|access-date=15 June 2013}}</ref> It was ranked No. 91 in [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'s 100 Modern Classics list.\n\n[[John Peel]] featured Boards of Canada on his [[BBC Radio 1]] programme in July of that year. The session featured two remixes from ''[[Music Has the Right to Children]]'' \u2014 \"Aquarius (Version 3)\" and \"Olson (Version 3)\" \u2014 along with the tracks \"Happy Cycling\" and \"XYZ\". \"XYZ\" was excluded from the ''[[Peel Session TX 21/07/1998]]'' release until 2019.\n\nThough never an actively touring band, Boards of Canada did perform a handful of shows. Early shows saw them supporting Warp labelmates [[Seefeel]] and [[Autechre]] in a handful of UK dates. They also participated in a few festivals and multi-artist bills including two Warp parties: [[Live @ Warp10|Warp's 10th Anniversary Party]] in 1999 and The Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party almost one year later. They made their most prominent showing in 2001 as one of the headliners at the [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]]-curated [[Live @ ATP|All Tomorrow's Parties]]. They have not performed a live show since.\n\nThe band released a four-track EP, ''[[In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country]]'', in November 2000, their first original release in two years. The 12\" edition was pressed on [[sky blue]] vinyl.\n\n===''Geogaddi'' and ''The Campfire Headphase'' (2002\u20132009)===\nTheir second studio album, ''[[Geogaddi]]'', was released in February 2002. Like ''[[Music Has the Right to Children]]'', this album consists of longer tracks mixed with song vignettes. It also presents a darker sound than its predecessor. ''Geogaddi'' received universal acclaim from music critics.\n\nIt was described by Sandison as \"a record for some sort of trial-by-fire, a claustrophobic, twisting journey that takes you into some pretty dark experiences before you reach the open air again.\"<ref>[http://fredd-e.narfum.org/formerboc/interviews/#oor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727112740/http://fredd-e.narfum.org/formerboc/interviews/#oor|date=27 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nTheir third album for [[Warp Records]], ''[[The Campfire Headphase]]'', was released on 17 October 2005 in [[Europe]] and 18 October 2005 in the [[United States]]. The album featured fifteen tracks, including \"Peacock Tail\", \"Chromakey Dreamcoat,\" and \"[[Dayvan Cowboy]]\". Two versions of \"Dayvan Cowboy\" \u2014 the original and a remix by [[Odd Nosdam]] \u2014 are on the six-track EP, ''[[Trans Canada Highway (EP)|Trans Canada Highway]]'', which was released on 26 May 2006.\n\nIn late 2009, the ''[[Warp20 (Recreated)]]'' compilation featured two BoC covers, one by [[Bibio]] of their song \"Kaini Industries\" and one by [[Mira Calix]] of \"In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country\". [[Warp20 (Recreated)]] is part of the larger Warp20 boxed set, which also includes two previously unreleased Boards of Canada tracks, \"Seven Forty Seven\" and a 1.8 second sample of the song \"Spiro\", which had previously been performed at their show at the Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party in 2000.\n\n===''Tomorrow's Harvest'' (2013)===\nOn [[Record Store Day]] 2013, a vinyl record containing a short clip of music which was believed to be the work of Boards of Canada surfaced at the New York record store [[Other Music]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Sean Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/22/boards-of-canada-clue-new-album |title=Does Boards of Canada's record-store clue point to new album? &#124; Music |work=The Guardian|date=22 April 2013 |access-date=15 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=guardian>{{cite web|last1=Pattison|first1=Louis|title=Boards of Canada: 'We've become a lot more nihilistic over the years'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/06/boards-of-canada-become-more-nihilistic|website=The Guardian|access-date=12 September 2014|date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Shortly after the release, Warp Records vouched for the record's authenticity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/50420-boards-of-canada-released-a-mysterious-12-on-record-store-day/ |title=Boards of Canada Released a Mysterious 12\" on Record Store Day &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=21 April 2013 |access-date=15 June 2013}}</ref> The record (titled ''------/------/------/XXXXXX/------/------'') contained a short clip of audio followed by a voice reading six digits similar to that of a [[numbers station]].
