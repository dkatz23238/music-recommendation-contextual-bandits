They formed in 1993 with lead vocalist [[Benjamin Kowalewicz]], guitarist [[Ian D'Sa]], bassist Jonathan Gallant, and drummer [[Aaron Solowoniuk]]. There have been no lineup changes, although Solowoniuk is currently taking a hiatus from the band due to a relapse of [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[Jordan Hastings]] is currently filling in for him. In the 28 years since their inception, Billy Talent has sold well over a million physical albums in Canada alone and nearly 3 million albums internationally. Between 1995 and 2016, Billy Talent were the 27th-best-selling Canadian artist in Canada and among the top 10 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bdsradio.com/pd/docs/Nielsen_Canadian150_2017_vs2.pdf|title=NIELSEN MUSIC & BILLBOARD PRESENT CANADA 150 CHARTS|website=bdsradio.com|page=28|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band existed for almost a decade before mainstream success. The members met and played in [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School]] under the name '''Pezz''' and remained underground in [[Toronto]]'s indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of [[Warner Music Canada]]'s [[A&R]] department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success.<ref name=\"Accessmag\"/> Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada<ref name=CRIA0107>\n{{cite web|date=January 2007|title=CRIA Gold and Platinum Certifications for January 2007|url=http://www.cria.ca/gold/0107_g.php|publisher=[[Canadian Recording Industry Association]]|access-date=July 4, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526084701/http://www.cria.ca/gold/0107_g.php|archive-date=May 26, 2010}}</ref> and continues to expand their success overseas; this included touring for 20 months supporting their [[Billy Talent II|second album]]. They released their third album, ''[[Billy Talent III]]'', in 2009, and their fourth album, ''[[Dead Silence (album)|Dead Silence]]'', in 2012.

In 2015, they began to prepare material for their fifth studio album. Just before entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk decided to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with [[multiple sclerosis]]. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and, in early 2016, the group completed work on ''[[Afraid of Heights (Billy Talent album)|Afraid of Heights]]'', which was released in July of that year. The band's most recent album is ''[[Crisis of Faith (album)|Crisis of Faith]]'', released in January 2022.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins as Pezz (1993\u20131999)===\n<!-- {{Listen|type=sound|filename=Pezz - M & M.ogg|title=M & M|description=A sample of \"M & M\" from the album ''[[Watoosh!]]'', the band's first album.

Pezz began writing, performing songs, and gaining attention and credibility at first locally, and soon in [[Toronto]]'s broader [[Independent music|indie music]] scene. Their first recording was a cheap 4-track demo. It was recorded in Ian D'Sa's basement in July 1994 and was named ''Demoluca'', after a friend of the band named Jason Deluca had stopped by the house, banging on a basement window while the band was recording. Soon after, in January 1995, they all put in money to record another demo of better quality with engineer/producer Dave Tedesco at the \"Signal to Noise\" studio which they called ''[[Dudebox]]''.<ref name=BeforeFamous>\"Before They Were Famous\". {{cite web |url=http://www.exploremusic.com/ongoing-history-of-new-music/2009-05-27/Ongoing-History-On-Air-Schedule-Since-1993 |title=The Ongoing History of New Music |date=November 11, 2005 |publisher=[[CFNY]] }}</ref> Originally, two tracks from ''Demoluca'' and four newly recorded tracks were compiled onto it, but a year later the band recorded four more tunes live in the studio and re-released it. After these releases and their continued performances in the immediate area, Pezz was gaining a following in Mississauga and it continued to spread.<ref name=PezzBio>Bowman, Trevor. {{cite web |url=http://www.billytalent.com/pezz/bio.html |title=BIO |publisher=billytalent.com |access-date=September 4, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917140346/http://www.billytalent.com/pezz/bio.html |archive-date=September 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\nD'Sa studied classical animation at [[Sheridan College]], and even worked on [[Angela Anaconda]] as an animator. Gallant almost finished a business degree. Kowalewicz was in between jobs, one which included working at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]]. Solowoniuk worked at [[Chrysler Canada]]. But during this, each member found the time and finances to max-out their credit cards, and record their first full-length album in 1999.<ref name=BeforeFamous/> They laid down twelve tracks at a studio called \"Great Big Music\", collaborating with [[Juno Award|Juno]]-nominated music producer Brad Nelson. Kowalewicz started singing in melody with D'Sa. The music began to transform from \"raw rap-rock\" songs into \"catchy and angst-ridden pop-punk anthems\". With that, ''[[Watoosh!]]'' was born and independently released.<ref name=PezzBio/> While popular within Toronto's [[indie (music)|indie]] scene, it did not reach large mainstream sales levels.<ref name=BeforeFamous/>\n\n=== ''Billy Talent'' and success (1999\u20132004) ===\nIn 1999, the Canadian Pezz received documentation from an American band named Pezz proving that the latter had held the name internationally since 1989. The Canadian band had no legal claim to their old name and thus changed it to Billy Talent, inspired by the guitarist \"Billy Tallent\"<!-- This name was seen in a vision that Ben had involving riding a platypus going to the planet unicorn. When asked about this experience further Ben said \" Dude you just had to be there\" --> from [[Michael Turner (musician)|Michael Turner]]'s novel ''[[Hard Core Logo]]''.

During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]], the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her to check out the band's performance at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by [[Warner Music Canada]] to work in [[A&R]]. This connection would get the band their producer [[Gavin Brown (musician)|Gavin Brown]], and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called [[Atlantic Records]] A&R executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space.<ref name=Accessmag/>\n\n[[File:MuchMusic Video Awards 2007 729.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right: Jonathan Gallant, Ian D'Sa, Aaron Solowoniuk, and Benjamin Kowalewicz.]]\n\nIn 2002, the band met with record executives, and ended up signing a co-venture agreement with [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Warner Music Canada]].<ref name=Accessmag/> In the fall of 2003, the band released their full-length self-titled album, ''[[Billy Talent (album)|Billy Talent]]''. The album found considerable sales success. \"[[Try Honesty]]\" was a successful first single, and was followed by other singles \"[[The Ex (song)|The Ex]]\", \"[[River Below]]\", and \"[[Nothing to Lose (Billy Talent song)|Nothing to Lose]]\" into late 2003 and 2004. The band played sold-out shows in Canada and the United States and had success in Europe. The band received a [[Juno Award|Juno]], (They won two Junos, Best Album of the Year, and Best Band of the Year) and [[MuchMusic Video Award]] nominations and awards, and spent late 2004 and most of 2005 touring. ''Billy Talent'' went on to be certified 3\u00d7 platinum in Canada.<ref name=CRIA0107/>\n\nA track from the album titled \"This Is How It Goes\" was about Aaron Solowoniuk's fight with [[multiple sclerosis]]. On March 17, 2006, Aaron Solowoniuk revealed in a personal letter to fans that he was the friend in that song. Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease, which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision, in January 1999. His [[neurologist]] prescribed him medication that he would have to self inject three times a week, possibly for the rest of his life. Although it was a struggle for Solowoniuk to come to terms with the reality of the disease, going to numerous doctor appointments and touring with a mini-fridge in their van has become a normal routine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\n=== ''Billy Talent II'' (2005\u20132007) ===\n{{Listen|filename=Billy Talent - Devil in a Midnight Mass.ogg|title=Devil in a Midnight Mass|description=A sample of \"Devil in a Midnight Mass\" from the album ''[[Billy Talent II]]''.
