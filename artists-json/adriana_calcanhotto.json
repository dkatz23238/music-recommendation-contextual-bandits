Her melancholic songs are often categorized in the [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira|MPB]] genre. She began her professional career in 1984 and released her first studio album in 1990.\n\n==Career==\nBorn from musician Carlos Calcanhotto (originally Calcagnotto) of Italian origin from [[Volpago del Montello]], [[Veneto]], and from a Brazilian dancer.\nAdriana's first album, called ''Engui\u00e7o'', was released in 1990 and consisted mostly of covers of well known [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira|MPB]] (Brazilian pop) songs, part of the repertoire she used to perform as a singer in restaurants and bars in [[Porto Alegre]]. It included only one original composition, the title track. It spawned her first hit, a cover of [[Caetano Veloso]]'s ''Naquela Esta\u00e7\u00e3o'', which became successful thanks to it being included in the soundtrack of the [[Brazil|primetime soap]] ''Rainha da Sucata'', one of the most watched in history of Brazilian television.\n\n1992 saw the release of ''Senhas'', which included the hits \"Mentiras\" and \"Esquadros\" and was followed by a successful national tour. In 1994, Adriana, sporting a new look (short black hair as opposed to the slightly longer bright blond haircut she'd had since the beginning of her career) released ''A F\u00e1brica do Poema'', considered by many to be her most poetic album. She collaborated with lyricists like [[Waly Salom\u00e3o]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio C\u00edcero]] (brother and constant musical partner of fellow singer [[Marina Lima]]) and included the hits \"Metade\" and \"Inverno\". This was followed by ''[[Maritmo]]'' (a combination of the words ''mar\u00edtimo'' (maritime) and ''ritmo'' (rhythm)), a [[concept album]] intended as the first part of a trilogy having water as a main theme.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, Adriana experienced the peak of her career with the release of the album ''P\u00fablico'' in 2000. Her first live album/DVD, ''P\u00fablico'' was recorded in a ''voz-e-viol\u00e3o'' (voice and guitar) style, meaning there was no band, only the singer playing her acoustic guitar, an instrument which has followed her through her entire career. The album included a cover of the staple torch song ''Devolva-me'', made famous by the duo [[Leno & Lilian]] back in the 1960s. This album was followed by her first greatest hits compilation, ''Perfil'' (the success of this album prompted her record company to make it a series, releasing compilations of the same title by such artists as [[C\u00e1ssia Eller]], [[Z\u00e9lia Duncan]] and [[Djavan]]). Another album of new material wouldn't be released until 2002, when the singer released \"Cantada\". In the meantime, Adriana toured Europe and Japan (as she has done many times since).\n\nAfter the release of that album, Adriana took on the persona of Adriana Partimpim, an alias the singer claims to have used as a child. Adriana Partimpim released her self-titled \"debut\" in 2004, an album of covers featuring essentially traditional [[children's song]]s, but which also included familiar pop songs made to resemble children's songs. Examples of such songs are the covers of [[Paula Toller]]'s ''Oito Anos'' (a song Toller wrote for her own son, Gabriel) and [[Claudinho & Buchecha]]'s ''Fico Assim Sem Voc\u00ea'', which became a hit on adult radios. A live CD/DVD combo of the show was also released the following year.\n\nHer most recent album, ''Mar\u00e9'', was released in early 2008 and features a guest appearance by the singer's personal friend, [[Marisa Monte]] as well as a cover of [[Marina Lima]]'s song ''Tr\u00eas''. She toured Brazil to promote the record, as well as once again touring Europe, Japan and the United States. Adriana has chronicled her adventures on tour in the book ''Saga Lusa'' (Portuguese Saga), in which she shares her memoirs of the Portuguese leg of her most recent tour. The book was released on October 28 in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\nOn October 23, 2009, Adriana performed in front of an adoring crowd at the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] in [[Gatineau]], Quebec, Canada in a free performance presented by the Embassy of Brazil.\n\nSince 2015, Calcanhotto had joined  [[Universidade de Coimbra]] as a university ambassador, acting as [[Visiting scholar|visiting lecturer]] on song composition courses and as an [[artist-in-residence]].\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Sales\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Certification\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Engui\u00e7o''\n| \n* Released: 1990\n* Label: CBS/Columbia Records\n* Format: LP, CD\n|\n* BRA: 100,000\n|\n* ABPD: Gold\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Senhas''\n| \n* Released: 1992\n* Label: CBS/Columbia Records\n* Format: LP, CD\n|\n* BRA: 150,000\n|\n* ABPD: Gold\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''A F\u00e1brica do Poema''\n| \n* Released: 1994\n* Label:  Sony Music/Epic\n* Format: LP, CD\n|\n* BRA: 150,000\n|\n* ABPD: Gold\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Maritmo''\n| \n* Released: 1998\n* Label: Sony Music\n* Format: CD\n|\n* BRA: 150,000\n|\n* ABPD: Gold\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''P\u00fablico'' \n| \n* Released: 2000\n* Label: BMG\n* Format: CD\n|\n* BRA: 600,000\n|\n* ABPD: 2\u00d7 Platinum\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Perfil \u2013 Adriana Calcanhotto''\n| \n* Released: 2001\n* Label: [[Som Livre]]\n* Format: CD\n|\n* BRA: 500,000\n|\n* ABPD: 2\u00d7 Platinum\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Cantada''\n| \n* Released: 2002\n* Label: BMG\n* Format: CD\n|\n* BRA: 250,000\n|\n* ABPD: Platinum\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Adriana Partimpim]]''\n| \n* Released: 2004\n* Label: Sony BMG\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 200,000\n|\n* ABPD: Platinum\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Adriana Partimpim \u2013 O Show''\n| \n* Released: 2005\n* Label: BMG\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 200,000\n|\n* ABPD: Platinum\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Mar\u00e9''\n| \n* Released: 2008\n* Label: Sony/BMG\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 40,000\n|\n* ABPD: Gold\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Partimpim Dois''\n| \n* Released: 2009\n* Label: Sony Music\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 65,000\n|\n* ABPD: Gold\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Essencial''\n| \n* Released: 2010\n* Label: Sony Music\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 70,000\n|\n* ABPD: Gold\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''O Micr\u00f3bio do Samba''\n| \n* Released: 2011\n* Label: Sony Music\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 25,000\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Multishow ao Vivo: Micr\u00f3bio Vivo''\n| \n* Released: 2012\n* Label: Sony Music\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 5,000\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Partimpim Tl\u00eas''\n| \n* Released: 2012\n* Label: Sony Music\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 25,000\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Olhos de Onda''\n| \n* Released: 2014\n* Label: Sony Music\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 35,000\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Loucura''\n| \n* Released: 2015\n* Label: Sony Music\n* Format: CD, download digital\n|\n* BRA: 20,000\n|\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n{{Commons category|Adriana Calcanhotto}}\n* [http://www.adrianacalcanhotto.com Adriana Calcanhotto's official website (in Portuguese)]\n* [http://www.mpb4u.blogspot.com \"Musica Popular Brasileira e mais\"]\n* [http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/something-has-changed-in-brazil-an-interview-with-adriana-calcanhotto/ Something Has Changed In Brazil: An Interview with Adriana Calcanhotto]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Calcanhotto, Adriana}}\n[[Category:1965 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Brazilian women composers]]\n[[Category:21st-century Brazilian women singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century Brazilian singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century Brazilian women singers]]\n[[Category:Brazilian people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira singers]]\n[[Category:Latin Grammy Award winners]]\n[[Category:People from Porto Alegre]]\n[[Category:LGBT singers from Brazil]]\n[[Category:Latin music composers]]\n[[Category:Latin music songwriters]]\n[[Category:21st-century LGBT people]]\n[[Category:Women in Latin music]]\n[[Category:LGBT people in Latin music]]", "sha1": "6bps97ws709r195z27qoq7687annitj"}
