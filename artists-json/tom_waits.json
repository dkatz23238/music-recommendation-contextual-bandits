His lyrics often focus on the underbelly of society and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He worked primarily in [[jazz]] during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected greater influence from [[blues]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[vaudeville]], and [[Experimental music|experimental]] genres.\n\nWaits was born and raised in a middle-class family in [[California]]. Inspired by the work of [[Bob Dylan]] and the [[Beat Generation]], he began singing on the San Diego [[folk music]] circuit as a young man. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with [[Asylum Records]]. His first albums were the jazz-oriented ''[[Closing Time (album)|Closing Time]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Heart of Saturday Night]]'' (1974), which reflected his lyrical interest in nightlife, poverty, and criminality. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe, and Japan, and attracted greater critical recognition and commercial success with ''[[Small Change (Tom Waits album)|Small Change]]'' (1976), ''[[Blue Valentine (album)|Blue Valentine]]'' (1978), and ''[[Heartattack and Vine]]'' (1980). He produced the soundtrack for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[One from the Heart]]'' (1981), and subsequently made cameo appearances in several Coppola films.\n\nIn 1980, Waits married [[Kathleen Brennan]], split from his manager and record label, and moved to New York City. With Brennan's encouragement and frequent collaboration, he pursued a more experimental and eclectic musical aesthetic influenced by the work of [[Harry Partch]] and [[Captain Beefheart]]. This was reflected in a series of albums released by [[Island Records]], including ''[[Swordfishtrombones]]'' (1983), ''[[Rain Dogs]]'' (1985), and ''[[Franks Wild Years]]'' (1987). He continued appearing in films, notably starring in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Down by Law (film)|Down by Law]]'' (1986), and also made theatrical appearances. With theatre director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], he produced the musicals ''[[The Black Rider]]'' (1990) and ''Alice'' (1992), first performed in [[Hamburg]]. Having returned to California in the 1990s, his albums ''[[Bone Machine]]'' (1992), ''[[The Black Rider (album)|The Black Rider]]'' (1993), and ''[[Mule Variations]]'' (1999) earned him increasing critical acclaim and multiple Grammy Awards. In the late 1990s, he switched to the record label [[Anti- (record label)|ANTI-]], which released ''[[Blood Money (Tom Waits album)|Blood Money]]'' (2002), ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' (2002), ''[[Real Gone (album)|Real Gone]]'' (2004), and ''[[Bad as Me]]'' (2011).\n\nDespite a lack of mainstream commercial success, Waits has influenced many musicians and gained an international [[cult following]], and several biographies have been written about him.  In 2015, he was ranked at No. 55 on ''[[Rolling Stone magazine|Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]]\". He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2011.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood and adolescence: 1949\u20131971===\n\n[[File:Tom Waits (1968 yearbook senior portrait).jpg|thumb|alt=|Waits as a high-school senior at [[Hilltop High School (Chula Vista, California)|Hilltop High School]], 1968.

increasingly reclusive.{{sfn|Humphries|2007|p=xii}} Safeguarding the privacy of his family life became very important to him.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=453}}\n\nDuring interviews, he has deflected questions

of the Road: A Life of Tom Waits'', Waits and his wife asked people not to talk to him.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=xvi}} Hoskyns believed that it was Brennan who was responsible for the \"wall of

life.{{sfn|Humphries|2007|p=296}} According to Hoskyns, Waits hides behind his persona, noting that \"Tom Waits is as much of a character created for his fans as it is a real man\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=xvii}} In Hoskyns's view, Waits's self-image is in part \"a self-protective device, a screen to deflect attention\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=176}} A few music journalists have gone so far as to suggest that Waits is a \"poseur\".{{sfnm|1a1=Humphries|1y=2007|1pp=xii, 87|2a1=Hoskyns|2y=2009|2p=147}} Hoskyns regarded Waits's \"persona of the skid-row boho/hobo, a young man out of time and place\" as an \"ongoing experiment in performance art\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=xx}} He added that Waits has adopted a \"self-appointed role as the bard of the streets\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=156}} Mick Brown, a music journalist from ''Sounds'' who interviewed Waits in the mid-1970s, noted that \"he had immersed himself in this character to the point where it ''wasn't'' an act and had become an identity\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=151}} Louie Lista, a friend of Waits's during the 1970s, stated that the singer's general attitude was that of \"I'm an outsider, but I'll ''revel'' in being an outsider\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=127}} In a similar manner to contemporaries like Bob Dylan and Neil Young, Waits is known for cutting contact with figures he worked with

give \"his impression of how funky poor folk really are\", whereas in reality Waits was \"basically a middle-class, San Diego mom-and-pop-schoolteacher kid\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=127}} Humphries thought that there was a \"conservative element\" to Waits's persona, stating that behind his public image, \"Waits has always been more of a white-picket-fence kind of guy than you might imagine.\"{{sfn|Humphries|2007|p=134}}\n\nJarmusch described Waits as \"a very contradictory character\", stating that he is \"potentially violent if he thinks someone is ''screwing'' with him, but

suggested that Waits has had an \"on-off affair with alcohol, never quite able to shake it off\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|pp=346\u2013347}} During the 1970s, he was known as a heavy drinker and a smoker but

scene.{{sfn|Humphries|2007|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nDuring interviews, Waits has avoided questions about his personal life, gone off on tangents, and thrown in trivia.{{sfn|Humphries|2007|p=295}} Humphries noted that Waits has often supplied interviewers with \"droll one-liners\", something he termed \"Waitsisms\", observing that the singer was \"dripping with wit and vinegar\".{{sfn|Humphries|2007|p=217}} Waits is known for getting irate with journalists.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=455}} \nHe dislikes touring,{{sfnm|1a1=Humphries|1y=2007|1p=298|2a1=Hoskyns|2y=2009|2p=155}} but Hoskyns added that he has \"a strong work ethic\".{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=160}} He has a hatred of the
