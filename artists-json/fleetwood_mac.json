Fleetwood Mac were founded by guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]] and guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]], before bassist [[John McVie]] joined the line-up for their [[Fleetwood Mac (1968 album)|self-titled debut album]]. [[Danny Kirwan]] joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist and vocalist [[Christine McVie|Christine Perfect]], who contributed as a session musician from the second album, married McVie and joined in 1970.\n\nPrimarily a [[British blues]] band at first, Fleetwood Mac scored a UK number one with \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\",<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Fleetwood Mac Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/fleetwood-mac/biography|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=28 August 2017|archive-date=11 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711154402/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/fleetwood-mac/biography|url-status=live}}</ref> and had other hits such as the singles \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\", \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\", and \u201c[[The Green Manalishi]]\u201d. All three guitarists left in succession during the early 1970s, to be replaced by guitarists [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] and [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]] and vocalist [[Dave Walker]]. By 1974, Welch, Weston and Walker had all either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist. In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard American folk-rock duo [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]]. He asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and Buckingham agreed on the condition that Nicks could also join the band.\n\nThe addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more [[pop rock]] sound, and their 1975 self-titled album, ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'', reached No. 1 in the United States. ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in countries around the world and won a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1978. ''Rumours'' has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[list of best-selling albums|best-selling albums in history]]. Although each member of the band went through a breakup (John and Christine McVie, Buckingham and Nicks, and Fleetwood and his wife Jenny) while recording the album, they continued to write and record music together.\n\nThe band's personnel remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks each left the band, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists and vocalists. A 1993 one-off performance for the [[first inauguration of Bill Clinton]] featured the line-up of Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham back together for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and the group released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' (1997), a live compilation of their hits, also marking the 20th anniversary of ''Rumours''. Christine McVie left the band in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. Meanwhile, the group remained together as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'', in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined the band full-time in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-fires-lindsey-buckingham-w518925|title=Fleetwood Mac Fires Lindsey Buckingham|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=9 April 2018|access-date=10 June 2018|archive-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612145735/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-fires-lindsey-buckingham-w518925|url-status=live}}</ref> and replaced by [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], formerly of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and [[Neil Finn]] of [[Split Enz]] and [[Crowded House]].\n\nFleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling bands]].

Mayall gave Green free recording time as a gift, which Fleetwood, McVie and Green used to record five songs. The fifth song was an instrumental that Green named after the rhythm section, \"Fleetwood Mac\" (\"Mac\" being short for McVie).\n\nSoon after this, Green suggested to Fleetwood that they form a new band. The pair wanted McVie on bass guitar and named the band 'Fleetwood Mac' to entice him, but McVie opted to keep his steady income with Mayall rather than take a risk with a new band. In the meantime Green and Fleetwood teamed up with slide guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]] and bassist [[Bob Brunning]]. Brunning was in the band on the understanding that he would leave if McVie agreed to join. The Green, Fleetwood, Spencer, Brunning version of the band made its debut on 13 August 1967 at the Windsor Jazz and Blues Festival as 'Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, also featuring Jeremy Spencer'.

He was in the South London blues trio Boilerhouse, consisting of Kirwan (guitar), Trevor Stevens (bass) and Dave Terrey (drums).<ref>{{cite book|last=Rawlings|first=Terry|title=Then, now and rare British Beat 1960\u20131969|year=2002|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-9094-8|page=77}}</ref> Green and Fleetwood had watched Boilerhouse rehearse in a basement boiler-room, and Green had been so impressed that he invited the band to play support slots for Fleetwood Mac. Green wanted Boilerhouse to become a professional band but Stevens and Terrey were not prepared to turn professional, so Green tried to find another rhythm section for Kirwan by placing an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. There were over 300 applicants, but when Green and Fleetwood ran auditions at the Nag's Head in Battersea (home of the [[Mike Vernon (producer)|Mike Vernon]] [[Blue Horizon (record label)|Blue Horizon]] Club) the hard-to-please Green could not find anyone good enough. Fleetwood invited Kirwan to join Fleetwood Mac as a third guitarist.<ref name=\"Brunning p18\" />\n\nGreen was frustrated that Jeremy Spencer did not contribute to his songs. Kirwan, a talented self-taught guitarist, had a signature vibrato and a unique style that added a new dimension to the band's sound. In November 1968, with Kirwan in the band, they released their first number one single in Europe, \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\", on which Kirwan duetted with Green. Green said later that the success of 'Albatross' was thanks to Kirwan. \"If it wasn't for Danny, I would never have had a number one hit record.\"<ref name=\"vaudeville\">{{cite AV media notes|author= Fleetwood Mac |title= The Vaudeville Years |title-link= The Vaudeville Years |type= CD booklet notes |year= 1998 |publisher= Receiver Records }}</ref> In January 1969 they released their first compilation album ''[[English Rose (album)|English Rose]]'', which contained half of ''Mr Wonderful'' plus new songs from Kirwan. Their next and more successful compilation album ''[[The Pious Bird of Good Omen]]'' was released in August and contained various singles, B-sides and tracks the band had done with [[Eddie Boyd]].\n\nOn tour in the US in January 1969, the band recorded ''[[Fleetwood Mac in Chicago]]'' (released in December as a double album) at the soon-to-close [[Chess Records]] Studio with some of the blues legends of Chicago, including [[Willie Dixon]], [[Buddy Guy]] and [[Otis Spann]]. These were Fleetwood Mac's last all-blues recordings. Along with the change of style the band was also going through label changes. Until that point they had been on the Blue Horizon label, but with Kirwan in the band the musical possibilities had become too diverse for a blues-only label. The band signed with [[Immediate Records]] and released the single \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\", which became another British and European hit. For the B-side Spencer fronted Fleetwood Mac as \"Earl Vince and the Valiants\" and recorded \"[[Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonite]]\", typifying the more raucous rock 'n' roll side of the band. Immediate Records was in bad shape, however, and the band shopped around for a new deal. [[The Beatles]] wanted the band on [[Apple Records]] (Mick Fleetwood and [[George Harrison]] were brothers-in-law), but the band's manager [[Clifford Davis (musician)|Clifford Davis]] decided to go with [[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]] (through [[Reprise Records]], a [[Frank Sinatra]]-founded label), the label they have stayed with ever since.\n\nUnder the wing of Reprise, Fleetwood Mac released their third studio album, ''[[Then Play On]]'', in September 1969. Although the initial pressing of the American release of this album was the same as the British version, it was altered to contain the song \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\", which featured consistently in live performances from the time of its release through 1997 and again starting in 2009. ''Then Play On'', the band's first rock album, was written by Kirwan and Green, plus a track each by Fleetwood and McVie. Jeremy Spencer, meanwhile, had recorded [[Jeremy Spencer (album)|a solo album]] of 1950s-style rock and roll songs, backed by the rest of the band except Green.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/jeremy-spencer-mw0000849643|title=Jeremy Spencer \u2013 Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=6 October 2019|archive-date=6 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006023617/https://www.allmusic.com/album/jeremy-spencer-mw0000849643|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBy 1970, Green, the frontman of the band, was using [[LSD]]. During the band's European tour, he experienced a bad acid trip at a hippie commune in Munich.

After several days of frantic searching the band discovered that Spencer had joined a religious group, the [[Children of God (cult)|Children of God]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Fong-Torres|first1=Ben|title=Fleetwood Mac Stolen Away:Guitarist Jeremy Spencer leaves the band mysteriously just before their American tour|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-stolen-away-19710318|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=18 March 1971|access-date=14 February 2017|archive-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215124210/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-stolen-away-19710318|url-status=live}}</ref> The band were liable for the remaining shows on the tour and asked Peter Green to step in as a replacement. Green brought along his friend [[Nigel Watson]], who played the [[congas]]. (Twenty-five years later Green and Watson collaborated again to form the [[Peter Green Splinter Group]]). Green was only back with Fleetwood Mac temporarily and the band began a search for a new guitarist.<ref>SPL 1046 Stony Plain Records LP \"White Skies\" 1981 liner notes</ref> Green insisted on playing only new material and none he had written. He and Watson played only the last week of shows. The San Bernardino show on 20 February was taped.\n\nIn the summer of 1971, the band held auditions for a replacement guitarist at their large country home, \"Benifold\", which they had jointly bought with their manager Davis for \u00a323,000 ({{Inflation|UK|23000|1970|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) prior to the ''Kiln House'' tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/benifold.htm|title=Benifold|website=fleetwoodmac.net|access-date=8 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927041715/http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/benifold.htm|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> A friend of the band, Judy Wong, recommended her high school friend [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]], who was living in Paris, France, at the time. The band held a few meetings with Welch and decided to hire him, without actually playing with him, after they heard a tape of his songs.<ref name=\"Brunning, B 1998 p37\">Brunning, B (1998): Fleetwood Mac \u2013 The First 30 Years. London: Omnibus Press p37</ref>\n\nIn September 1971, the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Future Games]]''. As a result of Welch's arrival and Spencer's departure, the album was different from anything they had done previously. While it became the band's first studio album to miss the charts in the UK, it helped to expand the band's appeal in the United States. In Europe CBS released Fleetwood Mac's first [[Greatest Hits (1971 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]] album, which mostly consisted of songs by Peter Green, with one song by Spencer and one by Kirwan.\n\nIn 1972, six months after the release of ''Future Games'', the band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Bare Trees]]''. Mostly composed by Kirwan, ''Bare Trees'' featured the Welch-penned single \"[[Sentimental Lady]]\", which would be a much bigger hit for Welch five years later when he re-recorded it for his solo album ''[[French Kiss (Bob Welch album)|French Kiss]]'', backed by Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie. ''Bare Trees'' also featured \"Spare Me a Little of Your Love\", a bright Christine McVie song that became a staple of the band's live act throughout the early to mid-1970s.\n\nWhile the band was doing well in the studio, their tours started to be problematic. By 1972 Danny Kirwan had developed an alcohol dependency and was becoming alienated from Welch and the McVies. When Kirwan smashed his Gibson [[Les Paul Custom]] guitar before a concert on a US tour in August 1972, refused to go on stage and criticised the band afterwards, Fleetwood fired him.<ref name=\"brunning\">{{cite book | author-link=Bob Brunning | first=Bob | last=Brunning | title=Fleetwood Mac: Behind the Masks | publisher=New English Library | year=1990 | location=London | isbn=0-450-53116-3 | oclc=22242160}}</ref> Fleetwood said later that the pressure had become too much for Kirwan, and he had suffered a breakdown.<ref name=\"Farber\">{{cite web |last1=Farber |first1=Jim |title=Fleetwood Mac's Forgotten Hero |url=https://web.musicaficionado.com/main.html#!/article/fleetwood_macs_forgotten_hero_by_jimfarber |website=Music Aficionado |access-date=5 December 2018 |archive-date=5 August 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170805005553/https://web.musicaficionado.com/main.html%23!/collection/alexlifeson-1457922214322#!/article/fleetwood_macs_forgotten_hero_by_jimfarber |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the three albums they released in this period they constantly changed line-ups. In September 1972 the band added guitarist [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]] and vocalist [[Dave Walker]], formerly of [[Savoy Brown]] and [[The Idle Race|Idle Race]].<ref name=\"Music Legends\">{{cite web|publisher=Music Legends|url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-walker-interview-black-sabbath/|title=Dave Walker Interview|access-date=6 May 2013|date=30 December 2011|last=Saulnier|first=Jason|archive-date=6 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006223626/http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-walker-interview-black-sabbath/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Bob Weston was well known as a slide guitarist and had known the band from his touring period with [[Long John Baldry]]. Fleetwood Mac also hired Savoy Brown's road manager, John Courage. Fleetwood, The McVies, Welch, Weston and Walker recorded the band's seventh studio album, ''[[Penguin (album)|Penguin]]'', which was released in January 1973. After the tour the band fired Walker because they felt his vocal style and attitude did not fit well with the rest of the band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy 45th: Fleetwood Mac, Penguin|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/happy-45th-fleetwood-mac-penguin|website=Rhino|access-date=12 April 2019|archive-date=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412185548/https://www.rhino.com/article/happy-45th-fleetwood-mac-penguin|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining five members carried on and recorded the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Mystery to Me]]'', six months later. This album contained Welch's song \"[[Hypnotized (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hypnotized]]\", which received a great amount of airplay on the radio and became one of the band's most successful songs to date in the US. The band was proud of the new album and anticipated that it would be a smash hit. While it did eventually go Gold, personal problems within the band emerged. The McVies' marriage was under a lot of stress, which was aggravated by their constant working with each other and by John McVie's considerable [[alcohol abuse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\"McVie, John.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed.|url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/18632|website=Oxford Music Online|access-date=20 July 2014}}</ref> Subsequent lack of touring meant that the album was unable to chart as high as the previous one.\n\nDuring the 1973 US tour to promote ''Mystery to Me'', Weston had an affair with Fleetwood's wife [[Jenny Boyd]] Fleetwood, sister of [[Pattie Boyd]] Harrison.

In the same month the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Heroes Are Hard to Find]]''. This was the first time Fleetwood Mac had only one guitarist. While on tour they added a second keyboardist, Doug Graves, who had been an engineer on ''Heroes Are Hard to Find''. In late 1974 Graves was preparing to become a permanent member of the band by the end of their US tour. He said:\n\n{{blockquote|I'm looking forward to adding something to this already great band.

In 1980, Christine McVie explained the decision:\n\n{{blockquote|He (Doug Graves) was there to back me up, but I think it was decided after the first two or three concerts that I was better off without him.

Neither musician proved to be a long-term addition to the line-up. Welch left soon after the tour ended (on 5 December 1974 at Cal State University), having grown tired of touring and legal struggles.

Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie's \"[[Over My Head (Fleetwood Mac song)|Over My Head]]\" and \"[[Say You Love Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Say You Love Me]]\" and Stevie Nicks's \"[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]\", as well as the much-played album track \"[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]\", a live rendition of which became a hit twenty years later on ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' album.\n{{Listen|filename=Landslide by Fleetwood Mac.ogg|title=\"Landslide\" (Fleetwood Mac)|description=17 second sample from Fleetwood Mac's song \"Landslide\".| format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nIn 1976, the band was suffering from severe stress. With success came the end of John and Christine McVie's marriage, as well as Buckingham and Nicks's long-term romantic relationship. Fleetwood, meanwhile, was in the midst of divorce proceedings from his wife, Jenny. The pressure on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-up album, combined with their new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions which were allegedly fuelled by high consumption of drugs and alcohol.<ref name=\"Rock Nuns\">{{cite web |last1=Jonze |first1=Tim |title=Fleetwood Mac's Stevie and Christine: 'We were like rock'n'roll nuns' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/12/fleetwood-mac-stevie-nicks-christine-mcvie-nuns |website=The Guardian |date=12 December 2013 |access-date=3 October 2018 |archive-date=4 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004192005/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/12/fleetwood-mac-stevie-nicks-christine-mcvie-nuns |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe band's eleventh studio album, ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (the band's first release on the main Warner label after Reprise was retired and all of its acts were reassigned to the parent label), was released in February 1977. In this album, the band members laid bare the emotional turmoil they were experiencing at the time. ''Rumours'' was critically acclaimed and won the [[Grammy]] Award for Album of the Year in 1977. The album generated four Top Ten singles: Buckingham's \"[[Go Your Own Way]]\", Nicks's US No. 1 \"[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]\", and Christine McVie's \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\" and \"[[You Make Loving Fun]]\". Buckingham's \"[[Second Hand News]]\", Nicks's \"[[Gold Dust Woman]]\", and \"[[The Chain]]\" (the only song written by all five band members) also received significant radio airplay. By 2003 ''Rumours'' had sold over 19 million copies in the US alone (certified as a [[diamond album]] by the [[RIAA]]) and a total of 40 million copies worldwide, bringing it to eighth on the [[list of best-selling albums]]. Fleetwood Mac supported the album with a lucrative tour.\n\nOn 10 October 1979, Fleetwood Mac were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contributions to the music industry at 6608 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/fleetwood-mac|title=Fleetwood Mac {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=15 June 2016|archive-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812181905/http://www.walkoffame.com/fleetwood-mac|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/fleetwood-mac/|title=Fleetwood Mac|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=15 June 2016|archive-date=3 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603033724/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/fleetwood-mac/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBuckingham convinced Fleetwood to let his work on their next album be more experimental and to be allowed to work on tracks at home before bringing them to the rest of the band in the studio. The result of this, the band's twelfth studio album ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', was a 20-track double album released in 1979. It produced three hit singles: Buckingham's \"[[Tusk (song)|Tusk]]\" (US No. 8), which featured the [[Spirit of Troy|USC Trojan Marching Band]], Christine McVie's \"[[Think About Me]]\" (US No. 20), and \nNicks's six-and-a-half minute opus \"[[Sara (Fleetwood Mac song)|Sara]]\" (US No. 7). \"Sara\" was cut to four-and-a-half minutes for both the hit single and the first CD-release of the album, but the unedited version has since been restored on the [[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|1988 greatest hits compilation]], the 2004 reissue of ''Tusk'' and Fleetwood Mac's 2002 release of ''[[The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac]]''. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions of ''Tusk'' although his playing, on the Christine McVie track \"Brown Eyes\", is not credited on the album.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac| url=https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet| url-access=registration|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet/page/214 214]| isbn=9780380716166}}</ref> In an interview in 2019 Fleetwood described ''Tusk'' as his \"personal favourite\" and said, \u201cKudos to Lindsey ... for us not doing a replica of ''Rumours''.\"<ref>{{cite news|work= Independent |url=  https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/fleetwood-mac-interview-tour-uk-wembley |title= Fleetwood Mac: We'll Burn in Hell if We Don't Play Glastonbury One Day: Chris Harvey |date= 27 April 2019 |access-date= 30 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n''Tusk'' sold four million copies worldwide. Fleetwood blamed the album's relative lack of commercial success on the [[RKO General|RKO]] radio chain having played the album in its entirety prior to release, thereby allowing mass home taping.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac| url=https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet| url-access=registration|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet/page/219 219]| isbn=9780380716166}}</ref>\n\nThe band embarked on an 11-month tour to support and promote ''Tusk''. They travelled around the world, including the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, they shared the bill with reggae superstar [[Bob Marley]]. On this world tour, the band recorded music for their first [[Live (Fleetwood Mac album)|live album]], which was released at the end of 1980.\n\nThe band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'', was released in 1982. Following 1981 solo albums by Nicks (''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]''), Fleetwood (''[[The Visitor (Mick Fleetwood album)|The Visitor]]''), and Buckingham (''[[Law and Order (album)|Law and Order]]''), there was a return to a more conventional approach. Buckingham had been chided by critics, fellow band members, and music business managers for the lesser commercial success of ''Tusk''. Recorded at [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] in France and produced by [[Richard Dashut]], ''Mirage'' was an attempt to recapture the huge success of ''Rumours''. Its hits included Christine McVie's \"[[Hold Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hold Me]]\" and \"[[Love in Store]]\" (cowritten by [[Robbie Patton]] and Jim Recor, respectively), Nicks's \"[[Gypsy (Fleetwood Mac song)|Gypsy]]\", and Buckingham's \"[[Oh Diane]]\", which made the Top 10 in the UK. A minor hit was also scored by Buckingham's \"Eyes of the World\" and \"[[Can't Go Back (Fleetwood Mac song)|Can't Go Back]]\".\n\nIn contrast to the [[Tusk Tour]] the band embarked on only a short tour of 18 American cities, the Los Angeles show being recorded and released on video. They also headlined the first [[US Festival]], on 5 September 1982, for which the band was paid $500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1982|r=0}}}} today). ''Mirage'' was certified double platinum in the US.\n\nFollowing ''Mirage'' the band went on hiatus, which allowed members to pursue solo careers. Nicks released two more solo albums (1983's ''[[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]]'' and 1985's ''[[Rock a Little]]''). Buckingham issued ''[[Go Insane (album)|Go Insane]]'' in 1984, the same year that Christine McVie made an [[Christine McVie (album)|eponymous album]] (yielding the Top 10 hit \"[[Got a Hold on Me]]\" and the Top 40 hit \"[[Love Will Show Us How]]\"). All three met with success, Nicks being the most popular. During this period Fleetwood had filed for bankruptcy, Nicks was admitted to the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] for addiction problems and John McVie had suffered an addiction-related seizure, all of which were attributed to the lifestyle of excess afforded to them by their worldwide success. It was rumoured that Fleetwood Mac had disbanded, but Buckingham commented that he was unhappy at allowing ''Mirage'' to remain the band's last effort.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=785&c=18 |title=Fleetwood Mac: Return Without Leaving |work=[[Creem]] |last=Kordosh |first=J. |date=September 1987 |access-date=25 October 2011 |archive-date=27 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527211656/http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=785&c=18 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Rumours'' line-up of Fleetwood Mac recorded one more album, their fourteenth studio album, ''[[Tango in the Night]]'', in 1987. As with various other Fleetwood Mac albums, the material started off as a Buckingham solo album before becoming a group project. The album went on to become their best-selling release since ''Rumours'', especially in the UK where it hit No. 1 three times in the following year. The album sold three million copies in the US and contained four hits: Christine McVie's \"[[Little Lies]]\" and \"[[Everywhere (Fleetwood Mac song)|Everywhere]]\" (\"Little Lies\" being cowritten with McVie's new husband, Eddy Quintela), [[Sandy Stewart (musician)|Sandy Stewart]] and Nicks's \"[[Seven Wonders (song)|Seven Wonders]]\", and Buckingham's \"[[Big Love (Fleetwood Mac song)|Big Love]]\". \"[[Family Man (Fleetwood Mac song)|Family Man]]\" (Buckingham and [[Richard Dashut]]) and \"[[Isn't It Midnight]]\" (Christine McVie) were also released as singles, with less success.\n\n===1987\u20131995: Departure of Buckingham and Nicks===\nWith a ten-week tour scheduled, Buckingham held back at the last minute, saying he felt his creativity was being stifled. A group meeting at Christine McVie's house on 7 August 1987 resulted in turmoil. Tensions were coming to a head. Fleetwood said in his autobiography that there was a physical altercation between Buckingham and Nicks. Buckingham left the band the following day.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} After Buckingham's departure, Fleetwood Mac added two new guitarists to the band, [[Billy Burnette]] and [[Rick Vito]], again without auditions.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Ressner|first1=Jeffrey|title=Lindsey Buckingham Leaves Fleetwood Mac|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lindsey-buckingham-leaves-fleetwood-mac-19870924|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=24 September 1987|access-date=24 February 2017|archive-date=7 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407215542/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lindsey-buckingham-leaves-fleetwood-mac-19870924|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBurnette was the son of [[Dorsey Burnette]] and nephew of [[Johnny Burnette]], both of [[The Rock and Roll Trio]]. He had already worked with Fleetwood in Zoo, with Christine McVie as part of her solo band, had done some session work with Nicks, and backed Buckingham on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Fleetwood and Christine McVie had played on his ''Try Me'' album in 1985. Vito, a Peter Green admirer, had played with many artists from [[Bonnie Raitt]] to John Mayall, to [[Roger McGuinn]] in [[Thunderbyrd]] and worked with John McVie on two Mayall albums.\n\nThe 1987\u201388 \"Shake the Cage\" tour was the first outing for this line-up. It was successful enough to warrant the release of a concert video, entitled \"Tango in the Night\", which was filmed at San Francisco's [[Cow Palace]] arena in December 1987.\n\nCapitalising on the success of ''Tango in the Night'', the band released a ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in 1988. It featured singles from the 1975\u20131988 era and included two new compositions, \"[[No Questions Asked (Fleetwood Mac song)|No Questions Asked]]\" written by Nicks and \"[[As Long as You Follow]]\", written by Christine McVie and Quintela. 'As Long as You Follow' was released as a single in 1988 but only made No. 43 in the US and No.66 in the UK, although it reached No.1 on the US Adult Contemporary charts. The ''Greatest Hits'' album, which peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US (though it has since sold over 8 million copies there) was dedicated by the band to Buckingham, with whom they were now reconciled.\n\nIn 1990, Fleetwood Mac released their fifteenth studio album, ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]''. With this album, the band veered away from the stylised sound that Buckingham had evolved during his tenure (which was also evident in his solo work) and developed a more [[adult contemporary]] style with producer [[Greg Ladanyi]]. The album yielded only one Top 40 hit, Christine McVie's \"[[Save Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Save Me]]\". ''Behind the Mask'' only achieved [[RIAA certification|Gold]] album status in the US, peaking at No. 18 on the ''Billboard'' album chart, though it entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1. It received mixed reviews and was seen by some music critics as a low point for the band in the absence of Buckingham (who had actually made a guest appearance playing on the title track). But ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine said that Vito and Burnette were \"the best thing to ever happen to Fleetwood Mac\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/behind-the-mask-19900531|title=''Behind the Mask'' review|last=Berger|first=Arion|date=31 May 1990|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=23 February 2012|archive-date=28 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228030534/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/behind-the-mask-19900531|url-status=live}}</ref> The subsequent \"Behind the Mask\" tour saw the band play sold-out shows at London's Wembley Stadium. In the final show in Los Angeles, Buckingham joined the band onstage. The two women of the band, McVie and Nicks, had decided that the tour would be their last (McVie's father had died during the tour), although both stated that they would still record with the band. In 1991, however, Nicks and Rick Vito left Fleetwood Mac altogether.\n\nIn 1992, Fleetwood arranged a 4-disc box set, spanning highlights from the band's 25-year history, entitled ''[[25 Years \u2013 The Chain]]'' (an edited 2-disc set was also available). A notable inclusion in the box set was \"[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]\", a Nicks composition that was recorded during the ''Rumours'' sessions but was omitted from the album and used as the B-side of \"Go Your Own Way\". Nicks had requested use of this track for her 1991 best-of compilation ''TimeSpace'', but Fleetwood had refused as he had planned to include it in this collection as a rarity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The disagreement between Nicks and Fleetwood garnered press coverage and was believed to have been the main reason for Nicks leaving the band in 1991.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Spanos |first1=Brittany |title='Silver Springs': Inside Fleetwood Mac's Great Lost Breakup Anthem |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=17 August 2017 |access-date=3 October 2018 |archive-date=6 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106213741/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The box set also included a new Nicks/Rick Vito composition, \"[[Paper Doll (Fleetwood Mac song)|Paper Doll]]\", which was released in the US as a single and produced by Buckingham and Richard Dashut.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boehm|first1=Mike|title=Life After Mac|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-10/news/ol-2617_1_fleetwood-mac/3|website=Los Angelis Times|date=10 December 1992|access-date=14 November 2016|archive-date=23 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423143200/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-10/news/ol-2617_1_fleetwood-mac/3|url-status=live}}</ref> There were also two new Christine McVie compositions, \"Heart of Stone\" and [[Love Shines (song)|\"Love Shines]]\". \"Love Shines\" was released as a single in the UK and elsewhere. Buckingham also contributed a new song, \"Make Me a Mask\". Fleetwood also released a deluxe hardcover companion book to coincide with the release of the box set, titled ''My 25 Years in Fleetwood Mac''. The volume featured notes written by Fleetwood detailing the band's 25-year history and many rare photographs.\n\nThe Buckingham/Nicks/McVie/McVie/Fleetwood lineup reunited in 1993 at the request of US President [[Bill Clinton]] for his first [[United States presidential inaugural balls|Inaugural Ball]]. Clinton had made Fleetwood Mac's \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\" his campaign theme song. His request for it to be performed at the Inauguration Ball was met with enthusiasm by the band, although this line-up had no intention of reuniting again.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Greene|first1=Andy|title=Flashback: Fleetwood Mac Reunite for Bill Clinton's Inauguration|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-fleetwood-mac-reunite-for-bill-clintons-inauguration-20130122|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=22 January 2013|access-date=23 February 2017|archive-date=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224053117/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-fleetwood-mac-reunite-for-bill-clintons-inauguration-20130122|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nInspired by the new interest in the band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Christine McVie recorded another album as Fleetwood Mac, with Billy Burnette taking lead guitar duties.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} Burnette left in March 1993 to record a country album and pursue an acting career and [[Bekka Bramlett]], who had worked a year earlier with Fleetwood's Zoo, was recruited to take his place.

Although it hit the UK Top 60 for one week, the album had zero impact in the US. It failed to graze the ''Billboard'' Top 200 albums chart, a reversal for a band that had been a mainstay on that chart for most of the previous two decades. Shortly after the album's release, Christine McVie informed the band that the album would be her last.

Bob Welch was not included, despite his key role in keeping the band alive during the early 1970s. The ''Rumours''-era version of the band performed both at the induction ceremony and at the Grammy Awards programme that year. Peter Green attended the induction ceremony but did not perform with his former bandmates, opting instead to perform his composition \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\" with [[Santana (band)|Santana]], who were inducted the same night. Neither Jeremy Spencer nor Danny Kirwan attended. Fleetwood Mac also received the \"Outstanding Contribution to Music\" award at the [[Brit Awards]] (British Phonographic Industry Awards) the same year.\n\nIn 1998 Christine McVie left the band. Her departure left Buckingham and Nicks to sing all the lead vocals for the band's seventeenth album, ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'', released in 2003, although Christine contributed some backing vocals and keyboards. The album debuted at No.3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart (No. 6 in the UK) and yielded chart hits with \"[[Peacekeeper (Fleetwood Mac song)|Peacekeeper]]\" and the title track, and a successful world arena tour which lasted through 2004.

Two days after their performance at the MusiCares event, he got a phone call from the band's manager Irving Azoff, who had a list of things that, as Buckingham puts it, \u201cStevie took issue with\u201d that evening, including the guitarist\u2019s outburst just before the band\u2019s set over the intro music for their acceptance speech being the studio recording of Nicks\u2019 \u201cRhiannon\u201d \u2014 and the way he \u201csmirked\u201d during Nicks\u2019 thank-you speech. Buckingham conceded the first point. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about it being \u2018Rhiannon,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cIt just undermined the impact of our entrance.

But I look over and Christine and Mick are doing the waltz behind her as a joke.\u201d At the end of that call, Buckingham assumed Nicks was quitting Fleetwood Mac. He wrote an e-mail to Fleetwood assuring the drummer that the group could continue. There was no reply. A couple of days later, Buckingham said, \u201cI called Irving and said, \u2018This feels funny. Is Stevie leaving the band, or am I getting kicked out?\u2019\u2009\u201d Azoff told the guitarist he was \u201cgetting ousted\u201d and that Nicks gave the rest of the band \u201can ultimatum: Either you go or she\u2019s gonna go.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lindsey-buckingham-fleetwood-mac-firing-733460/|title=Lindsey Buckingham: Life After Fleetwood Mac|first=David|last=Fricke|date=10 October 2018|website=rollingstone.com|access-date=10 October 2018|archive-date=11 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013912/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lindsey-buckingham-fleetwood-mac-firing-733460/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FleetMacTulsa031018-81 (30294522547).jpg|thumb|right|Fleetwood Mac in October 2018]]\n\nFormer [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] guitarist [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] and [[Neil Finn]] of [[Crowded House]] were named to replace Buckingham.<ref name=\"campbellfinn\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-fires-lindsey-buckingham-w518925 |title=Fleetwood Mac Fires Lindsey Buckingham |last=Greene |first=Andy |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=9 April 2018 |access-date=9 April 2018 |archive-date=10 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410134632/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-fires-lindsey-buckingham-w518925 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"fired\" /> On ''CBS This Morning'', Fleetwood said that Fleetwood Mac had been reborn and that \"This is the new lineup of Fleetwood Mac.\"<ref name=\"CBSThisMorning\" /> Aside from touring, the band plans to record new music with Campbell and Finn in the future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/09/fleetwood-mac-ellen-chain-gypsy/|title=Fleetwood Mac debut new lineup on Ellen: Watch|date=5 September 2018|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=5 September 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905201337/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/09/fleetwood-mac-ellen-chain-gypsy/|url-status=live}}</ref> The band's \"[[An Evening with Fleetwood Mac]]\" tour started in October 2018.
