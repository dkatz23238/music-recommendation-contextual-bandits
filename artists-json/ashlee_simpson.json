She later pursued a career as an actress and had a recurring role on the family drama ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]].'' She appeared on the reality show ''[[Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica]]'', broadcast on [[MTV]] between 2003 and 2005, which focused on Ashlee's older sister Jessica and Jessica's then-husband [[Nick Lachey]]. While working on her debut studio album, Simpson became the star of a spin-off reality series, ''[[The Ashlee Simpson Show]]'', which was broadcast on MTV between 2004 and 2005. Like her sister before her, Simpson became the center of considerable media attention.\n\nHer breakout came with her debut single, \"[[Pieces of Me (song)|Pieces of Me]]\", which was released in 2004, became a top-five hit in the United States and topped the [[Pop Songs|''Billboard'' Mainstream Top 40]] chart based on radio airplay. The success of the single and her reality show helped propel her debut album, ''[[Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)|Autobiography]],'' also released in 2004, to the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. The project sold over five million copies worldwide, making it her most successful album to date. Simpson had a leading role in the film ''[[Undiscovered]]'' (2005), which became a critical and commercial flop. The failure of the film, along with multiple critically panned performances, led to media scrutiny. Despite that, Simpson's second studio album, ''[[I Am Me (Ashlee Simpson album)|I Am Me]]'' (2005), debuted atop the ''Billboard'' 200, becoming her second album to do so. The album went on to receive a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nFollowing her appearance as Roxie Hart in the West End production of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]],'' Simpson announced that she had begun working on her third studio album. The album differed from the pop-rock sound of her previous efforts, featuring a dance-pop and 1980s-themed sound. ''[[Bittersweet World]]'' was released in 2008 to positive critical reception, but it saw a decline in sales. The effort reached number 4 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The following year, Simpson joined the main cast of the ''[[Melrose Place (2009 TV series)|Melrose Place]]'' revamp, which was met with harsh critical reception. Later that year, she made her Broadway debut reprising her role as Roxie Hart in ''Chicago'' on Broadway.\n\nSimpson announced a fourth studio album that same year. She independently released the single \"Bat for a Heart\" (2012), though it failed to have success. Simpson eventually scrapped the album and focused on her child. Simpson reprised her role as Roxie Hart for the third time in a 2-dates special production in [[Hollywood Bowl]] in July 2013 directed by [[Brooke Shields]]. In October, Simpson and her husband [[Evan Ross]] released their debut [[extended play]] (EP) by [[Ashlee + Evan]] through [[First Access Entertainment|Access Records]], which was supported by a tour in select cities across North America, and their [[Ashlee + Evan (TV series)|TV-reality show]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Ashlee-Simpson-and-Evan-Ross-Release-Debut-EP-and-Announce-Tour-Dates-20181012|title=Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross Release Debut EP and Announce Tour Dates|first=TV News|last=Desk}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1984\u20132002: Early life and career beginnings===\nAshley Nicole Simpson was born in [[Waco, Texas]], on October 3, 1984.<ref name=\"TXBI\">State of Texas.
