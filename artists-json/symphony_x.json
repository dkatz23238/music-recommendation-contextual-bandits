Romeo explained the band's name in a 2008 interview; \"So, you know, the music we were coming up with had the keyboard thing and the guitar, and some classical elements, so the word 'Symphony' came up and, so the dramatic thing, you know? So then, somebody said 'Symphony X' and we were like, 'yeah, that's cool' it is that kinda thing, and the 'X' is the unknown and all the other stuff we do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theheaviestmatteroftheuniverse.com/2009/01/16/interview-with-michael-romeo-of-symphony-x-4408/|title=Interview with Michael Romeo of Symphony X|date=April 4, 2008|website=Theheaviestmatteroftheuniverse.com|access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===''Symphony X'' and ''The Damnation Game'' (1994\u22121995)===\nIn early 1994 [[Michael Romeo]] (formerly of the bands Phantom's Opera and Gemini) recorded a studio album titled ''[[The Dark Chapter]]'', which featured himself and keyboard player [[Michael Pinnella]].<ref name=\"alloutguitar1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alloutguitar.com/interview/artists_and_bands/michael_romeo_interview_%E2%80%93_perfect_symphony_part_one_1970039s_2000 |title=A Perfect Symphony Part One: 1970's to 2000 |access-date=February 18, 2009 |author=Edwards, Owen |date=March 4, 2008 |website=Alloutguitar.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201135330/http://alloutguitar.com/interview/artists_and_bands/michael_romeo_interview_%E2%80%93_perfect_symphony_part_one_1970039s_2000 |archive-date=February 1, 2009 }}</ref> The tape attracted a fair share of attention, particularly in [[Japan]].<ref name=\"alloutguitar1\"/> Romeo then recruited bassist [[Thomas Miller (bassist)|Thomas Miller]], drummer [[Jason Rullo]], and vocalist [[Rod Tyler]].<ref name=\"progmetalblog\">{{cite web | url = http://progmetalblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/symphony-x.html | title = Symphony X | access-date = February 18, 2009 | work = PROG METAL BLOG | publisher = [[blogspot.com]] | date = January 9, 2007}}</ref> Their [[Symphony X (album)|self-titled debut album]] was recorded in the same year, and released to a positive reception in Japan by the now-defunct record company Zero Corporation.<ref name=\"officialromeo\">{{cite web | url = http://www.symphonyx.com/michael_romeo.html | title = Symphony X Band Info: Members: Michael Romeo | access-date = February 18, 2009 | publisher = symphonyx.com | date = July 5, 2005 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721164229/http://www.symphonyx.com/michael_romeo.html | archive-date = July 21, 2011}}</ref> The band's second studio album, ''[[The Damnation Game (album)|The Damnation Game]]'', followed six months later.

It took a considerable time to record the album, with the recording sessions taking place in 1996, and the album was released late in the year.\n\nAt the end of 1997 and for part of the next year, Jason Rullo, their drummer, had to stay away from the band in order to solve personal issues. He was temporarily replaced by Thomas Walling. Even with a temporary drummer, the band recorded ''[[Twilight in Olympus]]'', released in early 1998. That year also saw the first live performances from the band, which by then had already gathered many fans from around the globe. Their first official show happened in 1998, in [[Japan]]. It was soon followed by a world tour. Bassist Thomas Miller left the band and was replaced by [[Michael Lepond]] in that year.\n\nA compilation album, ''[[Prelude to the Millennium]]'', was released by the end of 1998. As an extra, it featured a second version of the song \"Masquerade\" from the first album, with Russell Allen on vocals.\n\n===''V: The New Mythology Suite'' and ''The Odyssey'' (1999\u22122005)===\nJason Rullo returned to the drums for the band's fifth album, ''[[V \u2013 The New Mythology Suite|V: The New Mythology Suite]]'', released in 2000. It was the band's first release on major progressive label [[InsideOut Music]]. The album was their first [[concept album]], dealing with the [[myth]] of [[Atlantis]]. The album features classics such as \"Evolution (The Grand Design)\", \"Communion and the Oracle\", \"Egypt\" and the mini-suite \"Rediscovery\", and includes pieces of classical music.\n\nThe band went on a European and South American tour shortly after its release and recorded their first live album, ''[[Live on the Edge of Forever]]''.\n\nIn 2002, the band released ''[[The Odyssey (album)|The Odyssey]]'', an album prominently featuring a 24-minute-long musical interpretation of the [[Homer]]ic [[Epic poetry|epic]], the [[Odyssey]].\n\nIn 2005 Symphony X was featured on [[Gigantour]], a summer festival headlined by [[Megadeth]] with [[Dream Theater]], [[Nevermore]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]].
