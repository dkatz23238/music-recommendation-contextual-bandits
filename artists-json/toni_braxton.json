She has sold over 70 million records worldwide and is one of the best-selling female artists in history. Braxton has won seven [[Grammy Awards]], nine [[Billboard Music Awards]], seven [[American Music Awards]], and numerous other accolades.

After attracting the attention of producers [[Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]] and [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds]] and being signed to [[LaFace Records]], Braxton released her [[Toni Braxton (album)|self-titled debut studio album]] in 1993. The album reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and sold 10 million copies worldwide. In addition, the singles \"[[Another Sad Love Song]]\" and \"[[Breathe Again]]\" became international successes. The album brought Braxton three [[Grammy Awards]], including the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]].\n\nBraxton experienced continued success with the albums ''[[Secrets (Toni Braxton album)|Secrets]]'' (1996), which included the U.S. #1 hit singles \"[[You're Makin' Me High]]/[[Let It Flow (song)|Let It Flow]]\" and \"[[Un-Break My Heart]]\"; and ''[[The Heat (Toni Braxton album)|The Heat]]'' (2000), which opened at #2 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and included the U.S. #2 hit single \"[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]\". Braxton's subsequent studio albums, ''[[More Than a Woman (album)|More Than a Woman]]'' (2002), ''[[Libra (Toni Braxton album)|Libra]]'' (2005) and ''[[Pulse (Toni Braxton album)|Pulse]]'' (2010), were released amid contractual disputes and health issues. In 2014, Braxton and longtime collaborator [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] released a duet album entitled ''[[Love, Marriage & Divorce]]'' that earned the duo a [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album]] in 2015. Further label changes saw the release of ''[[Sex & Cigarettes]]'' (2018) under [[Def Jam]]/[[Universal Music|Universal]] and ''[[Spell My Name]]'' (2020) under [[Island Records|Island]].\n\nBraxton is also a television executive producer and personality.
