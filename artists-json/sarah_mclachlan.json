One of the band's songs, \"Grind\", credited as a group composition, can be found on the independent Flamingo Records release ''Out of the Fog'' and the CD ''Out of the Fog Too''. It has yet to be released elsewhere.\n\nFollowing The October Game's first concert at [[Dalhousie University]] opening for [[Moev]], McLachlan was offered a recording contract with Vancouver-based independent record label [[Nettwerk]] by Moev's [[Mark Jowett]]. McLachlan's parents insisted that she finish high school and complete one year of studies at the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] before moving to Vancouver and embarking on a new life as a recording artist. She finally signed to Nettwerk two years later before having written a single song. When she was 19, a mutual acquaintance introduced her to her birth mother. McLachlan did not seek her out and was ambivalent about meeting her.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 1994, McLachlan was sued by Uwe Vandrei, an obsessed fan from [[Ottawa]], who alleged that his letters to her had been the basis of the single \"[[Possession (Sarah McLachlan song)|Possession]]\". The lawsuit was also challenging for the Canadian legal system since Vandrei was an admitted [[stalking|stalker]] whose acknowledged goal in filing the lawsuit was to be near McLachlan. Consequently, precautions were taken to ensure McLachlan's safety if she had to be in the same location as Vandrei. Before the trial began, however, Vandrei was found dead in an apparent [[suicide]]. Vandrei's preoccupation with McLachlan was explored at length in Canadian author [[Judith Fitzgerald]]'s book, ''Building a Mystery: The Story of Sarah McLachlan & Lilith Fair''.\n\nIn 1997, McLachlan married her drummer, [[Ashwin Sood]], in [[Jamaica]]. While she was pregnant with her first child, her mother died from [[cancer]] in December 2001. While working on her next album, ''[[Afterglow (Sarah McLachlan album)|Afterglow]]'', she gave birth to daughter India in Vancouver on April 6, 2002. On June 22, 2007, she gave birth to her second daughter, Taja, also in Vancouver. McLachlan announced her separation from Sood in September 2008<ref name=billboard /> and they divorced the same year.<ref name=\"usma_Sara\">{{Cite web | title = Sarah McLachlan Opens Up About \"Devastating\" Divorce | work = Us Weekly | date = 27 May 2011 | access-date = 2017-12-10 | url = https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sarah-mclachlan-opens-up-about-devastating-divorce-2011275/ }}</ref>\n\n==Career and albums==\n\n=== 1987\u201392: ''Touch'' and ''Solace'' ===\nThe signing with Nettwerk prompted McLachlan to move to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].

The album's singles included a new live version of her earlier song, \"I Will Remember You\", a studio recording of which had previously been released on ''[[The Brothers McMullen]]'' soundtrack as well as ''[[Rarities, B-Sides and Other Stuff]]''. The song was released as a single twice, once in 1995 where it peaked No. 65 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 10 in Canada, and again in 1999 at No. 14 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 10 in Canada.

Rather than shoot a conventional music video for \"World On Fire\", McLachlan donated all but $15 of the $150,000 budget to various charitable causes around the world and then used the video to explain how it benefited the communities that received the money. Like ''Surfacing'', the album reached number one in Canada and number two in the United States.\n\nAnother live album, ''[[Afterglow Live]]'', was released in late 2004. The CD consisted of several tracks from a full-length concert, which was included in its entirety on a DVD, as well as the three music videos from ''Afterglow''.\n\nIn 2004, [[Darryl McDaniels|Darryl \"D.M.C.\" McDaniels]], who credits McLachlan and her music for lifting him from a period of depression, as he described publicly on [[NPR]] [[The Moth|Moth Radio Hour]] \"Angel\" dated September 9, 2014, invited her to join him on a track from his solo album.

The show also featured a performance by the Sarah McLachlan Musical Outreach Choir & Percussion Ensemble, a children's choir and percussion band from the aforementioned Vancouver outreach program. Entitled ''One World: The Concert for Tsunami Relief'', the concert raised approximately $3.6 million for several Canadian aid agencies working in south and southeast Asia.\n\nOn July 2, 2005, McLachlan participated in the [[Live 8#Philadelphia, USA|Philadelphia installment]] of the [[Live 8]] concerts, where she performed her hit \"Angel\" with [[Josh Groban]]. These concerts, which were held simultaneously in nine major cities around the world, were intended to coincide with the [[G8 summit]] to put pressure on the leaders of the world's richest nations to fight poverty in Africa by cancelling debt.\n\nIn 2008, she donated a song to [[Aid Still Required]]'s CD to assist with the restoration of the devastation done to Southeast Asia from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]].\n\nOn November 30, 2012, McLachlan lent her support to [[Kate Winslet]]'s Golden Hat Foundation together with [[Tim Janis]], [[Loreena McKennitt]], [[Andrea Corr]], [[Hayley Westenra]], [[Sleepy Man Banjo Boys]], Dawn Kenney, [[Jana Mashonee]], Amy Petty and a choir etc. performing on \"The American Christmas Carol\" concert in [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Sarah-McLachlan-Andrea-Corr-and-More-Set-for-Tim-Janis-American-Christmas-Carol-Concert-1130-20120914 |title=American Christmas Carol Concert |publisher=broadwayworld.com |date=September 14, 2012 |access-date=December 2, 2012 |archive-date=November 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101014304/http://broadwayworld.com/article/Sarah-McLachlan-Andrea-Corr-and-More-Set-for-Tim-Janis-American-Christmas-Carol-Concert-1130-20120914 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenhatfoundation.org/about-us/blog |title=The American Christmas Carol |publisher=goldenhatfoundation.org |access-date=December 2, 2012}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=November 2021}}\n\nMcLachlan is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artistsagainstracism.org/radio-2/|title=Radio - Artists Against Racism|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Sarah McLachlan discography}}\n<!--For main studio albums only-->\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Fumbling Towards Ecstasy]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Surfacing (album)|Surfacing]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Afterglow (Sarah McLachlan album)|Afterglow]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Wintersong]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Laws of Illusion]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Shine On (Sarah McLachlan album)|Shine On]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Wonderland (Sarah McLachlan album)|Wonderland]]'' (2016)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"allmusicWintersong\">{{cite web  | title = Wintersong\u2014Credits  | work = [[AllMusic]]  | publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]]  | url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r857256/credits|pure_url=yes}}  | access-date =March 13, 2010\n}}</ref>\n<!--unused<ref name=\"gg\">{{cite news | title = Order of Canada\u2014Sarah McLachlan, O.C., O.B.C.  | newspaper = [[Governor General of Canada]] | publisher = Office of the Secretary to the Governor General | date = March 30, 2006  | url = http://www.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&TypeID=orc&id=6456  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20060515052830/http://omni.ac.uk/images/omntop.gif | archive-date = May 15, 2006| url-status = dead  | access-date =March 13, 2010\n}}</ref>-->\n<ref name=\"mommusic\">{{cite news  | title = Mom makes music  | newspaper = Canada.com  | publisher = [[Canwest]]  | date = September 30, 2008  | url = http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/arts/story.html?id=e8f5f589-b813-472a-aef1-9a38da2a8204  | access-date = March 13, 2010  | url-status = dead  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604120245/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/arts/story.html?id=e8f5f589-b813-472a-aef1-9a38da2a8204  | archive-date = June 4, 2011  | df = mdy-all  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite news  | title = New McLachlan Songs Evoke Personal Turmoil  | newspaper = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]  | publisher = Nielsen Business Media  | url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044126/new-mclachlan-songs-evoke-personal-turmoil  | access-date = March 13, 2010  | archive-date = January 11, 2014  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140111023149/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044126/new-mclachlan-songs-evoke-personal-turmoil  | url-status = live  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news  | last = Essex  | first = Andrew  | title = MUSIC; Forget the Movie.
