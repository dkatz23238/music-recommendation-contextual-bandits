Distributed in the US and [[United Kingdom|UK]] by [[Rough Trade Records]], the album was similar in style to the EP, veering from the Velvets-esque stomp of \"Wait\" to the noisy, dirty garage punk blues of \"Fuck the People\" and dark [[psychedelia]] of \"Kissy Kissy\". The record was well received by the music press, though the White Stripes comparisons would not go away.\n\nMosshart chain-smoked while singing, rarely speaking to the audience; at a [[New York City]] show following the ban on public smoking, Mosshart went on stage with three bottles of water, lit up a cigarette and proceeded to smoke constantly from the first song to the last note of the set. In 2004 Mosshart and Hince bought a house together in Dalston.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2005, \"Monkey 23\" was used in \"[[De battre mon c\u0153ur s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9]]\", where it played over the closing credits.

Featuring an artier, less \"''guitar rock''\" sound, the record embraced [[post punk]] influences and sounded even more stripped down than ''[[Keep on Your Mean Side]]''. Originally written to be performed on a [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]], the band was forced to change directions and record it primarily using a guitar after Hince's Moog broke and couldn't be repaired before entering the studio.<ref name=\"Do Or Die\">[http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?f_id=277] {{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> A 40-minute DVD documentary was included with a limited number of copies and features interview, performance and on the road footage shot on tour.

She also features on the [[Primal Scream]] album ''[[Riot City Blues]]''.\n\n''[[Midnight Boom]]'' was released in March 2008. Its music was used throughout many American TV shows, including ''90210''. A big selection of songs from the album were featured in the hit television series ''Gossip Girl'', and also, their track \"Sour Cherry\" was featured as the soundbed for Season Two's official trailer. \"Sour Cherry\" was also featured in the ''[[Footloose (2011 film)|Footloose]]'' trailer, as well as in the 2008 rom-com ''[[The House Bunny]]''. The album also picked up new mainstream success for the band with various TV performances in the UK; appearing on ''Later With Jools Holland'', ''Friday Night with Jonathan Ross'', ''T4'', ''The Album Chart Show'', ''Sound'', ''Live From Abbey Road'', and ''From The Basement''.\n\nOn October 21, 2008, \"Cheap and Cheerful\" was used on the show ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' during the opening scene of the episode \"[[Lucky Thirteen (House)|Lucky Thirteen]]\". \"Cheap and Cheerful\" can also be heard on the ''[[NHL 09]]'' soundtrack. It was later used in the [[Fendi]]'s TV commercial for the \"Fan di Fendi\" perfume (2010). \"U.R.A. Fever\" was played during a love scene in the 2010 movie ''[[The Losers (2010 film)|The Losers]]''.
