As of 2008, Ayria was continuing a full United States tour as the supporting act for [[The Cr\u00fcxshadows]].  She has played successful shows at DragonCon, alongside figures such as Sir Patrick Stewart, most recently in 2011, and has also performed with the seminal EBM/synthpop band [[VNV Nation]].<ref>[http://dragoncon.org/dc_guest_detail.php?id=2083 DragonCon Bio Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628184914/http://dragoncon.org/dc_guest_detail.php?id=2083 |date=June 28, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe first two songs by Ayria since the release of ''Flicker'' included \"The Gun Song\", featured on the compilation ''Alfa Matrix - Re:connected [2.0]'', released in August 2006 and \"Six Seconds On All Sides\" released on [[Dancing Ferret]]'s ''Asleep By Dawn'' compilation in fall of 2006.

It came in both a single CD, a two disc deluxe version and as a strictly limited pink [[Gramophone record|vinyl]]. The second CD is a spiritual sequel to the bonus disc ''Planet Parkin'' that came with her third album ''Hearts for Bullets'', titled ''The Heartless Kingdom''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alfamatrix.bandcamp.com/album/paper-dolls-bonus-tracks-version|title=Paper Dolls (Bonus Tracks Version), by AYRIA|website=Alfa Matrix}}</ref>\n\n==Touring members==\nAyria has performed with various band members for her live performances, which have included Mike Wimer, Eric Gottesman, Shaun Frandsen, Joe Byer (v01d), Cam Eleon, Justin Pogue, and Kevin Toole. For her North American tour with Project Pitchfork in 2013 Sarah Wimer joined the live group whereas in 2014 the live formation was completed by Michael Linke, who since then has played the keys beside of Sarah Wimer on various European shows of Ayria.\n\n== Discography ==\n\n===Albums===\n* ''[[Debris (Ayria album)|Debris]]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], November - 2003)\n* ''Flicker'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], October - 2005)\n* ''[[Hearts for Bullets]]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], September - 2008)\n* ''Plastic Makes Perfect'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], May - 2013)\n* ''Paper Dolls'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], April - 2016)\n* ''This Is My Battle Cry'' ([[Artoffact Records]], August - 2022)\n\n===EPs===\n* ''[[My Revenge on the World]]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], May - 2005)\n* ''[[The Gun Song (album)|The Gun Song]]''  ([[Alfa Matrix]], March - 2008)\n* ''Plastic and Broken EP''  ([[Alfa Matrix]], February - 2013)\n\n===Compilation albums===\n* ''Cyberl@b 4.0'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2003)\n* ''[[square matrix 004]]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2004)\n* ''ADVANCED CLUB 0.1''\n* ''Re:connected [1.0]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2004)\n* ''United Vol.I'' (NoiTekk, 2005)\n* ''[[Endzeit Bunkertracks#Endzeit Bunkertracks: Act I|Endzeit Bunkertracks: Act I]]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2005)\n* ''Cyberl@b 5.0'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2005)\n* ''Re:connected [2.0]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2006)\n* ''Fxxk the Mainstream [vol.1]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2007)\n* ''[[Endzeit Bunkertracks#Endzeit Bunkertracks: Act III|Endzeit Bunkertracks: Act III]]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2007)\n* Depeche Mode Tribute ''Alfa-Matrix Re:Covered'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2009)\n\n===Guest appearances===\n* track ''Fuck Things Up'' on ''Audio Blender'' by ''Implant'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2006)\n* track ''Into the Game'' on ''[[Eclectric (Psy'Aviah album)|Eclectric]]'' by ''[[Psy'Aviah]]'' ([[Alfa Matrix]], 2010)\n* track ''Give It to You'' by ''Corporate Soldiers'' (2010)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ayria.com/?p=5511|title=Listen to a new song!
