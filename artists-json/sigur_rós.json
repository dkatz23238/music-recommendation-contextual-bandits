However, not all Sigur R\u00f3s songs are in Vonlenska; many are sung in Icelandic.\n\nVonlenska differs from both natural and [[constructed language]]s used for human communication. It consists of strings of meaningless syllables containing [[Non-lexical vocables in music|non-lexical vocables]] and [[phoneme]]s. There is no grammatical relation between or among syllables, nor are they accompanied by clearly defined word boundaries. Vonlenska emphasizes the phonological and emotive qualities of human vocalizations, and it uses the melodic and rhythmic elements of singing without the conceptual content of language. In this way, it is similar to the use of [[scat singing]] in vocal [[jazz]] and [[puirt \u00e0 beul]] in traditional  [[Irish folk music]] and [[Scottish folk music|Scottish]]. The band's website describes it as \"a form of [[gibberish]] vocals that fits to the music\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/faq.php#07\n|title=Frequently asked questions\n|website=Sigur-ros.co.uk\n|access-date=15 May 2011\n}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
