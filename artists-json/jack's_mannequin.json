The band originally began as a solo project for [[Andrew McMahon]], the frontman of [[Something Corporate]].\n\nThe band was signed to Maverick Records and released ''[[Everything in Transit]]'' in August 2005, peaking at 37 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=jack's mannequin|chart=all}}|title=Music Charts, Most Popular Music, Music by Genre & Top Music Charts|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=2012-07-10}}</ref> ''[[The Glass Passenger]]'' was released in 2008 on [[Sire Records]], sold 49,000 copies in its first week, and peaked at number eight on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name=\"Bboard\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043841/ti-debuts-big-atop-billboard-200-hot-100|title=T.I.

Shortly afterward, it was announced that McMahon would discontinue releasing music under the name Jack's Mannequin, choosing to release music under his own name henceforth.\n\nOn November 30, 2015, McMahon announced that he would reunite Jack's Mannequin for a tenth-anniversary tour of ''[[Everything In Transit]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and ''Everything in Transit'' (2004\u201307)===\nAndrew McMahon began his musical career as the lead vocalist and pianist for the Orange County piano rock band [[Something Corporate]]. The primary impulse behind McMahon's solo project, Jack's Mannequin, was a song he recorded in December 2003 titled \"Locked Doors\". He felt the song had too different a style from previous Something Corporate material to be one of their songs. He realized that if he ever decided to release it, it would be on a solo album rather than a Something Corporate record.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Debele|first1=Gary|last2=Barber|first2=Nicole|url=http://soco-online.com/articles/jacksmannequin/index.htm|title=Interview with Andrew McMahon|work=SoCo-Online|access-date=July 31, 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620185034/http://soco-online.com/articles/jacksmannequin/index.htm|archive-date=June 20, 2007}}</ref> Exhausted from months of touring in late summer 2004, the band decided to take a temporary break. During his time off, McMahon laid down piano and vocal tracks for a song on [[Hidden in Plain View]]'s ''[[Life in Dreaming]]'' and two songs on [[Tommy Lee]]'s ''[[Tommyland: The Ride]]''.\n\nWhile Something Corporate's other songwriter and lead guitarist Josh Partington created a side project of his own called [[Firescape]], McMahon started writing his own songs. He did not expect the songs to be released. McMahon took a more therapeutic approach in writing these songs, resulting in a more personal and intimate testament of his songwriting. McMahon stated in an interview that they dealt with \"coming home, and having home be way different than I had remembered it [...], abandoning a lot of people, and things, that I had normally been so attached to [...], exploring and being okay with myself, and not having to make excuses for who I am, and accepting who I am.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Laura|url=http://www.forthesound.com/index.php?categoryid=54&p2007_articleid=4|title=Andrew Mcmahon|work=For The Sound|access-date=February 12, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527111421/http://www.forthesound.com/index.php?categoryid=54&p2007_articleid=4|archive-date=May 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although he just planned on recording these songs, they began to take shape collectively. He paid for the production out of his own pocket, which ultimately led to a record deal with Maverick Records.\n\nHe formed the band under the name Jack's Mannequin, which came to be after McMahon had considered the name \"The Mannequins\". However, after growing \"bored of 'the' band names,\" he decided to sandwich it together with the title of a song he had completed for the record, \"Dear Jack\". Originally, there was said to be \"not much significance behind the name,\" but upon McMahon's diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, \"the band name became ironic--considering the Jack I wrote the song for & ultimately named the project after, suffered from childhood leukemia.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Herbel|first=Brandon|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=84442|title=Jacks Mannequin (Andrew McMahon) \u2013 08.29.05|website=[[AbsolutePunk]]|access-date=2009-11-08}}</ref>\n\nTheir first album, titled ''[[Everything in Transit]]'', was released in August 2005 and received a positive response from fans and critics alike.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rohan|first=Kohli|title=Jack's Mannequin - Everything in Transit|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=97426|work=Album Reviews|publisher=AbsolutePunk|access-date=27 April 2011}}</ref>  A summer tour was scheduled to support the record release, but was canceled after McMahon was diagnosed with [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] and received a [[stem cell transplant]] from his sister Kate.<ref>{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Moss|title=Something Corporate Singer In Remission After Stem-Cell Transplant|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1511627/something-corporate-singer-cancerfree.jhtml?headlines=true|access-date=27 April 2011|newspaper=MTV News|date=2005-10-18}}</ref>\n\nMusic by Jack's Mannequin from ''Everything in Transit'' was featured in Season Three, Episode Fifteen of the TV series ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=One Tree Hill Web|title=One Tree Hill Music|url=http://www.oth-music.com/episode315.html|publisher=Obe Tree Hill Web|access-date=27 April 2011}}</ref> Hilarie Burton's character on the show, [[Peyton Sawyer]], appeared in the music video for 'The Mixed Tape,' from [[Everything In Transit]].\n\nIn May 2013, nearly eight years after its 2005 release, the track Dark Blue went gold.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Jack's Mannequin's \"Dark Blue\" Goes Gold|url = http://propertyofzack.com/post/49821683725/jacks-mannequins-dark-blue-goes-gold|website = propertyofzack.com|access-date = 2016-01-30}}</ref> In August 2021, 16 years after its 2005 release, Everything In Transit went gold. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Gold & Platinum|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|access-date=2021-09-06|website=RIAA|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===''The Glass Passenger'' (2007\u20132009)===\n[[File:jack'smannequingrogshop.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Jack's Mannequin performing at The Grog Shop in Cleveland, Ohio, November 10, 2008.]]\nThe band began recording their second album in the summer of 2007.

The tour was called \"Hammers and Strings: An Evening with Jack's Mannequin and The Glass Passenger.\" The band toured many cities and played much of the album at these shows. This much-awaited tour saw many of the shows sell out in a few days. It was the first tour after ''The Glass Passenger'''s release.\n\nOn October 4, 2009, McMahon began a solo tour across the country to raise awareness of leukemia and to support the release of the ''Dear Jack'' documentary due out on November 3, 2009. On November 3, 2009, the EP associated with the ''Dear Jack'' documentary, also of the same name, was released, including the songs \"Dear Jack\", \"Diane, the Skyscraper\", \"There, There Katie\", and \"Swim (Music Box)\".\n\n===''People and Things'' (2010\u20132011)===\nOn September 28, 2010, it was announced bassist Jonathan \u201cDr. J\u201d Sullivan left the band to pursue his other band, Kid Is Qual.

My goal with many of the songs was to strip away the flowery language and sentiment attached to newer love and replace it with starker, less blinded language about more binding love. In the time following the last Jack's album the people in my world were moving in together, getting married, trying to find quote unquote 'real jobs' and reconciling new lives that looked a lot less like youth than some of us cared for. Marriage is a bit of a beast to tackle in a pop record but when I wrote 'My Racing Thoughts,' it became clear how powerful and loaded a subject this kind of love is and somewhere in that moment I began to lock into the broad concept for the writing sessions to come.\" In another (unrelated) interview, McMahon established \"this album should be different than the previous few. The first (''Everything In Transit'') was about breaking up, the second (''The Glass Passenger'') was about getting sick and recovering from it. I hated that album at first, until we wrote this one (''People and Things'') and I then realized how proud I am of all of my work. This album will be much more 'cheery' than the last one(s).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2366302 |title=Jacks Mannequin Release Date for \"People and Things\" - News Article |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=2012-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===Retirement of name (2012\u20132013)===\nOn February 2, 2012, McMahon foreshadowed the end to the band, saying, \u201cI foresee an end to the usage of the name. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s doing for me what it used to, in the sense that Jack\u2019s sort of really represented a freedom from something.
