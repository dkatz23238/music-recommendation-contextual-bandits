Formed in 1998, the band is composed of lead singer and songwriter [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond, Jr.|Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. They were a leading group of the early-2000s [[indie rock]] revival.\n\nThe release of their EP ''[[The Modern Age]]'' in early 2001 sparked a [[bidding war]] among major labels, with the band eventually signing to [[RCA Records]]. That summer, they released their debut album, ''[[Is This It]]'', to critical acclaim and strong sales. It has since appeared on numerous \"best album\" lists. It was followed by ''[[Room on Fire]]'' (2003) and ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' (2005), both of which sold well but failed to match ''Is This It'' in critical success.\n\nFollowing a five-year hiatus, they released ''[[Angles (The Strokes album)|Angles]]'' (2011) and ''[[Comedown Machine]]'' (2013) to lukewarm critical reception and dwindling sales. Following the end of their initial contract with RCA, they released the ''[[Future Present Past]]'' EP (2016) through Casablancas' label [[Cult Records|Cult]]. The band were relatively inactive throughout the decade, making infrequent live appearances and directing most media attention to individual projects.\n\nIn 2020, they released their first studio album in seven years, ''[[The New Abnormal]]'', produced by [[Rick Rubin]] and released through Cult and RCA. Critics considered the album a return to form. It went on to win [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/the-strokes-win-best-rock-album-at-2021-grammys/|title=The Strokes Win Best Rock Album at 2021 Grammys|author=Madison Bloom|publisher=Pitchfork|date=March 14, 2021|access-date=2021-03-14}}</ref> As of 2020, the band has sold 5 million albums worldwide.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and ''The Modern Age'' EP (1998\u20132001)===\n{{See also|The Modern Age}}\nLead singer-songwriter [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarist [[Nick Valensi]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]] started playing together as teenagers while attending [[Dwight School]] in Manhattan, and formed an informal band in 1997.

Most of these songs now feature different lyrics. The band connected with producer [[Gordon Raphael]] in 2000 following a show at Luna Lounge and made a demo, [[The Modern Age|''The Modern Age'' EP]], with him. The band sent the demo to the newly reformed [[Rough Trade Records]] in the UK, sparking interest there, and leading to their first release (via the website of the UK magazine, ''[[NME]],'' who gave away a free MP3 download of \"[[Last Nite]]\" a week prior to the physical release as part of ''The Modern Age'' EP in 2001). The EP sparked a bidding war among record labels, the largest for a rock band in years.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=4690|title=the Strokes: \"We Just Do Our Own Thing\"|access-date=January 23, 2007|year=2001|author=Joe D'Angelo|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211070125/http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=4690|archive-date=February 11, 2007}}</ref> In August 2001, the Strokes made their first appearance on the cover of the publication ''[[The Fader]]'' in its ninth issue.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | title = Fader 50: New York Rock\n  | magazine = The Fader\n  | date = November 26, 2007\n  | url = http://www.thefader.com/2007/11/26/fader-50-new-york-rock/\n  | access-date=November 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===''Is This It''  (2001\u20132002) ===\n{{Main|Is This It}}\n[[File:The Strokes by Roger Woolman.jpg|thumb|right|The Strokes in 2002]]\nThe Strokes released their debut album, ''[[Is This It]],'' in the US in October 2001.

[[RCA]] delayed the North American (US) release over concerns with the album's cover and lyrics.

RCA replaced the track \"New York City Cops\" with \"When It Started\", as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. The track \"New York City Cops\"\u2014featuring the refrain, \"New York City Cops, they ain't too smart\"\u2014was listed as No. 12 on ''New York'' magazine's \"Ultimate New York Playlist\" on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), ''Is This It'' received critical acclaim\u2014among other accolades, four stars from ''Rolling Stone'', and a 9.1 from [[Pitchfork Media]]. The album made many critics' top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by ''Entertainment Weekly'' and ''Time'', and (in an article previewing summer concerts) ''[[NME]]'' urged readers to attend the Strokes' shows\u2014as they were touring some of the \"best pop songs ever\". While critics noted the influence of [[CBGB]] stalwarts [[Television (band)|Television]], Casablancas and bandmates said they had never heard the band, instead citing [[the Velvet Underground]] as a reference point.\n\nAfter the release of ''Is This It'', the band toured around the world\u2014including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and North America (the band opened for the [[Rolling Stones]] on numerous occasions during the North American leg of their tour). The self-made mini-documentary \"In Transit\" was filmed during the summer tour of Europe. In August 2002, the band headlined the UK's [[Carling Weekend]] festivals for the second time, subsequently playing at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]] on a bill with [[the White Stripes]]. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] joined the Strokes on stage to perform the guitar solo on \"New York City Cops\". During that period, the band also appeared as musical guests on numerous late-night talk shows. ''Is This It'' yielded several singles and music videos, all of which were directed by [[Roman Coppola]].\n\n''Is This It'' has had an enduring impact on fans and critics alike.

They also made the cover of ''Rolling Stone'' for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress [[Drew Barrymore]], which ended in January 2007. The first single taken from ''Room on Fire'' was the song \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi's guitar. The video was also directed by Roman Coppola, and was inspired by the futuristic look of the 1980s film ''[[Tron]]''. This consisted of a mainly black scene, with instances of glowing picton blue and riptide.\n\nIn November 2003, the Strokes played on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', performing \"[[Reptilia (song)|Reptilia]]\", \"What Ever Happened\", \"Under Control\" and \"I Can't Win\".<ref>DeRogatis, J.

While on tour, Spektor and the Strokes recorded the song \"[[Modern Girls & Old Fashion Men]]\", released as a B-side on the \"Reptilia\" single. Also during the tour, the band included [[the Clash]]'s \"Clampdown\" as a cover, which was released as the B-side for \"[[The End Has No End]]\".\n\nIn late 2004, the Strokes revealed plans to release a live album. The ''Live in London'' LP was planned for release in October 2004, but was abandoned, reportedly due to recording quality problems. The chosen gig was one held at the legendary [[Alexandra Palace]] in North London.\n\n=== ''First Impressions of Earth'' and hiatus (2005\u20132007) ===\n{{Main|First Impressions of Earth}}\n[[File:The Strokes in concert.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Strokes in concert, 2006]]\nIn late September 2005, \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\", the first single from the Strokes' then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. \"Juicebox\" became the Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world. Their third album, ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'', was released on December 30, 2005, in Germany<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.laut.de/The-Strokes/Alben/First-Impressions-Of-Earth-11120 |title=\"First Impressions of Earth\" von The Strokes |last=Butscher |first=Vicky |website=[[Laut.de]] |language=de |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> and January 3, 2006, elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/first-impressions-of-earth-mw0000339306 |title=First Impressions of Earth - The Strokes |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> It received mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the U.S. and number one in the UK, the latter being a first for the band. In Japan, it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' playing \"Juicebox\" and \"[[You Only Live Once (song)|You Only Live Once]]\". The album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne.<ref>Marchese, D. (January 2006).

The second single off ''First Impressions of Earth'', \"Heart in a Cage\", was released in March 2006.

An e-mail was sent out soon afterwards by Strokes manager [[Ryan Gentles]], confirming that \"much needed break\". A new band website went online in May 2007 along with the release of an alternate video to their single \"You Only Live Once\" directed by [[Warren Fu]]. The video also featured a brief interlude with \"Ize of the World\", also from ''First Impressions of Earth''. The song \"You Talk Way Too Much\" was used in a commercial for the Ford Sync.
