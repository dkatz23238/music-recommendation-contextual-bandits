She will be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in November 2022.\n\nHer 1979 debut album, ''[[In the Heat of the Night (Pat Benatar album)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', was her breakthrough in North America, especially in Canada where it reached No. 3 on the album chart. Two singles from it were hits: \"[[Heartbreaker (Pat Benatar song)|Heartbreaker]]\" and \"We Live for Love\", the latter written by her lead guitarist and future husband, [[Neil Giraldo]]. Her second album, 1980's ''[[Crimes of Passion (Pat Benatar album)|Crimes of Passion]]'', was her most successful work, peaking at No. 2 in North America and France, being certified 4\u00d7 and 5\u00d7 platinum in the US and Canada, respectively. Its single \"[[Hit Me with Your Best Shot]]\" reached the top 10 in the US and Canada and is considered to be her best-known song. Her third album, ''[[Precious Time (album)|Precious Time]]'' (1981), was another success, topping the US Album Chart and becoming her first top 10 album in Australia. Its single \"[[Fire and Ice (Pat Benatar song)|Fire and Ice]]\" charted highly in the US and Canada. Her next release, ''[[Get Nervous]]'' (1982), sold less well than her previous two albums, but did include the North American hit \"[[Shadows of the Night]]\".\n\nHer sound began to move towards more atmospheric pop in 1983. The single \"[[Love Is a Battlefield]]\" (1983) written by Holly Knight and Mike Chapman was her biggest hit in most countries, reaching No. 1 in the Netherlands, Australia and on the US Rock Tracks chart, and No. 5 on the US Hot 100. The live album it came from ''[[Live from Earth]]'', was her biggest seller in Australia, Germany and the Netherlands. In 1984, she released ''[[Tropico (Pat Benatar album)|Tropico]]'' and its lead single \"[[We Belong]]\", which reached the top 10 in several countries, including No. 5 on the US Hot 100.\n\nHer 1985 album, ''[[Seven the Hard Way]]'', sold less well but it yielded two singles harking back to the rock vein: \"[[Invincible (Pat Benatar song)|Invincible]]\", written by Holly Knight and Simon Climie, a top 10 hit in North America, and \"[[Sex as a Weapon]]\". Her follow-up, ''[[Wide Awake in Dreamland]]'' (1988), marked a resurgence in sales in Canada and Australia, and was her biggest hit in the UK. Its rocker, \"[[All Fired Up (Pat Benatar song)|All Fired Up]]\", was a significant hit in Canada, Australia and the US.

The album was another success, reaching number 4 in the US, although it sold less well in most other countries, generally only reaching the Top 20 (Canada number 16), and only reached number 73 in the UK. It was her fourth consecutive RIAA and CRIA Platinum certification, and \"Shadows of the Night\" garnered Benatar her third Grammy, again for \"Best Female Rock Vocal Performance\". The follow-up singles, \"Little Too Late\" and \"Looking for a Stranger\", were also successful in the US, hitting number 20 and number 39 (plus number 4 on the Rock Tracks chart) but did not chart outside the US, even in Canada. The [[World War II|WWII-themed]] music video for \"Shadows of the Night\" featured then-unknown actors [[Judge Reinhold]] as an American fighter copilot and [[Bill Paxton]] as a German radio operator.\n\nBy 1983 she had established a reputation for singing about \"tough\" subject matters, best exemplified by one of the biggest hits of her career, \"[[Love Is a Battlefield]]\" (penned by noted hit songwriter [[Holly Knight]] with [[Mike Chapman]]), released in December 1983. By then, her sound had mellowed from hard rock to more atmospheric pop and the story-based video clip for \"Love Is a Battlefield\" was aimed squarely at MTV, even featuring Benatar in a [[Michael Jackson]]-inspired group dance number, using Jackson's [[Beat It]] director [[Bob Giraldi]] and choreographer [[Michael Peters (choreographer)|Michael Peters]]. This new pop/rock direction was a huge commercial success, with the single remaining today as her biggest hit in most countries. This included it peaking at number 5 on the US Hot 100, number 1 for four weeks on the US Rock Tracks chart, number 2 in Canada, number 1 in the Netherlands (for four weeks ending as the number 2 song for the year), her first Top 30 hit there, and at number 1 in Australia for seven consecutive weeks, her first Top 25 hit there, number 3 in West Germany, number 5 in Switzerland, number 6 in New Zealand, and number 17 in the UK, her first Top 50 song there. It was became her first song to chart in Switzerland reaching number 11 there. The song also netted Benatar her fourth consecutive Grammy Award for \"Best Female Rock Vocal Performance\".\n\n\"Love Is a Battlefield\" was one of two studio tracks included on the live album, ''[[Live from Earth]]'', which was recorded during her sold-out 'Get Nervous' world tour of America and Europe in 1982 and 1983, the other being \"Lipstick Lies\". The album had mixed success in different countries: it peaked at number 2 in Australia, number 12 in New Zealand, number 13 in the US, and became her first hit album in Germany (number 7) and the Netherlands (number 4), but only made the Top 25 in Canada and France, and number 60 in the UK.

The single \"[[We Belong]]\", a slow-tempo pop song, released in October 1984, a month prior to the album's release, became another top 10 hit in the US peaking at number 5, reaching the Top 10 in several other countries, including number 7 in Australia, number 9 in West Germany, and number 5 in Switzerland, her most successful but last hit single there.

She and Giraldo said that this album is the first where they moved away from her famed \"hard rock\" sound and start experimenting with new, sometimes \"gentler\", styles and sounds. Despite not making the US Top 10, the album immediately earned her a sixth consecutive RIAA and CRIA Platinum-certified album.\n\nAfter the chart success of \"We Belong\" in the UK, \"Love is a Battlefield\" was re-released in the UK early 1985 and became her highest chart hit there, reaching number 17. \"We Belong\" was also nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1986, her first nomination in that category.\n\nIn 1985, she released her sixth studio album, ''[[Seven the Hard Way]]''. She hit the US Top 10 (and number 4 on the US Rock Tracks chart) with the Grammy-nominated rock single \"[[Invincible (Pat Benatar song)|Invincible]]\" (the theme from the movie ''[[The Legend of Billie Jean]]''), which was written by [[Holly Knight]] (Love Is a Battlefield) and [[Simon Climie]], three full months before the album was released. The track also reached number 6 in Canada. Her other Grammy-nominated single from the album, the guitar-driven \"Sex As a Weapon\", climbed as high as number 28 on the US Hot 100 in January 1986, number 5 on the US Rock Tracks chart, and reached the Top 30 in Canada. Both the ''Seven and the Hard Way'' singles were less successful outside North America than the previous two \"gentler\" singles, generally reaching the Top 30 in Australia, West Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand (although ''Invincible'' went Top 15 there), but missing the Top 50 in the UK. A third single, the mellow \"Le Bel Age\", made it to number 54 on the US Hot 100.\n\n''[[Seven the Hard Way]]'' peaked at number 26 in the US, earning an RIAA Gold certification (import CD). In Canada, it was her seventh consecutive Platinum certified album even though it only peaked at number 36 on the albums sales chart. It also reached number 19 in Australia and was a big success in New Zealand reaching number 2, but did not reach the Top 50 in West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland or the UK, and for the first time, an album of hers failed to chart in France.
