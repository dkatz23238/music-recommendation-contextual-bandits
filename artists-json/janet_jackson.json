She is noted for her innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows. Her sound and choreography became a catalyst in the growth of [[MTV]], enabling her to rise to prominence while breaking [[Gender inequality in the United States|gender]] and [[Racism against Black Americans|racial]] barriers in the process. Lyrical content which focused on social issues and lived experiences set her reputation as a role model for youth.\n\nThe tenth and youngest child of the [[Jackson family]], she began performing at the [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand]]. She starred in the [[variety show|variety]] television series ''[[The Jacksons (TV series)|The Jacksons]]'' and from 1977 went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including ''[[Good Times]]'', ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', and ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]''. After signing a recording contract with [[A&M Records]] in 1982, she became a [[pop icon]] following the release of her third and fourth studio albums ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' (1986) and ''[[Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814|Rhythm Nation 1814]]'' (1989). Her collaborations with record producers [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] incorporated elements of [[rhythm and blues]], [[funk]], [[disco]], [[rapping|rap]], and [[industrial music|industrial]] beats, which led to crossover success in [[popular music]].\n\nIn 1991, Jackson signed the first of two record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts with [[Virgin Records]], establishing her as one of the highest-paid artists in the industry. Prior to her first studio project with Virgin, she appeared in her first of several lead film roles in ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'' (1993). Her two studio albums which followed, ''[[Janet (album)|Janet]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' (1997), saw her develop a public image as a [[sex symbol]]. These records, along with their promotional music videos and live performances in concert tours, branded Jackson as one of the world's most erotic performers, garnering both criticism and praise. By the end of the 1990s, she was named by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine as the second most successful recording artist of the decade in the United States after [[Mariah Carey]]. The release of her seventh studio album ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]'' in 2001 coincided with a celebration of her impact on the recording industry as the subject of the inaugural ''[[MTV Icon]]'' special.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Biakolo|first=Kovie|date=April 24, 2021|title=Janet Jackson's All for You Was a Reawakening|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/janet-jackson-all-for-you-album-appreciation.html|access-date=May 4, 2021|website=Vulture|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nThe backlash from the 2004 [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]] resulted in an industry [[blacklisting]] under the direction of [[Les Moonves]], then-CEO of [[CBS Corporation]]. Jackson subsequently experienced reduced radio airplay, televised promotion and sales figures from that point forward. After parting ways with Virgin Records, she released her tenth studio album ''[[Discipline (Janet Jackson album)|Discipline]]'' (2008), her first and only album with [[Island Records]]. In 2015, she partnered with [[BMG Rights Management]] to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation and released her eleventh studio album ''[[Unbreakable (Janet Jackson album)|Unbreakable]]'' the same year. Since then she has continued to release music as an independent artist.\n\nJackson has sold over 100 million records,<!-- Do NOT change the figure without consensus --><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vibe.com/2020/04/janet-jackson-biopic-reportedly-in-development|title=Janet Jackson Biopic Reportedly In Development|author=Vibe Staff|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=April 29, 2020|access-date=January 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/12/lifestyle/janet-jackson-brings-black-diamond-tour-td-garden-this-summer/|title=Janet Jackson brings Black Diamond tour to TD Garden this summer|first=Diti|last=Kohli|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=February 12, 2020|access-date=January 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190623-why-janet-jackson-is-pops-most-underrated-legend|title=Culture \u2013 Why Janet Jackson is pop's most underrated legend|first=Nick|last=Levine|work=[[BBC]]|date=June 24, 2019|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref> making her one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]].
