Their line-up comprised singer [[Morrissey]], guitarist [[Johnny Marr]], bassist [[Andy Rourke]] and drummer [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]]. They are regarded as one of the most important acts to emerge from the British [[independent music]] scene of the 1980s.\n\nThe Smiths signed to the independent label [[Rough Trade Records]] and released their first album, ''[[The Smiths (album)|The Smiths]]'', in 1984. The Smiths based their songs on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr.  The band\u2019s focus on a guitar, bass, and drum sound and a fusion of 1960s rock and [[post-punk]] was a rejection of the [[synth-pop]] sound that was predominant at the time. Several Smiths singles reached the top 20 of the [[UK Singles Chart]], and all their studio albums reached the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]], including the number-one album ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'' (1985). They achieved mainstream success in Europe with ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'' (1986) and ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come]]'' (1987), both of which entered the top 20 of the [[European Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=European Hot 100 Albums Chart|magazine=Music & Media|date=26 July 1986|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1986/M&M-1986-07-26.pdf|access-date=14 Oct 2019|page=26|archive-date=10 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210110024750/https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1986/M&M-1986-07-26.pdf|url-status=live}}<br />{{cite magazine|title=European Hot 100 Albums Chart|magazine=Music & Media|date=31 October 1987|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1987/M&M-1987-10-31.pdf|access-date=14 Oct 2019|page=26|archive-date=10 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210110024751/https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1987/M&M-1987-10-31.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nInternal tensions led to their breakup in 1987, followed by public lawsuits over royalties.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> Their live album ''[[Rank (album)|Rank]]'' (1988) reached the top 10 in Europe.<ref name=\"rank\">{{cite magazine|title=European Hot 100 Albums Chart|magazine=Music & Media|date=24 September 1988|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1988/M&M-1988-09-24.pdf|access-date=14 Oct 2019|page=26|archive-date=10 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210110024751/https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1988/M&M-1988-09-24.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the band's dissolution, the members have refused offers to reunite and have all separately stated that the band is finished and will never reunite.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dunworth |first1=Liberty |title=JOHNNY MARR REFUTES ANY POSSIBILITIES OF WORKING ALONGSIDE MORRISSEY AGAIN: \u201cI\u2019LL JUST CARRY ON BEING WHO I AM\u201d |url=https://guitar.com/news/music-news/johnny-marr-refutes-working-alongside-morrissey-again/ |access-date=10 June 2022 |publisher=Guitar |date=1 March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=OPEN LETTER TO JOHNNY MARR |url=https://www.morrisseycentral.com/messagesfrommorrissey/open-letter-to-johnny-marr |website=Morrisseycentral |access-date=10 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Snapes |first1=Laura |title=Johnny Marr scotches Smiths reunion rumours: 'Nigel Farage on guitar' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/07/johnny-marr-morriseey-smiths-reunion-rumours-nigel-farage-on-guitar |website=Theguardian |access-date=10 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Morrissey: Smiths Turned Down Millions To Reunite |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/morrissey-smiths-turned-down-millions-to-reunite-59064/ |website=Billboard |access-date=10 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bonner |first1=Michael |title=Johnny Marr and Mike Joyce deny Smiths reunion reports |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/news/johnny-marr-and-mike-joyce-deny-smiths-reunion-reports-37442/ |access-date=10 June 2022 |publisher=Uncut}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===1982: Formation and early performances===\n[[File:The Smiths Logo.svg|thumb|The Smiths logo]]\nIn May 1982, [[Johnny Marr]] and his friend Steve Pomfret went to the home of [[Steven Morrissey]] in [[Stretford]] to invite him to form a band.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author=Simon Goddard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImK_BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT16|title=Songs That Saved Your Life|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=9781781162590|page=16|access-date=27 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210110024753/https://books.google.com/books?id=ImK_BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT16|archive-date=10 January 2021|url-status=live}}</ref> Marr and Morrissey had met at a [[Patti Smith]] gig at Manchester's [[O2 Apollo Manchester|Apollo Theatre]] on 31 August 1978, when Marr was 14 and Morrissey was 19.<ref name=\":0\" /> They bonded through their love of poetry and literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=32|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=16\u201317}} A fan of the [[New York Dolls]], Marr had been impressed that Morrissey had authored a book on the band and was inspired to turn up on his doorstep following the example of [[Jerry Leiber]], who had formed his working partnership with [[Mike Stoller]] after turning up at Stoller's door.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=32|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=16}} According to Morrissey: \"We got on absolutely famously.

The third track that the duo worked on was \"[[Suffer Little Children]]\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=18}} Alongside these original compositions, Morrissey suggested that the band produce a cover of \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\", a song by the 1960s American girl band [[the Cookies]]; although he had never heard of the song before, Marr agreed, enjoying the subversive element of having a male vocalist sing it, and the song was recorded on his TEAC machine.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=22}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"It's still really clear.

This caused an uproar after the grandfather of one of the murdered children heard the song on a [[Public house|pub]] [[jukebox]] and felt the band was trying to commercialise the murders. After meeting with Morrissey, he accepted that the song was a sincere exploration of the impact of the murders. Morrissey subsequently established a friendship with Ann West, the mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, who is mentioned by name in the song.<ref>See the discussion of [http://foreverill.com/disc/heaven.htm \"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926031909/http://foreverill.com/disc/heaven.htm |date=26 September 2008 }} at ''Forever Ill''; and the [http://www.passionsjustlikemine.com/lyrics/smiths-slc.htm \"Suffer Little Children\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206003624/http://passionsjustlikemine.com/lyrics/smiths-slc.htm |date=6 February 2012 }} lyrics at ''Passions Just Like Mine''.

It was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the group from being photographed eating meat), the light-hearted [[republicanism]] of \"Nowhere Fast\", and the anti-[[corporal punishment]] \"The Headmaster Ritual\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The band had also grown more diverse musically, with Marr adding rockabilly riffs to \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and Rourke playing a funk bass solo on \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The album was preceded by the re-release of the B-side \"[[How Soon Is Now?]]\" as a single, and although that song was not on the original [[Phonograph record|LP]], it has been added to subsequent releases.

Morrissey's lyrics, while superficially depressing, were often full of mordant humour; John Peel remarked that the Smiths were one of the few bands capable of making him laugh out loud. Influenced by his childhood interest in the [[social realism]] of 1960s [[kitchen sink realism|\"kitchen sink\"]] television plays, Morrissey wrote about ordinary people and their experiences with despair, rejection and death. While \"songs such as 'Still Ill' sealed his role as spokesman for disaffected youth\", Morrissey's \"manic-depressive rants\" and his \"'woe-is-me' posture inspired some hostile critics to dismiss the Smiths as 'miserabilists.'\"<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>\n\n==Visual imagery==\nThe group's cover artwork had a distinctive visual style and often featured images of film and pop stars, usually in [[duotone]]. Design was by Morrissey and Rough Trade art coordinator Jo Slee. The covers of singles rarely featured any text other than the band name and the band itself did not appear on the cover of any UK release. (Morrissey did, however, appear on an alternative cover for \"What Difference Does It Make?\", mimicking the pose of the original subject, actor [[Terence Stamp]], after the latter objected to his picture being used.) The choice of cover subjects reflected Morrissey's interest in film stars (Stamp, [[Alain Delon]], [[Jean Marais]], [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]] prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[James Dean]]); figures from sixties British popular culture ([[Viv Nicholson]], [[Pat Phoenix]], [[Yootha Joyce]], [[Shelagh Delaney]]); and anonymous images from old films and magazines.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/under_the_covers/the-smiths.htm| title = The Smiths.

In 1986, when the Smiths performed on the British music programme ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', Morrissey wore a fake hearing-aid to support a hearing-impaired fan who was ashamed of using one,<ref>Johnny Rogan, ''Morrissey and Marr: The Severed Alliance'' (London: Omnibus, 1992).</ref> and also frequently wore thick-rimmed [[National Health Service]]-style glasses.

The singer was a true original, delivering a blend of sensitivity and strength, defiance and tenderness, via a regionally inflected voice.
