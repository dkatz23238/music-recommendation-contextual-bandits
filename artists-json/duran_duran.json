A heavily edited form played in rotation on MTV. The band's breakthrough sophomore album was ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'' (1982), which peaked at number six in the US, number two in the United Kingdom, and number one in Australia and Canada. The songs \"[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]\" and \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\" featured cinematic music videos directed by Australian film maker [[Russel Mulcahy]] and became two of their biggest hits. \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" won the inaugural [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video]] in 1984. Their follow-up third album, ''[[Seven and the Ragged Tiger]],'' became their only UK number one album and featured the US and UK number one single \"[[The Reflex]]\". In 1985, the band topped the US charts with the single \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\" from the soundtrack of the [[A View to a Kill|film of the same name]].  \n\nAndy and Roger left the band before the recording of their fourth album, ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]'' (1986), which yielded the top ten [[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|title track]]. The band spent the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s continuing to release albums and singles, to only moderate success. Their comeback album, 1993's ''[[Duran Duran (1993 album)|Duran Duran]]'' (commonly called ''The Wedding Album'') featured two top-ten worldwide hits \"[[Ordinary World (song)|Ordinary World]]\" and \"[[Come Undone (Duran Duran song)|Come Undone]]\".  After John Taylor left in 1997, the band released a number of albums and singles which underperformed on the sales charts.  A full reunion of the original lineup of Le Bon, Rhodes, and all three Taylors in 2001 led to a number of highly successful concert tours and the 2004 album ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'', which reached number 3 in the UK and top 40 in numerous other countries.  The album's lead single \"[[(Reach Up for The) Sunrise]]\" was an international dance hit, and reached number five in the UK. Andy left again in 2006, and the band has released four additional albums, with the most recent being ''[[Future Past (Duran Duran album)|Future Past]]'' in 2021.\n\nDuran Duran has sold over 100 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=26 October 2016|title=Duran Duran to Get ASCAP Golden Note Award at London's ASCAP Awards|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7556897/duran-duran-ascap-awards-golden-note-award-london|magazine=Billboard|access-date=3 November 2016|archive-date=5 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105015728/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7556897/duran-duran-ascap-awards-golden-note-award-london|url-status=live}}</ref> They achieved 30 top 40 singles in the [[UK Singles Chart]]  (14 of them top 10) and 21 top 40 singles in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Naming their band after \"Dr. Durand Durand\", [[Milo O'Shea]]'s character from the sci-fi film ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella (1968)]]'', the three of them (Taylor on guitar and vocals, Rhodes on synthesizer and tapes, Duffy on vocals and bass) played their first gig on 5 April 1979 at the [[Birmingham Polytechnic]]. They were then joined by Simon Colley on clarinet and bass. John (then Nigel) Taylor was the guitarist at this point. After a few gigs, including a performance at [[Barbarella's]] in Birmingham opening for the band [[Fashion (band)|Fashion]] (with [[Roger Taylor (Duran Duran drummer)|Roger Taylor]] in the audience) Duffy and Colley left the band in June 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://durancompilations.com/early1.html |title=Duran Duran \u2013 The Early Days Chapter 1 |publisher=durancompilations.com |access-date=26 May 2022 }}</ref>\n\nTaylor and Rhodes then recruited singer Andy Wickett (formerly frontman of ''TV Eye'') and decided that they needed a live drummer. [[Roger Taylor (Duran Duran drummer)|Roger Taylor]] who had previously been in a few local bands (most recently ''The Scent Organs'' who also played at Barbarella's) came on board, while John Taylor switched to bass guitar. In September 1979 this incarnation of the band recorded a four-track demo including an early version of \"[[Girls on Film]]\" co-written by Andy Wickett. Soon afterwards Alan Curtis was recruited as lead guitarist. After a few gigs with this line-up Wickett left the band in late 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://durancompilations.com/early2.html |title=Duran Duran \u2013 The Early Days Chapter 2|publisher=durancompilations.com |access-date=26 May 2022 }}</ref>\n\nWickett was replaced by Roger Taylor's friend and former singer of ''The Scent Organs'' Jeff Thomas. In early 1980 they became the resident band at the city's [[Rum Runner (nightclub)|Rum Runner]] nightclub. They were doing jobs at the club, and began rehearsing and regularly playing at the venue. Curtis was however unhappy with the Rum Runner club scene and left the band to form [[Dif Juz]] with his brother. Soon afterwards Jeff Thomas was ousted from the band after disagreements and repeated arguments and the remaining three members started to look for a new singer and guitarist.<ref name=\"Chapter 3\">{{cite web|url=https://durancompilations.com/early3.html |title=Duran Duran \u2013 The Early Days Chapter 3 |publisher=durancompilations.com |access-date=26 May 2022 }}</ref> \n\nIn April 1980, guitarist [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] came from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to audition after responding to an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. Taylor already had a lot of experience from playing with cover bands for years and although he came from a totally different musical background his versatile playing style was seen as a perfect complement to the band.<ref name=\"Chapter 3\" />   In May 1980, London vocalist and drama student [[Simon Le Bon]] was recommended to the band by an ex-girlfriend who worked at the [[Rum Runner (nightclub)|Rum Runner]].<ref name=\"Green\">{{Cite journal|last = Green|first = Jo-Anne|title = Your Mission, Barbarella: Find Duran Duran|journal=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|volume = 24|issue = 456 |publisher=F+W Publications Inc.|date = 16 January 1998|url = http://www.lizardkingduran.com/gold.html | access-date =1 May 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304091132/http://www.lizardkingduran.com/gold.html |archive-date = 4 March 2007}}</ref> The band were immediately impressed by Le Bon and soon completed their first compostion with the new line up, \"Sound of Thunder\" featuring the lyrics by Le Bon.<ref name=\"Chapter 4\">{{cite web|url=https://durancompilations.com/early4.html |title=Duran Duran \u2013 The Early Days Chapter 4 |publisher=durancompilations.com |access-date=26 May 2022 }}</ref> The owners of the club, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow, became the band's management, paying them to work as doormen, disc jockeys and barmen when they were not rehearsing, and also formed the Tritec Music company.<ref name=\"Chapter 4\" />\n\nIn 1980 they recorded two demo tapes and performed in clubs around [[Birmingham]] and London. Later that same year, when touring as an opening act for [[Hazel O'Connor]], the band attracted critical attention, resulting in a bidding war between the record companies [[EMI Records|EMI]] and [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]].<ref>{{harvnb|Malins|2005|p=60}}</ref> \"A certain patriotism\" toward the label of [[The Beatles]] led them to sign with EMI in December. A week later, the first article about Duran Duran in a national magazine appeared in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''. The members of Duran Duran had noticed that Betty Page (pen name for Beverley Glick) was writing about a new movement called [[New romantic]] that would fit the band perfectly and invited her to meet them at the Rum Runner.<ref name=\"Chapter 4\" />\n\nShortly after signing the deal with EMI Duran Duran went to London to record their debut album with producer [[Colin Thurston]] and initial plans for an independent release of the songs \"[[Planet  Earth (Duran Duran song)|Planet Earth]]\" and \"Is There Anyone Out There?\" on the Tritec Music label was scrapped.<ref name=\"Chapter 4\" />\n\n===1981\u20131982: Debut album and ''Rio''===\n{{See also|Duran Duran (1981 album)|Rio (Duran Duran album)}}\nThe band's first album, ''[[Duran Duran (1981 album)|Duran Duran]]'', was released on the EMI label in 1981. The first single, \"[[Planet Earth (Duran Duran song)|Planet Earth]]\", reached the United Kingdom's top 20 at number 12. A follow-up, \"[[Careless Memories]]\", stalled at Number 37. However, it was their third single, \"Girls on Film\", that attracted the most attention. The song went to Number 5 in the UK. The video, featuring topless women [[mud wrestling]], [[pillow fight]]ing and stylised depictions of other [[sexual fetish]]es, was made with directing duo [[Godley & Creme]] in August.<ref name=Shuker>{{harvnb|Shuker|2001|p=170}}</ref> The video was filmed just two weeks after MTV was launched in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Malins|2005|pp=77\u201379}}</ref> The band expected the \"[[Girls on Film]]\" video to be played in the newer nightclubs that had video screens or on [[pay TV]] channels like the [[Playboy Channel]]. [[Kevin Godley]] explained the thinking behind it:\n\n<blockquote>We were very explicitly told by Duran Duran's management to make a very sensational and erotic piece that would be for clubs, where it would get shown uncensored just to make people take notice and talk about it.<ref name=Shuker /></blockquote>\n\nThe video was heavily edited for MTV (Music Television). The album peaked in the UK top twenty at number 3. Later in 1981 the band embarked on their first United States club tour followed by more dates in Germany and the UK. This second tour of Britain coincided with a wave of riots sparked by unemployment and racial tension, including those of [[1981 Moss Side riot|Moss Side]] and [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth]]. The band played Birmingham the day after the [[1981 Handsworth riots|Handsworth riots]]. Duran Duran began to achieve worldwide recognition in 1982. In May they released their second album, ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'', which scored four UK Top Twenty singles with \"[[My Own Way (song)|My Own Way]]\", \"[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]\", \"[[Save a Prayer]]\", and the title song \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\". A headlining tour of Australia, Japan, and the US was followed by a stint supporting [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] during that band's final American tour. [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] declared Duran Duran her favourite band, and the band were dubbed \"the Fab Five\" by the British press, comparing them to [[the Beatles]] whose nickname was the Fab Four.<ref>{{harvnb|Malins|2005|p=118}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=29 March 1984|title=The Charlotte News, 29 March 1984|pages=41|work=The Charlotte News|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67020066/the-charlotte-news-29-march-1984/|access-date=6 January 2021|archive-date=7 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210107124359/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67020066/the-charlotte-news-29-march-1984/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt first, the ''Rio'' album did not do well in the United States. EMI in the UK had promoted Duran Duran as a New Romantic band, but the New Romantic movement was barely known in the US, and EMI's American subsidiary [[Capitol Records]] was at a loss about how to sell them. After ''[[Carnival (Duran Duran EP)|Carnival]]'' (an [[Extended play|EP]] of ''Rio''{{'s}} dance remixes) became popular with DJs in the fall, the band arranged to have most of the album remixed by [[David Kershenbaum]]. In June 1982, Duran Duran appeared for the first time on American television, performing \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Rio\" on ''[[Dancin' On Air]]'', the forerunner to the national hit show ''[[Dance Party USA]]''.\n\nNow promoted as a dance album, ''Rio'' was re-released in the US in November, and began to climb the American charts six months after its European success. MTV placed \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and several other Duran Duran videos into heavy rotation, pushing the single and album into the US top twenty in early 1983. The ballad \"Save a Prayer\" also did well.<ref>{{harvnb|Denisoff|1986|pp=364\u20135}}</ref> \"The band was a natural for music television,\" noted ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. \"They may be the first rock group to ride in on a video wave.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Denisoff|1986|p=365}}</ref> The album ultimately peaked at number 6 in the US and remained on the charts there for 129 weeks.

Before the days of digital synthesizer and easy [[sampling (music)|audio sampling]], they created multi-layered arrangements of their singles, sometimes recording entirely different extended performances of the songs in the studio. These \"night versions\" were generally available only on [[gramophone record|vinyl]] as [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]] to 45 rpm singles or on 12-inch club singles until the release of the compilation ''[[Night Versions: The Essential Duran Duran]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |title=Night Versions: The Essential Duran Duran - Duran Duran |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r342815|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Larkin |first=Colin |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=0-85712-595-8 |edition=5th concise |author-link=Colin Larkin (writer)}}</ref>\n\n===1983\u20131985: The \"Fab Five\", Side projects and Live Aid===\n{{See also|Seven and the Ragged Tiger|The Power Station (band)|Arcadia (band)}}\nThe band began 1983 by playing the MTV New Year's Eve Rock 'n' Roll Ball with \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" still climbing the charts in the US, and the American reissue of the \"Rio\" single to follow in March. To satisfy America's appetite for their music,<ref name=\"Green\" /> the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US in the middle of the year with the addition of the new single \"[[Is There Something I Should Know?]]\". Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number 1 in the UK (a rarity then and their first [[chart-topper]] in their home country) and reached number 4 on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]] for a show, during which artist and admirer [[Andy Warhol]] dropped by to greet them. \"Our first gigs in the United States were crazy and culty\", Rhodes said later, \"But when we came back after 'Hungry' was a hit, it was mayhem.

They followed up with \"[[New Moon on Monday]]\", which reached Number 9 in the UK. Their next single \"[[The Reflex]]\", taken from ''Seven and the Ragged Tiger'' and given a significant remix overhaul by [[Nile Rodgers]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]] fame, became their first number one hit in the United States. \"The Reflex\" was also their second and final [[List of number-one singles (UK)|UK number one]] and was successful in numerous other countries around the world.\n\n[[File:Duran duran pelo 1984.jpg|thumb|250px|Duran Duran in 1984]]\nThe band embarked on a global tour that continued throughout the first four months of 1984 including their first major stadium dates in America.

In February 1984, the band appeared on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and won two [[Grammy Award]]s in the brand-new [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Long Form]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Short Form]] music video categories. Meanwhile, \"[[Save a Prayer]]\" gained momentum in North America, and a special US remix of the song became a single in January 1985. It peaked at No.&nbsp;16 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in March. A live version of the song was used for the single's B-side, taken from the concert video footage for ''Arena'' / ''[[As the Lights Go Down]]''.\n\nDuring this period, all of the band members became heartthrobs for many of their young teenage fans. After the tour, Roger Taylor was married in [[Naples]], Italy, and Nick Rhodes wed in London, wearing a pink velvet tuxedo and top hat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Hauptfuhrer|first = Fred |title = Wedding bells toll for Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes, who marries an Iowa heiress|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date = 3 September 1985 |url = http://www.lizardkingduran.com/wedding.html | access-date =18 May 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070412062952/http://www.lizardkingduran.com/wedding.html |archive-date = 12 April 2007}}</ref> At the end of 1984, the group featured on the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] benefit single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" along with other popular British and Irish musical acts.

John Taylor and Andy Taylor wanted to break away from the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] and [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] to form the rock/funk supergroup [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]], which released two Top 10 singles. Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes wanted to further explore Duran Duran's atmospheric aspect and formed [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]], who released one LP (''So Red the Rose'') from which the single \"Election Day\" was released. Contributors to that album included guitarist [[Masami Tsuchiya]], bassist [[Mark Egan]], percussionist [[David Van Tieghem]], drummer [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[David Gilmour]]. Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well as contributing percussion to the Power Station album. Duran Duran were never the same after this break. According to Rhodes, the two side projects \"were commercial suicide... But we've always been good at that.\"<ref name=Blender/> The band was still off balance when they regrouped to contribute \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\" to the 1985 [[James Bond]] movie [[A View to a Kill|of the same name]]. This single was the first [[James Bond music|Bond theme]] to go to number 1 on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number 2. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years.\n\nAs a follow-up to the Christmas 1984 Band Aid single, Duran Duran performed in front of 90,000 people (and an estimated 1.5&nbsp;billion TV viewers) at the [[Live Aid]] charity concert at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, on 13 July 1985 while their Bond song held the top spot on the American charts. It was not intended to be a farewell performance\u2014the band planned only to take a break after four years of non-stop touring and public appearances\u2014but the original five did not play live together again until July 2003.

An official press release was issued in April 1986 confirming his departure. In a 2004 interview with Live Daily, Roger Taylor confirmed his reasons for leaving: \"I was burned out. I think I was just exhausted. It was a very intense five years. We didn't stop. It was constant touring, constant writing, recording. We broke internationally, as well\u2014instantly, pretty well.

The band resorted to legal measures to get him into the studio but after numerous delays they let him go at last. He played on only a few songs on the next album, including A Matter of Feeling, whilst the disagreements were being settled.<ref>{{harvnb|Malins|2005|pp=187\u2013190}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Duran duran pelo 1988.jpg|thumb|170px|Rhodes, John Taylor and Le Bon in 1988]]\nWithout a guitarist or a drummer, the three remaining members, Le Bon, Rhodes, and John Taylor had producer (and former Chic guitarist) [[Nile Rodgers]] play a few tracks on guitar, and hired [[Steve Ferrone]] to play drums while they searched for replacements. Finally in September 1986, [[Warren Cuccurullo]] (formerly of [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]] and [[Frank Zappa]]'s band) was hired as a session guitarist.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|date=7 August 1987|title=Forth Worth Stare-Telegram, 07 Aug 1987|pages=112|work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67030198/forth-worth-stare-telegram-07-aug-1987/|access-date=7 January 2021|archive-date=7 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210107193902/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67030198/forth-worth-stare-telegram-07-aug-1987/|url-status=live}}</ref> With Le Bon, Rhodes, and Taylor, he recorded the rest of the ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]'' album, which was released in October 1986. The black-and-white documentary film ''Three to Get Ready'' chronicled the recording of the album, legal tensions, and preparations for the tour.\n\nAlthough the song \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\" went to number 2 in the US, number 7 in the UK, the album was a relative failure globally with the album peaking in the UK at No.16 and spending one week in the top 50 album chart and consequently the band found they had lost much of the momentum and hysteria they had left behind in 1985. In the three years between the release of ''Seven and the Ragged Tiger'' and ''Notorious'', many of their teenage fans had grown up and the music was funkier, more mature, and less \"pop\", given the added experience of their work on Arcadia and Power Station and with other musicians. \"[[Skin Trade (song)|Skin Trade]]\" and \"[[Meet El Presidente]]\", the two subsequent singles, made the charts but fared poorly compared to the band's earlier successes. Finally in late 1987, [[Sterling Campbell]] was hired as a session drummer.\n\nSubsequently, Duran Duran struggled to escape the [[teen idol]] image and gain respect among critics with more complex music. The new serious image was not accepted at first and their popularity began to wane. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, \"In their search for musical maturity, the surviving Durans have lost a good deal of their identity.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine |last = Coleman |first = Mark |title = Review of ''Notorious'' |magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] |publisher = Wenner Publishing |date = 29 January 1987 |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/179366/review/5946832 |access-date = 14 May 2007 |archive-date = 20 May 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090520165931/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/179366/review/5946832 |url-status = dead }}</ref> In contrast the ''New York Times'' said, \"Duran Duran's newfound disillusionment may mark a step toward maturity...they managed to catch a trend on the upswing, perhaps \"Notorious\" suggests that for late 1980s grit and pessimism is coming into style.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/arts/a-smaller-duran-duran-finds-disillusionment.html|title=A Smaller Duran Duran Finds Disillusionment|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=7 December 1986|work=The New York Times|access-date=8 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=8 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108145508/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/arts/a-smaller-duran-duran-finds-disillusionment.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Another factor was the band's dismissal of early managers, the Berrow brothers. There was no announcement of the reasons for the decision, but disagreements over money, and the brothers' involvement in Le Bon's yachting adventures (they were co-owners of ''[[Drum (yacht)|Drum]]'') were thought to have played a part.<ref>{{harvnb|Malins|2005|p=174}}</ref> Whatever the reason, Duran Duran switched managers frequently and undertook periods of self-management in the later stages of their career. In addition, EMI fired its president and went through a major corporate restructuring that summer and seemed to have lost interest in promoting the band.<ref>{{harvnb|Malins|2005|p=186}}</ref> According to Nick Rhodes the band needed to break up in order to come back together stronger.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe next album ''[[Big Thing (Duran Duran album)|Big Thing]]'' (1988) yielded the singles \"[[I Don't Want Your Love]]\" (number 4 in the US), and \"[[All She Wants Is]]\" (the last top ten hit in the UK until 1993). The record was experimental, mixing influences from [[house music]] and [[rave]]s with Duran's atmospheric [[synthpop]] and the creative guitar work of Cuccurullo (now a full band member), as well as more mature lyrics.\n\n===1989\u20131991: Five again, ''Decade'' and ''Liberty''===\n{{See also|Decade (Duran Duran album)|Liberty (Duran Duran album)}}\nBy the end of 1989 and at the start of the 1990s, the popularity of synthpop was fading a bit and losing fans to other momentum-gaining music genres at the time, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[techno]] and [[alternative rock]].

The single came and went with little fanfare, but the album became another major seller for the band. However, the 1990 release ''[[Liberty (Duran Duran album)|Liberty]]'' (a retreat from the experimentation of ''[[Big Thing (Duran Duran album)|Big Thing]]'') failed to capitalise on any regained momentum. The album entered the UK album chart in the top ten, but faded away quickly. The singles \"[[Violence of Summer|Violence of Summer (Love's Taking Over)]]\" and \"[[Serious (Duran Duran song)|Serious]]\" were only mildly successful. For the first time, Duran Duran did not tour in support of an album, performing on only a handful of club dates and TV shows.<ref>{{harvnb|Malins|2005|p=213}}</ref> Sterling Campbell left the band early in 1991, going on to work with [[Soul Asylum]] and [[David Bowie]].

Both the band and the record label seemed to be caught by surprise by the album's critical and commercial success (No.&nbsp;4 in the UK, No.&nbsp;7 in the US). Bassist John Taylor had been considering leaving the band but changed his mind. The band's largest tour ever, which included stops in the Middle East, the then recently de-embargoed South Africa, and South America, was halted after seven months when Le Bon suffered from strained [[vocal cords]]. After six weeks' recuperation, the band performed intermittently for another five months, including appearances in Israel, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nIn 1995, the band released the cover album ''[[Thank You (Duran Duran album)|Thank You]]''. Songs from ''Thank You'' included covers of [[Lou Reed]]'s \"[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]\" and [[Melle Mel]]'s \"[[White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)]]\" (with backing vocals from the original artists). The album also marked the temporary return of former drummer Roger Taylor, who joined the band in studio to play drums on \"Watching the Detectives\" and \"Perfect Day\" (as well as a cover of \"Jeepster\" by T. Rex that did not appear on the album). In a video interview provided with the album's [[electronic press kit]], Reed said he considered Duran Duran's version the best cover ever done of one of his songs, and they received praise from Robert Plant and Jimmy Page for their cover of Led Zeppelin's \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".<ref name=Edwards />\n\n===1997\u20132000: John Taylor's departure and second trio===\n{{See also|Medazzaland|Pop Trash}}\nAfter the promo tour for ''Thank You'' was completed, John Taylor co-founded the B5 Records label, recorded a solo album, founded and toured with the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Neurotic Outsiders]], and reunited the Power Station, though the project proceeded without him when he had to withdraw to deal with his divorce from De Cadenet. Finally, after struggling for months to record the next album, ''Medazzaland'', in January 1997, Taylor announced at the DuranCon [[fan convention]] that he was leaving the band \"for good\".<ref>{{Cite magazine|last = Green|first = Michelle|title = Duran Duran Comes Undone|magazine = [[Rolling Stone]]|publisher = Wenner Publishing|date = 23 January 1997|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johntaylor2/articles/story/5924427/duran_duran_comes_undone|access-date = 18 May 2007|archive-date = 14 April 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090414131052/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johntaylor2/articles/story/5924427/duran_duran_comes_undone|url-status = dead}}</ref> His departure reduced the band to two long time members (Le Bon and Rhodes) and Cuccurullo, who decided to continue recording under the name Duran Duran.\n\nFreed from some internal writing conflicts, the band returned to the studio to rewrite and re-record many of the songs on ''[[Medazzaland]]''. (Taylor's work remains on only four tracks.) This album marked a return to the layered experimentation of ''Big Thing'', with intricate guitar textures and processed vocals. The track \"[[Out of My Mind (Duran Duran song)|Out of My Mind]]\" was used as the theme song for the movie ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'', but the only true single to be released in the United States was the quirky \"[[Electric Barbarella]]\", which was the first single ever to be sold online.<ref>{{harvnb|Haring|2000|pp=77\u201379}}</ref> The video for this single, featuring a sexy robot purchased and played with by band members, had to be censored before airing on MTV, but there was little of the controversy that had surrounded \"Girls on Film\". \"Barbarella\" peaked at No.&nbsp;52 in the US in October 1997.<ref>{{harvnb|Malins|2005|p=246}}</ref> Although ''Medazzaland'' was released in the US in October 1997, the album was never released in the UK. \"Barbarella\" was later released in the UK as a single from the 1998 ''[[Greatest (Duran Duran)|Greatest]]'' compilation album and peaked at No.&nbsp;23 on the UK chart in January 1999.

The band then signed what was intended to be a three-album contract with Disney's [[Hollywood Records]], but it lasted only through the poorly received 2000 album ''[[Pop Trash]]''.

Cuccurullo then announced on his website that he was leaving Duran Duran to resume work with his 1980s band [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]]. This announcement was confirmed the next day by Duran Duran's website, followed a day later by the news that John, Roger, and Andy Taylor had rejoined. To fulfill contractual obligations, Cuccurullo played three Duran Duran concerts in Japan in June 2001, ending his tenure in the band.\n\nThroughout 2001, 2002 and 2003, the band worked on writing new material, initially renting a house in [[St. Tropez]] where sound engineer [[Mark Tinley]] built a recording studio for their first serious writing session. They then returned to London to do some self-financed work with various producers (including old friend Nile Rodgers) and search for a new record deal. It proved difficult to find a record label willing to gamble on the band's comeback, so Duran Duran went on tour to prove the drawing power of the reunited band.

A [[remix]] of the new track \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\" was released on many TV shows in February while magazines hailed (the modern \"Fab Five\") Duran Duran as one of the greatest bands of all time.<ref name=\"Ferber\">{{Cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Ferber |title=Wild Boys take 2 |url=http://www.southernvoice.com/2004/10-29/arts/feature/wildboy.cfm |work=[[Southern Voice (newspaper)|Southern Voice]] |publisher=[[Window Media]] |date=29 October 2004 |access-date=19 May 2007 |archive-date=6 May 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060506091147/http://www.southernvoice.com/2004/10-29/arts/feature/wildboy.cfm |url-status=live }}</ref> Duran Duran then celebrated their homecoming to the UK with fourteen stadium dates in April 2004, including five sold-out nights at [[Wembley Arena]]. The British press, traditionally hostile to the band, accorded the shows some very warm reviews.<ref>{{harvnb|Malins|2005|pp=273\u2013274}}</ref> Duran Duran brought along band [[Goldfrapp]] and the [[Scissor Sisters]] as alternating opening acts for this tour.<ref name=\"Sandall\" /> The last two shows were filmed, resulting in the concert DVD ''[[Live from London (Duran Duran)|Duran Duran: Live from London]]'' which was released in November.\n\nFinally, with more than thirty-five songs completed, the band signed a two-album contract with [[Epic Records]] in June, and completed the new album, now entitled ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]''. The album was released in October 2004 and entered the UK charts at number 3 and the US charts at number 17. The first single was \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\", which reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' US Dance chart in November and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, Duran Duran's highest chart position since \"A View to a Kill\" in 1985. A second single, \"[[What Happens Tomorrow]]\", debuted at No.&nbsp;11 on the UK chart in February. A 5.1 mix of ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'' was created by Jeremy Wheatley for the dual-disc release of ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]''. The CD side contains the album as-is and the DVD side contains the 5.1 mix of the album in DVD Audio format along with some DVD footage and videos.\n\nAfter a world tour in early 2005, Duran Duran were presented with the PRS Outstanding Contribution to British Music at the 2005 Ivor Novello Awards. Later that summer, the band headlined the massive [[Live 8 concert, Rome]] on 2 July 2005 in the [[Circus Maximus]].\n\n===2006\u20132008: ''Red Carpet Massacre'' and Andy Taylor's second departure===\n{{See also|Red Carpet Massacre}}[[File:Duran Duran Bogota 2008.JPG|thumb|right|In Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, 2008]]\nIn early 2006, Duran Duran covered [[John Lennon]]'s song \"[[Instant Karma!]]\" for the ''Make Some Noise'' campaign sponsored by [[Amnesty International]]. Their version later appeared on ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]'' as an [[iTunes]] exclusive bonus track. They also performed at two high-profile events&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize Awards]] and the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. After a couple of weeks of songwriting in Northern California, the band began working with producer [[Michael Patterson (producer)|Michael Patterson]] in London, and continued intermittently for the next several months. At one point, they reported having had fifteen tracks nearly complete for an album tentatively titled ''[[Reportage (album)|Reportage]]'', but no further news emerged from the band for months afterward. In September, the band held meetings in New York City with [[Justin Timberlake]] and producer [[Timbaland]] with an eye to a potential collaboration and were soon reported to have completed three songs with the producer, including a song with [[Justin Timberlake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhnlive.com/news/more/430.html |title=Duran Duran and Timbaland |date=10 March 2006 |website=HHNLive.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108101746/http://www.hhnlive.com/news/more/430.html |archive-date=8 November 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 October 2006, Duran Duran parted company with Andy Taylor once again. In an official announcement on their website, the band stated that an \"unworkable gulf\" had developed between them and Taylor and that \"we can no longer effectively function together\". It was noted by Andy Taylor in his book ''Wild Boy'' that tensions had arisen between the group's management and himself, and he was also diagnosed with clinical depression connected with the death of his father. [[Dominic Brown|Dom Brown]], who had previously toured with the band, again took over guitar duties and has been performing with them since.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dombrown.com/ |title= Dominic Brown: Musician with Duran Duran |publisher= dombrown.com |access-date= 16 May 2006 |archive-date= 9 May 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060509165318/http://www.dombrown.com/ |url-status= live }}</ref> After Taylor's departure, the band scrapped the ''Reportage'' album. They wrote and recorded a new album titled ''[[Red Carpet Massacre]]'', which included the Timbaland tracks. [[Dominic Brown|Dom Brown]] is the featured guitarist on the album.\n\nIn July 2007, the band performed twice at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Their first appearance at the stadium was the [[Concert for Diana]] which celebrated the life of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] almost 10 years after her death. The band performed \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\", \"[[Wild Boys (song)|Wild Boys]]\" and \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/concertfordiana/timeline/ |title=Concert for Diana \u2013 What happened minute by minute |work=BBC News |access-date=4 July 2013 |archive-date=31 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731124144/http://www.bbc.co.uk/concertfordiana/timeline/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Their second appearance was at [[Live Earth concert, London]]. On 25 September, the Timberlake collaboration \"[[Falling Down (Duran Duran song)|Falling Down]]\" was released as a download single on [[iTunes]], and the band announced that they would play nine shows at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on Broadway to launch the ''Red Carpet Massacre'' album. The album launch was later extended to incorporate a show in London on 3 December 2007 and one in Dublin on 5 December 2007.\n\nIn May 2008, they toured the US leg of their 2008 world tour and were supported by the British band [[Your Vegas]]. In June 2008, they played the [[Louvre]] in Paris in a fundraising effort that contributed to the restoration of a [[Louis XV]] drawing room. Guests dined, privately viewed some of the museum's artworks, then attended a performance by the band in the [[I.M. Pei]]-designed [[Louvre Pyramid|Pyramid du Louvre]]. The group's performance marked a first for the 18th-century museum which had never before allowed a rock concert to occur anywhere within the grounds or buildings and another groundbreaker for Duran Duran.\n\nOn 2 July 2008, in Paris, [[Mark Ronson]] performed a unique live set with Duran Duran for an exclusive, invitation-only performance. Together, they showcased specially re-worked versions of some of Duran Duran's classic hits re-created by Ronson, along with tracks from ''Red Carpet Massacre''. Simon Le Bon also performed songs from Ronson's latest album, ''[[Version (album)|Version]]'', as one of Ronson's featured guest vocalists. Unlike the band's previous album ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'', ''Red Carpet Massacre'' sold poorly and received mixed responses from the music press. In 2008, ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'' was included in the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' series.\n\n===2009\u20132012: ''All You Need Is Now''===\n{{See also|All You Need Is Now}}[[File:Duran Duran (6874514374).jpg|thumb|right|Duran Duran at the [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]], Australia, 2012]]\nThe band departed from Epic Records in 2009, after releasing just two albums. In early 2010, it was revealed that the band would be contributing a cover of \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\" to a tribute/charity record for [[David Bowie]] called ''[[We Were So Turned On: A Tribute to David Bowie|We Were So Turned On]]'' from which all profits go to [[War Child (charity)|War Child]]. Other contributing artists included [[Carla Bruni]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros]], and [[Warpaint (band)|Warpaint]]. The album was released on 14 September 2010 on [[Manimal Vinyl]] Records. A limited edition split 7-inch single with Duran Duran and [[Carla Bruni]] was also released on [[Manimal Vinyl]] in December 2010.\n\nOn 21 December 2010, Duran Duran's 13th studio album, titled ''[[All You Need Is Now]]'', produced by the [[Grammy]] Award-winning [[Mark Ronson]] and mixed by [[Spike Stent]], was released exclusively on [[iTunes]] and hit the No.&nbsp;1 spot on download charts in 15 countries (including the UK).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17851 |title=ALL YOU NEED IS NOW Out in the UK on March&nbsp;21 |publisher=Duran Duran |date=18 February 2011 |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-date=21 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221014238/http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17851 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first single from the record, title track \"All You Need Is Now\", was free to download worldwide on 8 December 2010 exclusively in iTunes.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} Guitarist and songwriter [[Dominic Brown|Dom Brown]] co-wrote all but two songs on the album.\n\nThe expanded physical album, including various format special packages, was released in March 2011, only weeks after the 30th anniversary of the band's first release \"Planet Earth\".

Les Garland, senior executive vice-president at MTV, said \"I remember our director of talent and artist relations came running in and said, \"You have got to see this video that's come in\". Duran Duran were getting zero radio airplay at the time, and MTV wanted to try to break new music. \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" was the greatest video I'd ever seen\".<ref name=Blender/> The band's video work was influential in several ways. First, Duran Duran filmed in exotic locales like [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Antigua]], creating memorable images that were radically different from the then-common low budget \"band-playing-on-a-stage\" videos. Second, rather than simply playing their instruments, the band participated in mini-storylines (often taking inspiration from contemporary movies: \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" riffs on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', \"The Wild Boys\" on ''[[The Road Warrior]]'', etc.). Videos were obviously headed in this direction already, but Duran Duran led the trend with a style, featuring quick editing, arresting graphic design, and surreal-to-nonsensical image inserts, that drew attention from commentators and spawned a wealth of imitators.\n\nDuran Duran were among the first bands to have their videos shot with a professional movie camera on 35mm film, rather than on videotape, making them look superior to many of the quickly shot videos which had been MTV staples until then. MTV provided Duran Duran with access to American radio markets that were unfriendly to British music, new wave music, or \"anything with synthesisers\". Because MTV was not available everywhere in the United States at first, it was easy to see a pattern: where MTV went, listener demand for Duran Duran, [[Tears for Fears]], [[Def Leppard]] and other European bands with interesting videos went through the roof.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/musictelevis/musictelevis.htm |title=Music Television |access-date=17 May 2007 |author=Burns, Gary |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |archive-date=31 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531225420/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/musictelevis/musictelevis.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The band's sun-drenched videos for \"Rio\", \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Save a Prayer\", and the surreal \"Is There Something I Should Know?\" were filmed by future movie director [[Russell Mulcahy]], who made 11 videos for the band. Duran Duran have always sought out innovative directors and techniques, even in their later years when MTV gave them little airplay. In addition to Mulcahy, they have had videos filmed by influential photographers [[Dean Chamberlain]] and [[Ellen von Unwerth]], Chinese director [[Chen Kaige]], documentary filmmaker [[Julien Temple]], and the [[Polish Brothers]], among others. According to Nick Rhodes, \"Video is to us like stereo was to [[Pink Floyd]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Denisoff|1986|p=364}}</ref>\n\n{{Blockquote|\"The British won out here, hands down. Next to the prosaic, foursquare appearance of the American bands, such acts as Duran Duran seemed like caviar. MTV opened up a whole new world that could not be fully apprehended over the radio.

The band has said that a huge amount of unreleased concert and documentary footage has been filmed over the years, which they hope can be edited and released in some form in the near future.

The video was directed by [[Jonas Akerlund]], and during the filming, an editorial was made for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' magazine.\n\n==Visual style==\nFrom the beginning of their career, all the members had a keen sense of visual style.

They have continued to present fashion as part of their package throughout their career. In the 1990s they worked with [[Vivienne Westwood]] and in the 2000s with [[Giorgio Armani]]. The band retained creative control of their visual presentation having worked closely with graphic designer [[Malcolm Garrett]] and many others over the years to create album covers, tour programs and other materials.<ref name=TheirStory>{{Cite book|last=De Graaf |first=Kaspar |author2=Garret, Malcolm |title=Duran Duran: Their Story |year=1982 |publisher=Cherry Lane Books |location=UK |isbn=0-86276-171-9 |page=14}}</ref>\n\nTeen and music magazines in the UK latched onto their good looks quickly, and the USA soon followed.
