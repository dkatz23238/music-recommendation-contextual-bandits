The band released 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to their break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, \"[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]\" and \"[[Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?]]\" remain the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 277}}</ref> They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of which, ''[[The Gift (The Jam album)|The Gift]]'', hit number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]].

This placed the act at the forefront of the 1970s\u20131980s nascent [[Mod Revival]] movement. With many of the band's lyrics about [[working class]] life,<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.irishnews.com/arts/2018/09/14/news/paul-weller-divided-britain-is-just-another-tool-of-this-hopeless-tory-government-1431078/ | title= Paul Weller: 'Divided Britain' is just another tool of this hopeless Tory government | work=[[The Irish News]] | first=Andrew | last=Arthur | date=14 September 2018 | access-date=29 August 2020}}</ref> Jam biographer Sean Egan commented that they \"took social protest and cultural authenticity to the top of the charts.\"<ref>''Love With a Passion Called Hate: The Inside Story of The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-0-9545750-9-0}} p. 1</ref>\n\nThe band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including 1960s [[beat music]], soul, [[rhythm and blues]] and [[psychedelic rock]], as well as 1970s punk and [[New wave music|new wave]]. The trio were known for their melodic pop songs, their distinctly English flavour and their [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] image. The band launched the career of [[Paul Weller]], who went on to form [[the Style Council]] and later his solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of the Jam's original compositions and played lead guitar, using a [[Rickenbacker 330]]. [[Bruce Foxton]] provided backing vocals and prominent basslines, which were the foundation of many of the band's songs, including the hits \"[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]\", \"[[The Eton Rifles]]\", \"[[Going Underground]]\" and \"[[Town Called Malice]]\" mainly using a [[Rickenbacker 4001]] or a [[Fender Precision Bass]], as well as, on rare occasions, an [[Epiphone Rivoli]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1972\u20131976)===\n[[File:Rickenbacker 330JG.jpg|upright=.69|thumb|A [[Rickenbacker 330]]. Weller frequently recorded and performed live with the Jam using this instrument]]\n[[File:Paulweller1.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Paul Weller]] performing in the 2000s]]\n\nThe Jam formed in Woking, Surrey, England, in 1972. The line-up was fluid at this stage, consisting of [[Paul Weller]] on bass and lead vocals<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-1-783-05794-8}} p. 33</ref> together with various friends at [[Sheerwater Secondary School]]. They played their first gigs at Michael's, a local club. The line-up began to solidify in the mid-1970s with  Weller, guitarist/vocalist Steve Brookes and drummer [[Rick Buckler]]. In their early years, their sets consisted of covers of early American [[rock and roll]] songs by the likes of [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]]. They continued in this vein until Weller discovered the Who's debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' and became fascinated with Mod music and lifestyle. As he said later, \"I saw that through becoming a Mod it would give me a base and an angle to write from, and this we eventually did. We went out and bought suits and started playing [[Motown]], [[Stax Records|Stax]] and [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] covers. I bought a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar, a [[Lambretta (motorscooter)|Lambretta]] GP 150 and tried to style my hair like [[Steve Marriott]]'s circa '66.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://underground-network.de/weller.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over ska musik.

Up to this point Weller had been playing bass and Foxton had been the band's second guitar player; he persuaded Foxton to take over bass duties and developed a combined lead/rhythm guitar style influenced by the Who's [[Pete Townshend]] as well as [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] guitarist [[Wilko Johnson]]. The line-up of Weller, Foxton, and Buckler would persist until the end of The Jam's career.\n\nThroughout their career, the band were managed by Weller's father, John Weller, who then managed Paul's subsequent career until his death in 2009.<ref name=JohnWeller>{{cite news |author=Pierre Perrone |title=John Weller: Father of Paul Weller who managed his son for 30 years |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-weller-father-of-paul-weller-who-managed-his-son-for-30-years-1674817.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430141158/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-weller-father-of-paul-weller-who-managed-his-son-for-30-years-1674817.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 April 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London |date=27 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the following two years, the Jam gained a small following around London from playing minor gigs, becoming one of the new lights on the nascent punk scene. In many ways, however, they stood out from their punk peers. Though they shared an \"angry young men\" outlook, short hair, crushing volume and lightning-fast tempos, the Jam wore neatly tailored suits where others wore ripped clothes, played professionally where others were defiantly amateurish, and displayed clear 1960s rock influences where others were disdainful (at least ostensibly) of such music (which had been a major influence on the \"[[Arena rock|stadium rock]]\" and \"[[Progressive rock|prog rock]]\" of the 1970s). Indeed, the band were tagged by some journalists as \"revivalists\". They were signed to [[Polydor Records]] by [[Chris Parry (producer)|Chris Parry]] in early 1977.\n\n===Early recordings (1977)===\nOn 29 April 1977, Polydor released the Jam's debut single, \"[[In the City (The Jam song)|In the City]]\", which charted in the Top 40 in the UK.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 65</ref> On 20 May, the band released their debut album [[In the City (The Jam album)|of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19770522/7502/|title=Official Albums Chart Top 60 |website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=12 November 2017}}</ref> The album, like those of [[the Clash]] and [[Sex Pistols]], featured fast, loud and pointed songs. What set it apart from the records of those two bands was its more prevalent 1960s rock influences. The Jam covered [[Larry Williams]]'s \"[[Slow Down (Larry Williams song)|Slow Down]]\" (also covered by [[the Beatles]]) and the [[Batman Theme|theme song]] of the 1960s TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'',<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 66</ref> which was somewhat of a standard for 1960s rock bands. Their originals revealed the influence of [[Motown Records]], [[the Beatles]] and [[the Who]].\n\nThe Jam had political lyrics, condemning [[police brutality]] (\"In the City\") and expansionist development (\"Bricks And Mortar\"). However, one of their most openly political songs, \"Time For Truth\", bemoaned the decline of the [[British Empire]] and expressed disparaging sentiments about \"Uncle Jimmy\" (the Prime Minister, [[James Callaghan]]) in no uncertain terms (\"Whatever happened to the great Empire?\" / \"I think it's time for truth, and the truth is you lost, Uncle Jimmy\"). These pro-Empire sentiments and ostentatious displays of the [[Union Flag]] began to earn the group the tag of \"[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\".<ref name=SLATE>{{cite web |author=David Weigel |title=Margaret Thatcher vs. Pop Culture|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/04/british-musicians-really-hated-margaret-thatcher.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|SLATE]] |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nAfter the non-LP single \"[[All Around the World (The Jam song)|All Around the World]]\" nearly reached the UK Top 10, The Jam, having achieved a notable and loyal following in such a short time,<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 70</ref> were pressed to produce more material quickly. Their second album, ''[[This Is the Modern World]]'', was released later in 1977. Bruce Foxton, generally considered a lesser songwriter than Weller, contributed two songs to the LP (\"Don't Tell Them You're Sane\" and \"London Traffic\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/this-is-the-modern-world-mw0000312237 |title=The Jam: This is the Modern World |publisher=allmusic.com |date=24 May 2010 |access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref> both of which attracted criticism. His composing output gradually decreased, leaving Weller firmly established as the band's chief songwriter.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-1-783-05794-8}} pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\n===''All Mod Cons'' (1978)===\nIn March 1978, the Jam released \"News of the World\", a non-album single that was both written and sung by Foxton. It charted at No.&nbsp;27 in the UK, and was the band's second biggest hit to date. This was the only Foxton solo composition to be released as a Jam A-side. When the band went back into the studio to record a third album of primarily Foxton contributions, their songs were dismissed by producers as poor, and they held off recording an album in hopes that Weller would once again find inspiration. \"News of the World\" is now used in the opening theme of the BBC television show ''[[Mock the Week]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b085z8kv|title=Mock the Week: Christmas Special |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=14 December 2016 |access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nReturning to his hometown of Woking, Weller spent much of his time listening to albums by [[the Kinks]] and coming up with new songs. The Jam released their next single, the double A-side \"[[David Watts (Ray Davies song)|David Watts]]\"/\"'A' Bomb in Wardour Street\". \"David Watts\" was a cover of a Kinks song, throughout which Weller and Foxton traded lead vocals. \"'A' Bomb in Wardour Street\" was a Weller original. One of their hardest and most intense songs, Weller cursed the violent thugs that plagued the punk rock scene over a taut two-chord figure. It became their most successful 7\" since \"[[All Around the World (The Jam song)|All Around the World]]\".\n\nIt was not until their next single, \"[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]\", that the Jam really regained their former critical acclaim. The song was a dramatic account of being mugged by thugs who \"smelled of pubs and [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]] and too many right-wing meetings\". Around this time, The Jam slimmed their team of two producers to one, [[Vic Coppersmith-Heaven]], who helped develop the group's sound with harmonised guitars and acoustic textures. In 1978, the Jam released their third LP, ''[[All Mod Cons]]'', which included three previously released tracks among the 12 in total: \"David Watts\", \"'A' Bomb In Wardour Street\", and \"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\". (It also contained two songs Polydor had previously rejected for single release, the manic \"Billy Hunt\" and the acoustic ballad \"English Rose\".)\n\n===''Setting Sons'' & ''Sound Affects'' (1979\u20131981)===\nFollowing two successful and critically acclaimed non-LP singles, \"[[Strange Town]]\" and \"[[When You're Young (The Jam song)|When You're Young]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/paul-weller/news/paul-weller-three-best-songs-the-jam-changingman/ |title=Paul Weller: I've Written Three Perfect Songs In My Life |publisher=radiox.co.uk |date=10 June 2015|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref> the band released \"[[The Eton Rifles]]\" in advance of their new album. It became their first top 10, rising to No.&nbsp;3 on the UK charts. November 1979 saw the release of the ''[[Setting Sons]]'' album, another UK hit, and their first chart entry in the US, albeit at 137 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album began life as a [[concept album]]<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 131</ref> about three childhood friends, though in the end many of the songs did not relate to this theme. Many of the songs had political overtones; \"The Eton Rifles\" was inspired by skirmishes between demonstrators on a ''Right to Work March'' \u2013 a campaign initiated by the left-wing [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] \u2013 and pupils from [[Eton College]]; \"Little Boy Soldiers\" was an anti-war multi-movement piece in the vein of [[Ray Davies]]. Another notable song from the album was Bruce Foxton's \"Smithers-Jones\", originally a b-side to \"[[When You're Young (The Jam song)|When You're Young]]\". The song is almost unanimously considered to be his greatest contribution to The Jam. Recorded with electric rock instrumentation for the single release, \"Smithers-Jones\" was given a complete makeover for the ''Setting Sons'' album with a string arrangement.\n\nThe band's first single of 1980 was intended to be \"[[Dreams of Children]]\", which combined bleak lyrics lamenting the loss of childhood optimism with hard-edged, psychedelic instrumental backing and production. Due to a labelling error, however, the A- and B-sides of the single were reversed, resulting in the more conventional \"[[Going Underground]]\", the single's planned flipside, getting much more airplay and attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/dreams-of-children-mt0052556220 |title=The Jam: Dreams of Children |publisher=allmusic.com |date=12 June 2013|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref> As a result, only \"Going Underground\" was initially listed on the charts, although the single was eventually officially recognised (and listed) as a double A-side by the time the release reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK. When promoting the album in the United States, the group appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', performing \"[[(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave]]\", a cover of the hit song by the Motown girl group [[Martha and the Vandellas]]. They also appeared on the short-lived American sketch comedy series ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', playing the songs \"Private Hell\" and \u201cStart\u201d.\n\n''[[Sound Affects]]'' was released in November 1980. Paul Weller said that he was influenced by [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson album)|Off the Wall]]''<ref>{{Cite book|title = Paul Weller \u2013 The Changing Man|last = Hewitt|first = Paolo|publisher = corgi books|year = 2008|isbn = 9780552156097|pages = 132}}</ref> also. Indeed, several of the songs recall ''Revolver''-era swirling psychedelia, such as \"Monday\", \"Man in the Corner Shop\", and the acoustic \"[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]\". According to Weller he wrote \"That's Entertainment\", a bitter slice-of-life commentary on the drudgery of modern working-class life, in around 15 minutes upon returning inebriated from the pub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4613|title=That's Entertainment by The Jam Songfacts|website=Songfacts.com|access-date=12 November 2017}}</ref> Despite being only available as an import single, it peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the UK charts, an unprecedented feat. It is now arguably The Jam's most celebrated song. Despite the group's lack of commercial success in America, it even made American magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|list of the 500 greatest songs of all time]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: The Jam--\"That's Entertainment\" |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596151/thats_entertainment |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=4 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619110213/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596151/thats_entertainment |archive-date=19 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\n\"[[Start!]]\", released before the album, became another No.&nbsp;1 single.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 148</ref> It had a very similar bass line, rhythm guitar and guitar solo to The Beatles' ''Revolver'' cut \"[[Taxman]]\", but was arranged as an otherwise completely different song. Some contemporary American R&B influence, including Michael Jackson, show up in Buckler's driving beats that power the album (such as on \"But I'm Different Now\"), and most obviously in Foxton's funk-influenced bassline in \"Pretty Green\". The album also reveals influences of post-punk groups such as [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[XTC]], [[Joy Division]], and [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]]. The album was a No.&nbsp;2 hit in the UK and peaked at No.&nbsp;72 on the US Billboard charts, their most successful American album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/6911760/the-jam/chart |title=Billboard 200 |publisher=billboard.com |date=9 November 2014|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''The Gift'' and break-up (1981\u20131982)===\nTwo non-LP singles, \"[[Funeral Pyre]]\" and \"[[Absolute Beginners (The Jam)|Absolute Beginners]]\", abandoned the psychedelic pop of ''Sound Affects''; \"Absolute Beginners\" (named after a [[Absolute Beginners (novel)|cult novel of the same title]]) had a more R&B-flavoured sound, and \"[[Funeral Pyre]]\" was influenced by [[post-punk]] music. \"Absolute Beginners\" would reach No.&nbsp;4 on the UK charts.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> While missing the US pop charts, its video received regular rotation on budding cable channel [[MTV]]. \"Funeral Pyre\" is built around Buckler's drumming, and aside from the ''Sound Affects'' track \"Music for the Last Couple\", is the only song in the group's catalogue that carries a joint Buckler/Foxton/Weller writing credit. \"Funeral Pyre\" and \"Music for the Last Couple\" are the only songs for which Buckler receives any writing credit.\n\nThe 1982 release ''[[The Gift (The Jam album)|The Gift]]'' \u2013 the band's final studio LP \u2013 was a massive commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;1 on the UK charts while spending an unprecedented 16 weeks on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It featured several soul, funk, and R&B-stylised songs; most notably the No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Town Called Malice]]\", which boasts a Motown-style bassline somewhat reminiscent of [[The Supremes]]' \"You Can't Hurry Love\". The song included work by [[Keith Thomas (saxophonist)|Keith Thomas]] and [[Steve Nichol]], who later became well known as members of the R&B groups [[Legacy (R&B band)|Legacy]] and [[Loose Ends (band)|Loose Ends]] respectively. \"Town Called Malice\", a reality-based tale about dealing with hardship in a small, downtrodden English town, is one of a handful of Jam songs Weller still performs (along with \"[[That's Entertainment (song)|That's Entertainment]]\", \"Man in the Corner Shop\", \"Strange Town\", \"Art School\", \"Start!\" and \"In the Crowd\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/paul-weller-96-1295849|title=Paul Weller Reunites with The Jam's Bruce Foxton at London Gig|website=nme.com|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/news/paul-weller-reunites-with-jam-bandmate-bruce-foxton-48040/|title=Paul Weller Reunites with Jam Bandmate Bruce Foxton|website=uncut.co.uk|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Review: He's Still the Changingman - Brilliant Paul Weller Just Keeps on Getting Better|work=The Northampton Chronicle|date=25 August 2018}}</ref> When \"Town Called Malice\" reached number one the group had the honour of performing both it and its double A-side, \"Precious\" on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' \u2013 the only other band to be accorded this honour being the Beatles.

The latter featured [[Tracie Young]] on vocals; a few months later, she also guested on [[The Style Council]]'s debut single \"[[Speak Like a Child (song)|Speak Like a Child]]\".\n\nTo universal surprise, on 30 October 1982 Weller announced his intention to disband The Jam after a short concert tour of the UK had been completed. They also made their final appearances on ''Top of the Pops'' and ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' to promote \"Beat Surrender\". The tour included five consecutive nights at the [[Wembley Arena]], all of which sold out within twenty minutes of tickets becoming available. The last date on the original itinerary had been scheduled for 9 December 1982 at [[Guildford Civic Hall]], close to the band's hometown of Woking. However, due to ticket demand, an additional date was added at the [[Brighton Conference Centre]] on 11 December 1982 for their last performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wells|first1=Simon|title=The Jam: December 11th 1982 by Simon Wells|url=http://www.modculture.co.uk/the-jam-december-11th-1982-by-simon-wells/|website=Modculture|access-date=20 December 2016|date=6 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to split was solely Weller's. Explaining at the time that he disliked the idea of continuing for as long as possible simply because they were successful, he later told the Daily Mirror in advance of a 2015 Sky documentary on the band, \"I wanted to end it to see what else I was capable of, and I'm still sure we stopped at the right time.
