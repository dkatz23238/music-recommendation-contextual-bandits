In 1963, he joined [[Jimmy Powell (singer)|The Dimensions]] as a harmonica player and vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined [[Long John Baldry]] and the [[All-Stars (band)|All Stars]] before moving to the [[The Jeff Beck Group|Jeff Beck Group]] in 1967. Joining [[Faces (band)|Faces]] in 1969, he also maintained a solo career releasing his debut album that year.

His 1972 follow-up album, ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Rod Stewart album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'', also reached number one in the UK and Australia, while going top three in the US and Canada. Its single, \"[[You Wear It Well]]\", topped the chart in the UK and was a moderate hit elsewhere.\n\nAfter Stewart had a handful more UK top ten hits, the Faces broke up in 1975. Stewart's next few hit singles were ballads with \"[[Sailing (Sutherland Brothers song)|Sailing]]\", off the 1975 UK and Australian number-one album, ''[[Atlantic Crossing]]'', becoming a hit in the UK and the Netherlands (number one), Germany (number four) and other countries, but barely charting in North America. ''[[A Night on the Town (Rod Stewart album)|A Night on the Town]]'' (1976), his fifth straight chart-topper in the UK, began a three-album run of going number one or top three in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia with each release. That album's \"[[Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)]]\" spent almost two months at number one in the US and Canada, and made the top five in other countries. ''[[Foot Loose & Fancy Free]]'' (1977) contained the hit \"[[You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)]]\" as well as the rocker \"Hot Legs\". ''[[Blondes Have More Fun]]'' (1978) and its disco-tinged \"[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy]]\" both went to number one in Canada, Australia and the US, with \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\" also hitting number one in the UK and the top ten in other countries. Stewart's albums regularly hit the upper rungs of the charts in the Netherlands throughout the 70s and in Sweden from 1975 onward.\n    \nAfter a disco and [[New wave music|new wave]] period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stewart's music turned to a [[soft rock]]/[[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] style, with most of his albums reaching the top ten in the UK, Germany and Sweden, but faring less well in the US. The single \"[[Rhythm of My Heart]]\" was a top five hit in the UK, US and other countries, with its source album, 1991's ''[[Vagabond Heart]]'', becoming, at number ten in the US and number two in the UK, his highest-charting album in a decade. In 1993, he collaborated with [[Bryan Adams]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] on the power ballad \"[[All for Love (song)|All for Love]]\", which went to number one in many countries. In the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the [[Great American Songbook]]. \n\nIn 2008, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the \"''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-artists-20.shtml|title=Billboard Hot 100 Chart 50th Anniversary|magazine=Billboard|access-date=1 October 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929181345/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-artists-20.shtml|archive-date=29 September 2010}}</ref> A [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and [[Brit Award]] recipient, he was voted at No. 33 in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s list of the Top 100 Greatest Singers of all time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm|title=The Music That Changed The World Q Magazine \u2013 3 Special Editions Jan, Feb, March 2004|publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref>  As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994, the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006, and he was inducted a second time into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Faces.<ref name=\"soloinduction\">{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/rod-stewart|title=Rod Stewart: Inducted in 1994 \u2013 The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=Rockhall.com|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"facesinduction\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rod-stewart-ill-definitely-make-myself-available-for-a-faces-reunion-20111207|title=Rod Stewart: 'I'll Definitely Make Myself Available' for a Faces Reunion|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=28 September 2014|date=7 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nRoderick David Stewart was born at 507 Archway Road, [[Highgate, London|Highgate]], [[North London]], on 10 January 1945, the youngest of five children of Robert Joseph Stewart (26 December 1904<ref name=\"auto\">1939 England and Wales Register</ref>\u20131990)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Robert-Stewart/6000000010641917439|title=Robert Joseph Stewart|publisher=Geni}}</ref> and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart (14 December 1905<ref name=\"auto\"/>\u20131996).<ref name=\"nb-53\">Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 53.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Elsie-Stewart/6000000010641904390|title=Elsie Rebecca Stewart|publisher=Geni}}</ref> His father was Scottish and had been a [[master builder]] in [[Leith]], [[Edinburgh]], while Elsie was English and had grown up in [[Upper Holloway]] in [[North London]].

Repeating the ''Every Picture'' formula, for the most part, it reached number two on the US album charts and number one in the UK,<ref name=\"RockHall\"/> and enjoyed further good notices from reviewers. \"You Wear It Well\" was a hit single that reached number 13 in the US and went to number one in the UK, while \"Twisting the Night Away\" made explicit Stewart's debt to [[Sam Cooke]].\n\nFor the body of his early solo work Stewart earned tremendous critical praise. ''Rolling Stone'''s 1980 ''Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'' includes this in its Stewart entry:<ref name=\"rshist-377\">Marcus, \"Rod Stewart\", in ''Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'', p. 377.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Rarely has a singer had as full and unique a talent as Rod Stewart; rarely has anyone betrayed his talent so completely. Once the most compassionate presence in music, he has become a bilious self-parody \u2013 and sells more records than ever [... A] writer who offered profound lyricism and fabulous self-deprecating humour, teller of tall tales and honest heartbreaker, he had an unmatched eye for the tiny details around which lives turn, shatter, and reform [...] and a voice to make those details indelible. [... His solo albums] were defined by two special qualities: warmth, which was redemptive, and modesty, which was liberating. If ever any rocker chose the role of everyman and lived up to it, it was Rod Stewart.</blockquote>\n[[File:Rod Stewart and Ron Wood - Faces - 1975.jpg|thumb|left|Stewart (right) whilst in [[Faces (band)|Faces]], with [[Ronnie Wood]] (left)]]\nThe Faces released their final album ''[[Ooh La La (Faces album)|Ooh La La]],'' which reached number one in the UK and number 21 in the US in 1973.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\"/><ref name=\"Roberts\"/> During the recording of the album, the rift between Stewart and the rest of the Faces grew further, as (according to [[Ian McLagan]]), Stewart did not participate until two weeks into the sessions, \"and then complained that some songs were in the wrong key for him. So we recorded them again and waited a week for him to come back. We cut the track for 'Ooh La La' three times before he eventually passed on it, leaving it for [[Ronnie Wood|Woody]] to sing.

In Britain, it reached number one, and the single \"Farewell\" number seven, but only number 13 on the ''Billboard'' pop album charts and the single \"Mine for Me\" only number 91 on the ''Billboard'' pop singles charts. It was his last original album for Mercury Records. After the release of the double album compilation ''The Best of Rod Stewart'' he switched to [[Warner Bros. Records]] and remained with them throughout the vast majority of his career (Faces were signed to Warner Bros., and Stewart's solo releases in the UK appeared on the Riva label until 1981). In 1975, Faces toured the US twice (with Ronnie Wood joining [[The Rolling Stones]]' US tour in between).<ref name=\"nzentgrafwoodworks\"/>  With Ronnie Wood having released his second solo album in 1975 and also having joined the Rolling Stones (first as a temporary replacement for the departing [[Mick Taylor]], and later as a permanent member), as well as Stewart's own burgeoning solo career, it became impossible to maintain the Faces' as a viable band, so the Faces broke up at the end of the year.<ref name=\"tioos-chronicle75\">{{cite web|last=McPherson|first=Ian|title=The Rolling Stones Chronicle: 1975|url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/chron1975.html|access-date=14 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n===1975\u20131988: Height of fame and critical reaction===\n[[File:Rod-Stewart.jpg|thumb|upright|On stage in Dublin, 1981]]\nIn 1975, Stewart moved to Los Angeles. He released the ''[[Atlantic Crossing]]'' album for his new record company, using producer [[Tom Dowd]] and a different sound based on the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]]. ''Atlantic Crossing'' marked both a return to form and a return to the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' album charts. The first single, a cover of the [[Sutherland Brothers]] song \"[[Sailing (Sutherland Brothers song)|Sailing]]\", was a number-one hit in the UK, charted high in other European countries and in Australia, but only reached the Top 60 of the US and Canadian charts. The single returned to the UK Top 10 a year later when used as the theme music for a BBC documentary [[Sailor (TV series)|series]] about {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}}. Having been a hit twice over, \"Sailing\" became, and remains, Stewart's biggest-selling single in the UK. His [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]] cover \"[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)#Rod Stewart and Ronald Isley version|This Old Heart of Mine]]\" was also a Top 100 hit in 1976.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\"/> In 1976 Stewart covered [[The Beatles]]' song \"[[Get Back]]\" for the musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/all-this-and-world-war-ii-r230229/review|title=All This and World War II|website=AllMusic|access-date=4 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1976, Stewart topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for eight weeks and the Australian [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] chart with the ballad \"[[Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)|Tonight's the Night]]\", with an accompanying music video featuring actress [[Britt Ekland]].<ref name=\"BillboardChart\"/> It came from the ''[[A Night on the Town (Rod Stewart album)|A Night on the Town]]'' album, which went to number two on the ''Billboard'' album charts and was Stewart's first album to go platinum. By explicitly marking the album as having a \"fast side\" and a \"slow side\", Stewart continued the trend started by ''Atlantic Crossing''. \"[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]\", a cover of a [[Cat Stevens]] song, went number one in the UK in 1977, and top 30 in the US.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\"/><ref name=\"RockHall\"/> \"[[The Killing of Georgie]] (Part 1 and 2)\", about the murder of a gay man, was also a Top 40 hit for Stewart during 1977.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\"/>\n\n''[[Foot Loose & Fancy Free]]'' (1977) featured Stewart's own band, the original Rod Stewart Group that featured Carmine Appice, Phil Chen, Jim Cregan, Billy Peek, [[Gary Grainger]] and John Jarvis. It continued Stewart's run of chart success, reaching number two. \"[[You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)|You're in My Heart]]\" was the hit single, reaching number four in the US.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\"/>\n\n\"[[Hot Legs]]\" achieved a lot of radio airplay as did the confessional \"[[I Was Only Joking]]\". In appearance, Stewart's look had evolved to include a [[glam rock|glam]] element, including make-up and spandex clothes. Stewart scored another UK number one and US number one single with \"[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]\", which was a crossover hit reaching number five on the ''Billboard'' black charts due to its [[disco]] sound.<ref name=\"BillboardChart\"/> This was the lead single from 1978's ''[[Blondes Have More Fun]]'', which went to number one on the ''Billboard'' album charts and sold three million albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Rod+Stewart&ti=Blondes+Have+More+Fun|title=Recording Industry Association of America|website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] }}(RIAA)\u00ae</ref>\n\nA focal point of criticisms about this period was his biggest-selling 1978 disco hit \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\", which was atypical of his earlier output, and disparaged by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t4062480|pure_url=yes}}|author=Mason, Stewart|title=Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?|website=AllMusic}}</ref> In interviews, Stewart, while admitting his accompanying look had become \"tarty\", has defended the lyrics by pointing out that the song is a [[third-person narrative]] slice-of-life portrayal, not unlike those in his earlier work, and that it is not about him. The song's refrain was identical to Brazilian [[Jorge Ben Jor]]'s earlier \"Taj Mahal\" and a lawsuit ensued. Stewart donated his royalties from \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" to [[UNICEF]], and he performed it with his band at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1979.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nStewart moved to a more [[New wave music|new wave]] direction in 1980 by releasing the album ''Foolish Behaviour''. The album produced one hit single, \"[[Passion (Rod Stewart song)|Passion]]\", which reached No. 5 on the US ''Billboard'' Charts. In August 1981, MTV was launched in the US with several of Stewart's videos in heavy rotation. Later in 1981, Stewart added further elements of new wave and [[synthpop]] to his sound for the ''[[Tonight I'm Yours]]'' album.
