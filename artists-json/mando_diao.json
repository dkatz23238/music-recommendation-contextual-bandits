The band got their breakthrough with the release of the album ''[[Hurricane Bar]]''. Their main fan base is in Sweden, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan. Band members are [[Bj\u00f6rn Dixg\u00e5rd]] (vocals, guitar), [[Carl-Johan Fogelklou]] (bass), [[Jens Siverstedt]] (guitar), [[Daniel Haglund]] (keyboard) and [[Patrik Heinkipieti]] (drums).\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1999\u20132002)===\nThe roots of Mando Diao date back to 1999 when [[Bj\u00f6rn Dixg\u00e5rd]] (vocals, guitar) and  [[Daniel Haglund]] (keyboard) played in a band called Butler,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musikexpress.de/artists/article278268/mando-diao.html |title=Mando Diao - K\u00fcnstlerseite |website=Musikexpress.de |date=2011-11-25 |access-date=2012-12-16}}</ref> which they had founded in the middle of the 1990s. In 1996, [[Gustaf Nor\u00e9n]] (vocals, guitar), joined the band. In 1999, [[Carl-Johan Fogelklou]] (bass, backing vocals) and [[Samuel Giers]] (drums) became members and completed the original band. The current line-up decided to take the project more seriously. Bj\u00f6rn Dixg\u00e5rd and Gustaf Nor\u00e9n locked themselves up in a summer house and spent 14 months writing songs. They claim the [[Beatles]] as their original source of inspiration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/Mando-Diao |title=Mando Diao \u2013 laut.de \u2013 Band |website=Laut.de |access-date=2012-12-16}}</ref> Allegedly, Gustaf joined the band after he and Bj\u00f6rn had talked all night about this band.

A local writer described them in an article as the best unsigned band he had ever seen. This was soon followed by a record deal with [[EMI]] Sweden.\n\n===First breakthrough (2002\u201305)===\nThe release of their debut album ''[[Bring 'Em In (Mando Diao album)|Bring 'Em In]]'' in 2002, and of their first single \"[[Sheepdog (song)|Sheepdog]]\" made the band popular in Sweden; the 1960s and 1970s music style and sound as well as the singers\u00b4 voices were soon seen as the \"typical\" Mando Diao sound by their fans. Gustaf Nor\u00e9n once compared ''Bring 'Em In'' to music by [[The Kooks]], the [[Small Faces]] and [[The Kinks]], declaring his band's music best and even better than many albums by [[The Beatles]] or [[The Rolling Stones]].<br>\nThe band began touring Sweden and other Scandinavian countries together with local bands as [[The Hellacopters]] or [[Kent (band)|Kent]].\n\nDaniel Haglund left the band in 2003, due to some minor disputes, and was replaced by [[Mats Bj\u00f6rke]].\n\n===International success (2005\u201311)===\nWith every album release, the band's international success increased; in 2007 Mando Diao appeared for the first time as headliner on a music festival, the [[Live Earth]] concert in Hamburg.\n\nAfter the recording of ''Above And Beyond - MTV unplugged'', Samuel Giers left the band at the beginning of 2011. Since September 2011, Mando Diao is supported by [[Patrik Heikinpieti]] (drums) and Daniel Haglund (guitar, keyboard).\n\n===Swedish album ''Infruset'' (2012)===\nIn 2011, Gustaf Nor\u00e9n and Bj\u00f6rn Dixg\u00e5rd began working on poems written by the Swedish poet [[Gustaf Fr\u00f6ding]], and setting them to music.
