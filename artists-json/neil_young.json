Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group \u2013 winners of the 1969 [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist Grammy Award]] \u2013 was renamed [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=313}} The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous [[Woodstock Festival]], during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: \"One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=318\u2013320}} During the making of their first album, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he \"wanted to play folk music in a rock band.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=324}} Despite the tension, Young's tenure with CSNY coincided with the band's most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist.\n\nYoung wrote \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\" following the [[Kent State massacre]] on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's \"Teach Your Children\" was still climbing the singles charts.\n\n===''After the Gold Rush'', acoustic tour and ''Harvest'' (1970\u20131972)===\nLater in the year, Young released his third solo album, ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, [[Nils Lofgren]], [[Stephen Stills]], and CSNY bassist [[Greg Reeves]]. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than ''Everybody Knows This is Nowhere'', with a wider range of sounds. Young's newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best known work, including \"[[Tell Me Why (Neil Young song)|Tell Me Why]]\" and \"[[Don't Let It Bring You Down]]\"; the singles \"[[Only Love Can Break Your Heart]]\" and \"[[When You Dance I Can Really Love]]\"; and the title track, \"[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]\", played on piano, with dreamlike lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]]. Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\" (along with a later song entitled \"Alabama\") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit \"[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]].\" However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man [[Ronnie Van Zant]] was later photographed wearing a ''Tonight's the Night'' T-shirt on the cover of [[Street Survivors|an album]].\n\n[[File:Neil Young-early promo.jpg|thumb|Young in the 1970s|left]]\n\nIn the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and a number of new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like \"Journey through the Past\", would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like \"See the Sky About to Rain\", would only be released in coming years. With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young's tour, now entitled Journey Through the Past, continued into early 1971, and its focus shifted more to newer songs he had been writing; he famously remarked that having written so many, he could not think of anything to do but play them. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto's [[Massey Hall]], which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, and the recordings were officially released nearly 40 years later as an official bootleg in Young's [[Neil Young Archives|Archive]] series.\n\nNear the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash]]'' TV show. \"[[The Needle and the Damage Done]]\", a somber lament on the pain caused by [[heroin addiction]], had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member [[Danny Whitten]], who eventually died while battling his drug problems.{{sfn|Williamson|2002|p=42}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=279}} While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of [[Quadrafonic Sound Studios]] owner [[Elliot Mazer]] to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute. Making a connection with them, he christened them [[The Stray Gators]], and began playing with them. Befitting the immediacy of the project, [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]] were brought in from the Cash taping to do background vocals. Against the advice of his producer [[David Briggs (producer)|David Briggs]], he scrapped plans for the imminent release<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bad-news-beat.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1889 |title=Neil comments on massey hall release :: Bad News Beat :: on Neil Young |website=Bad-news-beat.org |access-date=July 11, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010740/http://www.bad-news-beat.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1889 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref> of the live acoustic recording in favor of a studio album consisting of the Nashville sessions, electric-guitar oriented sessions recorded later in his barn, and two recordings made with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at Barking (credited as Barking Town Hall and now the [[The Broadway (theatre)|Broadway Theatre]]) during March 1971.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.longlivevinyl.net/classic-album-neil-young-harvest/ |title=Classic Album: Neil Young \u2013 Harvest|date=June 2, 2017 |work=Long Live Vinyl |access-date=October 10, 2017 |language=en-GB}}</ref> The result was Young's fourth album, ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (February 14, 1972), which was also the best selling album of 1972 in the US.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1972/top-billboard-200-albums|title=Billboard Year End 1972|magazine=Billboard|date=January 2, 2013|access-date=September 15, 2021}}</ref> The only remnant left of the original live concept was the album's live acoustic performance of \"Needle and the Damage Done.\"\n\nAfter his success with CSNY, Young purchased a ranch in the rural hills above Woodside and Redwood City in Northern California (\"Broken Arrow Ranch\", where he lived until his divorce in 2014).<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-neil-youngs-nature-themed-opus-20160705|title=Inside Neil Young's Nature-Themed Opus|website=Rollingstone.com|date=July 5, 2016|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref> He wrote the song \"[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]\" in honor of the land's longtime caretaker, Louis Avila.

Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'' (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described \"Heart of Gold\" as the song that \"put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\"<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Decade |chapter=Heart of Gold |title-link=Decade (Neil Young album) |first=Neil |last=Young |author-link=Neil Young |date=1977 |type=liner notes |publisher=Warner Bros.}}</ref>\n\n===The \"Ditch\" Trilogy and personal struggles (1972\u20131974)===\nAlthough a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of ''Harvest'', it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent [[alcohol overdose|alcohol]]/[[diazepam]] overdose. Young described the incident to ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]] in 1975: \"[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd OD'd. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409205354/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 9, 2006|title=Neil Young: The RS Interview|magazine=Rollingstone.com|access-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer [[Kenny Buttrey]], a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the [[hard rock]] milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer [[Johnny Barbata]], while [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as \"[his] least favorite record\", and was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young's [[Neil Young Archives#Official Release Series 05:|Official Release Series]]). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. ''Time Fades Away'', for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. ''Time'' was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the \"Ditch Trilogy\", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of ''Harvest''.<ref name=\"UnCut\">{{cite news|last=Pinnock|first=Tom|title=Neil Young's 'Time Fades Away': 'Harvest's unlikely follow-up|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/neil-young/neil-young-s-time-fades-away-harvests-unlikely-follow-up-feature|access-date=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=May 2010|issue=156}}</ref> These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young's inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time.\n\n[[File:Neil Young in Austin, 1976.jpg|thumb|Young in [[Austin, Texas]], on November 9, 1976]]\n\nIn the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by [[Nils Lofgren]] on guitar and piano and ''Harvest''/''Time Fades Away'' veteran [[Ben Keith]] on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and [[roadie]] [[Bruce Berry (roadie)|Bruce Berry]], Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (June 20, 1975). The album's dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay its release and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would do so.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=430}} While his record company was stalling, Young recorded another album, ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'' (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song \"See the Sky About to Rain\", but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like ''Time Fades Away'', it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young's most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of ''On the Beach'' described the music as \"mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary\".<ref name=\"sven\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com/a&e/soundfury904.htm |title=Neil Young \u2013 On the Beach (Reprise) |newspaper=The Santa Barbara Independent |date=March 18, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040421143346/http://www.independent.com/a%26e/soundfury904.htm |archive-date=April 21, 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter completing ''On the Beach'', Young reunited with ''Harvest'' producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, ''[[Homegrown (Neil Young album)|Homegrown]]''. Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though ''Homegrown'' was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, ''Tonight's the Night'', at the suggestion of [[The Band|Band]] bassist [[Rick Danko]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Young further explained his move by saying: \"It was a little too personal ... it scared me\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Most of the songs from ''Homegrown'' were later incorporated into other Young albums while the original album was not released until 2020. ''Tonight's the Night,'' when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the \"ditch\" trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=433}}\n\n===Reunions, retrospectives and ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1974\u20131979)===\nYoung reunited with [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour which was partially recorded; highlights were ultimately released in 2014 as ''[[CSNY 1974]]''. It was one of the first ever stadium tours, and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=452}}\n\nIn 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with [[Frank Sampedro]] on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, ''[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]'' (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; \"[[Cortez the Killer]]\", a retelling of the [[Spanish conquest]] of Mexico from the viewpoint of the [[Aztec]]s, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. ''Zuma''{{'}}s closing track, \"Through My Sails\", was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album.\n\nIn 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (September 20, 1976), credited to [[The Stills-Young Band]]; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a [[telegram]] that read: \"Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=502}}\n\n[[File:The Last Waltz.jpg|thumb|''The Last Waltz'', Young (center on left microphone) performing with Bob Dylan and [[The Band]], among others in 1976|left]]\n\nIn 1976, Young performed with Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and numerous other rock musicians in the high-profile all-star concert ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', the final performance by [[The Band]]. The release of [[Martin Scorsese]]'s movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of \"[[Helpless (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Helpless]]\".<ref name=\"Exclaim\">{{cite magazine|last=Schneider|first=Jason|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid1=1741|title=Neil Young \u2013 Searching for a Heart of Gold|date=August 4, 2003|magazine=Exclaim!|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030901150951/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid1=1741|archive-date=September 1, 2003}}</ref> ''[[American Stars 'n Bars]]'' (June 13, 1977) contained two songs originally recorded for the ''Homegrown'' album, \"Homegrown\" and \"Star of Bethlehem\", as well as newer material, including the future concert staple \"[[Like a Hurricane (Neil Young song)|Like a Hurricane]]\". Performers on the record included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Emmylou Harris]] and Young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Nicolette Larson]] along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'', a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits.\n\n''[[Comes a Time]]'' (October 2, 1978), Young's first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, marked a return to the commercially accessible, Nashville-inspired sound of ''Harvest'' while also featuring contributions from Larson and Crazy Horse. The album also marked a return to his folk roots, as exemplified by a cover of [[Ian Tyson]]'s \"[[Four Strong Winds]]\", a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada. Another of the album's songs, \"[[Lotta Love]]\", was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in February 1979. In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young's film ''[[Human Highway]]'', which took its name from a song featured on ''Comes a Time''. Over four years, Young would spend US$3,000,000 of his own money on production (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000000|1978}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the [[art punk]] band [[Devo]], whose members appeared in the film.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=575\u2013577}}\n\nYoung set out in 1978 on the lengthy ''Rust Never Sleeps'' tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of playing, were influenced by the [[punk rock]] [[zeitgeist]] of the late 1970s and provided a stark contrast from ''Comes a Time''.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=529\u2013537}} Two new songs, the acoustic \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]\" and electric \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" were the centerpiece of the new material. During the filming of ''Human Highway'', Young had collaborated with Devo on a cacophonous version of \"Hey Hey, My My\" at the [[Different Fur]] studio in San Francisco and would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The lyric \"It's better to burn out than to fade away\" was widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The album has also widely been considered a precursor of [[grunge]] music and many grunge artists have said they were inspired by Young's distorted guitars on the B side to this album. Young also compared the rise of [[Johnny Rotten]] with that of the recently deceased \"King\" [[Elvis Presley]], who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an [[Pop icon|icon]]. Rotten returned the favor by playing one of Young's songs, \"Revolution Blues\" from ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'', on a London radio show, an early sign of Young's eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Martin|title=DJ Johnny Rotten plays music from his own record collection on the radio, 1977|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/dj_johnny_rotten_plays_music_from_his_own_record_collection_on_the_radio_19|website=Dangerousminds.net|date=June 16, 2016|access-date=April 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nYoung's two accompanying albums ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (July 2, 1979; new material culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and ''[[Live Rust]]'' (November 19, 1979; a genuine concert recording featuring old and new material) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\". Young worked with rock artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] to create the poster art for the film, using the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Jawas]] as a theme. Young's work since ''Harvest'' had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of ''Rolling Stone'' voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with [[The Who]]), selected ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rolling.htm#1979 |title=Albums Of The Year And End Of Year Critic Lists |publisher=Rocklist.net |access-date=February 5, 2020 }}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' named ''Rust Never Sleeps'' as the year's second best album in the [[Pazz & Jop]] Poll, a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.

The album was finally released in an altered form midway through 1985. Young also appeared at that year's [[Live Aid]] concert in [[Philadelphia]], collaborating with Crosby, Stills and Nash for the quartet's first performance for a paying audience in over ten years.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nYoung's last two albums for Geffen were more conventional in the genre, although they incorporated production techniques like synthesizers and echoing drums that were previously uncommon in Young's music. Young recorded 1986's ''[[Landing on Water]]'' without Crazy Horse but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, ''[[Life (1987 album)|Life]]'', which emerged in 1987. Young's album sales dwindled steadily throughout the eighties; today ''Life'' remains his all-time-least successful studio album, with an estimated four hundred thousand sales worldwide.<ref>As of June 2008 {{cite web|title=Neil Young Worldwide Album Sales Estimates|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/communaute/index.php?showtopic=6523&gopid=969589&#entry969589|date=June 14, 2008|access-date=April 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSwitching back to his old label Reprise Records, Young continued to tour relentlessly, assembling a new blues band called The Bluenotes in mid-1987 (a legal dispute with musician [[Harold Melvin]] forced the eventual rechristening of the band as Ten Men Working midway through the tour). The addition of a [[brass section]] provided a new [[jazz]]ier sound, and the title track of 1988's ''[[This Note's For You]]'' became Young's first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and [[Michael Jackson]], the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, \"What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?\" Despite this, the video was eventually named [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|best video of the year]] by the network in 1989.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=24\u201332}}\n\nYoung reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash to record the 1988 album ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\nYoung attracted criticism from liberals in the music industry when he supported [[President Ronald Reagan]] and said he was \"tired of people constantly apologising for being Americans\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Campbell|date=April 29, 2006|title=Neil Young: The conscience of America|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/apr/30/popandrock.neilyoung|access-date=February 8, 2022|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en}}</ref> In a 1985 interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'', he said about the [[AIDS pandemic]]: \u201cYou go to a supermarket and you see a faggot behind the fuckin' cash register, you don't want him to handle your potatoes.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite magazine|date=March 20, 2013|title=Michelle shocked: not the first artist to betray her fanbase|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/michelle-shocked-not-the-first-artist-to-betray-her-fanbase-87622/|access-date=February 8, 2022|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|language=en-US}}</ref> In the same interview, Young also complained about [[Social programs in the United States|welfare]] beneficiaries, saying: \"Stop being supported by the government and get out and work.

The album's lyrics were often overtly political; \"Rockin' in the Free World\" deals with homelessness, terrorism, and environmental degradation, implicitly criticizing the government policies of President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Young Lyrics Analysis: Rockin' in the Free World|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/fot/ritfw.htm|website=Thrasherswheat.org|access-date=April 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe use of heavy [[feedback]] and distortion on several ''Freedom'' tracks was reminiscent of the ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) album and foreshadowed the imminent rise of grunge. The rising stars of the subgenre, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Eddie Vedder]], frequently cited Young as a major influence, contributing to his popular revival. A tribute album called ''[[The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young]]'' was released in 1989, featuring covers by a range of alternative and grunge acts, including [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Dinosaur Jr]], and the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]].\n\nYoung's 1990 album ''[[Ragged Glory]]'', recorded with Crazy Horse in a barn on his [[Northern California]] ranch, continued this distortion-heavy aesthetic. Young toured for the album with Orange County, California country-punk band [[Social Distortion]] and Sonic Youth as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans.<ref name=\"sonic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/jammin/sonic_youth.htm|title=Sonic Youth and Neil Young|publisher=Thrasher's Wheat \u2013 A Neil Young Archives|access-date=April 1, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Weld (album)|Weld]]'', a two-disc live album documenting the tour, was released in 1991.<ref name=\"sonic\" /> Sonic Youth's influence was evident on ''[[Arc (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Arc]]'', a 35-minute collage of feedback and distortion spliced together at the suggestion of [[Thurston Moore]] and originally packaged with some versions of ''Weld''.<ref name=\"sonic\" />\n\n1992's ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' marked an abrupt return (prompted by Young's [[hyperacusis]] in the aftermath of the ''Weld'' tour) to the country and folk-rock stylings of ''Harvest'' and reunited him with some of the musicians from that album, including the core members of the Stray Gators and singers [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]]. The title track was a minor hit, and the record was well received by critics, winning the [[Juno Award for Album of the Year]] in 1994. Young also contributed to lifelong friend [[Randy Bachman]]'s nostalgic 1992 tune \"Prairie Town\", and garnered a 1993 [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award]] nomination for his song \"Philadelphia\", from the soundtrack of the [[Jonathan Demme]] movie [[Philadelphia (movie)|of the same name]]. An ''[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with [[Booker T. and the M.G.s]] for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with [[Blues Traveler]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Pearl Jam]] also on the bill. Some European shows ended with a rendition of \"Rockin' in the Free World\" played with [[Pearl Jam]], foreshadowing their eventual full-scale collaboration two years later.\n\n[[File:Neil Young, Heart of Gold.jpg|thumb|Young on stage in [[Barcelona]]]]\n\nIn 1994, Young again collaborated with Crazy Horse for ''[[Sleeps with Angels]]'', a record whose dark, somber mood was influenced by [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death earlier that year: the title track in particular dealt with Cobain's life and death, without mentioning him by name. Cobain had quoted Young's lyric \"It's better to burn out than fade away\" (a line from \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)|My My, Hey Hey]]\") in [[Death of Kurt Cobain#Suicide note|his suicide note]].

Young's instrumental soundtrack was improvized while he watched the film alone in a studio. The death of longtime mentor, friend, and producer [[David Briggs (producer)|David Briggs]] in late 1995 prompted Young to reconnect with Crazy Horse the following year for the album and tour ''[[Broken Arrow (album)|Broken Arrow]]''. A Jarmusch-directed concert film and live album of the tour, ''[[Year of the Horse]]'', emerged in 1997. From 1996 to 1997 Young and Crazy Horse toured extensively throughout Europe and North America, including a stint as part of the [[H.O.R.D.E.]] Festival's sixth annual tour.\n\nIn 1998, Young renewed his collaboration with the rock band [[Phish]], sharing the stage at the annual [[Farm Aid]] concert and then at Young's Bridge School Benefit, where he joined headliners Phish for renditions of \"[[Helpless (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Helpless]]\" and \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperrust.org/Bridge/Bridge12.html|title=Bridge Benefit XII|publisher=Hyperrust|access-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Phish declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on his 1999 North American tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\nThe decade ended with the release in late 1999 of ''[[Looking Forward]]'', another reunion with Crosby, Stills, and Nash.

They include:\na late 1950s [[Gretsch White Falcon]] purchased by Young near the end of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] era. In 1969, he bought a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stephen Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early 1970s period, and can be heard on tracks like \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\", \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", \"Alabama\", \"Words (Between the Lines of Age)\", and \"L.A.\". It was Young's primary electric guitar during the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) era, since Young's deteriorating back condition (eventually fixed with surgery) made playing the much heavier Les Paul (a favourite of his named [[Old Black]]) difficult.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=David|last=Simons|title=Recording Harvest: The Making of Neil Young's Classic 1972 Album|magazine=Acoustic Guitar|issue=103|date=July 2001|pages=38\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Reed organ===\nYoung owns a restored [[Estey Organ|Estey]] [[reed organ]], serial number 167272, dating from 1885, which he frequently plays in concert.<ref>''The Reed Society Quarterly'' (30.1: 6ff)</ref>\n\n===Crystallophone===\nYoung owns a [[glass harmonica]], which he played in the recording of \"I Do\" on his 2019 album ''[[Colorado (Neil Young album)|Colorado]]''.<ref>Mountaintop Sessions</ref>\n\n===Amplification===\nYoung uses various vintage [[Fender Tweed Deluxe]] [[amplifier]]s. His preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. He purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for US$50 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1967}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from Sol Betnun Music on Larchmont in Hollywood and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it is the original model that sounds superior and is crucial to his trademark sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/ptma/equip.htm|title=Neil Young's Equipment|publisher=Thrasherswheat.org|date=August 31, 1996|access-date=November 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950s [[Magnatone]] 280 (similar to the amplifier used by [[Lonnie Mack]] and [[Buddy Holly]]). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in an unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities. It can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on \"See the Sky About to Rain\". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an [[effects pedal]]. Tom Wheeler's book Soul of Tone highlights the device on page 182/183.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/randybachman|title=BBC documentary Neil Young: Don't Be Denied \u2013 Randy Bachmann interviews|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Neil Young discography and filmography}}\n{{see also|Crazy Horse (band)#Discography|Buffalo Springfield#Discography|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young discography}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* ''[[Neil Young (album)|Neil Young]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]'' with Crazy Horse (1969)\n* ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (1970)\n* ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' (1973, live)\n* ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]'' with Crazy Horse (1975)\n* ''[[Long May You Run]]'' with Stephen Stills (1976)\n* ''[[American Stars 'n Bars]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Comes a Time]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' with Crazy Horse (1979, live)\n* ''[[Live Rust]]'' with Crazy Horse (1979, live)\n* ''[[Hawks & Doves]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Re\u00b7ac\u00b7tor]]'' with Crazy Horse (1981)\n* ''[[Trans (album)|Trans]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Everybody's Rockin']]'' with the Shocking Pinks (1983)\n* ''[[Old Ways]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Landing on Water]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Life (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Life]]'' with Crazy Horse (1987, live)\n* ''[[This Note's for You]]'' with The Bluenotes (1988)\n* ''[[Freedom (Neil Young album)|Freedom]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[Ragged Glory]]'' with Crazy Horse (1990)\n* ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Sleeps with Angels]]'' with Crazy Horse (1994)\n* ''[[Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)|Mirror Ball]]'' with Pearl Jam (1995)\n* ''[[Broken Arrow (album)|Broken Arrow]]'' with Crazy Horse (1996)\n* ''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Are You Passionate?]]'' with Booker T. & the M.G.'s (2002)\n* ''[[Greendale (album)|Greendale]]'' with Crazy Horse (2003)\n* ''[[Prairie Wind]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Living with War]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Living with War: \"In the Beginning\"]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Chrome Dreams II]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Fork in the Road]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Le Noise]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Americana (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Americana]]'' with Crazy Horse (2012)\n* ''[[Psychedelic Pill]]'' with Crazy Horse (2012)\n* ''[[A Letter Home]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Storytone]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[The Monsanto Years]]'' with Promise of the Real (2015)\n* ''[[Peace Trail (Neil Young album)|Peace Trail]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Earth (Neil Young album)|Earth]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Hitchhiker (Neil Young album)|Hitchhiker]]'' recorded 1976 (2017)\n* ''[[The Visitor (Neil Young & Promise of the Real album)|The Visitor]]'' with Promise of the Real (2017)\n* ''[[Colorado (Neil Young album)|Colorado]]'' with Crazy Horse (2019)\n* ''[[Homegrown (Neil Young album)|Homegrown]]'' recorded 1974\u201375 (2020)\n* ''[[Barn (album)|Barn]]'' with Crazy Horse (2021)\n* ''[[Toast (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Toast]]'' with Crazy Horse; recorded 2001 (2022)\n* ''[[Noise & Flowers]]'' with Promise of the Real; recorded 2019 (2022, live)\n* ''[[World Record (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|World Record]]'' with Crazy Horse (2022)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Legacy and awards==\n[[File:Neil Young Star cropped.jpg|thumb|Young's star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]]]]As one of the original founders of [[Farm Aid]] (1985\u2013), he remains an active member of the board of directors.

(magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine compiled a \"Greatest Living Songwriters\" list, Young was ranked second behind [[Bob Dylan]]. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other's records). He ranked thirty-ninth on ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock'' that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has \"avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young's peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill.\"<ref name=\"rockhall.com\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Acclaimed Music]], Young is the seventh-most celebrated artist in popular music history.<ref name=\"Acclaimed Music\"/>\n\n''[[After the Gold Rush]]'', ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'', ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', and \"[[Ohio (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Ohio]]\" have all been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grammy Hall of Fame List|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/hall-of-fame|access-date=December 11, 2021|work=Grammys|date=October 18, 2010}}</ref>\n\nYoung's political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as [[Blind Melon]], [[Phish]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Young is referred to as \"the Godfather of [[Grunge]]\" because of the influence he had on [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Eddie Vedder]] and the entire grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. Young is cited as being a significant influence on the [[experimental rock]] group [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]]. Yorke recounted of first hearing Young after sending a demo tape into a magazine when he was 16, who favorably compared his singing voice to Young's. Unaware of Young at that time, he bought ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (1970), and \"immediately fell in love\" with his work, calling it \"extraordinary\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/thomyorke/|title=BBC \u2013 Neil Young: Don't be denied. \u2013 Video \u2013 Thom Yorke|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian rock group [[Powderfinger]] named themselves after Young's song \"[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]\" from ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979).
