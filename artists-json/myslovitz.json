The band take their name from their industrial hometown of [[Mys\u0142owice]] in the [[Upper Silesia]] region of southern Poland.\n\n==Band history==\nGuitarist and vocalist [[Artur Rojek]] started the band in 1992 as \"'''The Freshmen'''\", taking the initial name from the 1990 film ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]]'', starring [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Matthew Broderick]], indicating a fascination with cinema that would become a characteristic feature throughout the band's career. In 1994 they changed their name to Myslovitz. The band's early phase was characterised by a somewhat debonair [[punk rock|punk]] attitude, as Rojek admits:\n:''\"I started Myslovitz in 1992. I was twenty then and I had no idea how to make good music. Surely, I was a big fan of a few British groups ([[Ride (band)|Ride]], [[The Stone Roses|Stone Roses]], [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Housemartins]]) but I couldn't play the guitar at all. After several months of rehearsals [\u2026] I decided that I should cover the holes in my musical education by [\u2026] chaos (the bigger the better).\"'' [http://www.myslovitz.pl/fankluby_ang.php]\n\nEven so, they soon caught the media's attention, winning several important competitions for young musicians. This enabled them to make their first professional recordings in the studio of Radio Lodz. In 1994, Myslovitz were signed by MJM Music Pl and recorded their self-titled debut album with British producer Ian Harris, who had previously worked for, amongst others, [[Joy Division]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], and [[The Exploited]]. Upon its release in 1995, the album received euphoric reviews and was declared \"Debut of the Year\" by several music magazines. Some critics compared it to [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who were at the peak of their popularity at that time.\n\nIn 1996, Myslovitz were joined by a third guitarist and keyboarder, Przemek Myszor, and released the second album ''Sun Machine'' on [[Sony Music]] Polska. The album spawned two somewhat [[beatles]]que airplay hits - ''Z twarz\u0105 Marilyn Monroe'' (\"With a Face Like...\") and ''Peggy Brown'', the latter being a cover version of a fellow Mys\u0142owice rock band, with lyrics originally by the Irish \"national bard\" [[Turlough O'Carolan]] (in a translation by the Polish lyricist and translator Ernest Bryll).\n\nThe following year, the third album ''Z rozmy\u015bla\u0144 przy \u015bniadaniu'' (\"From meditations over breakfast\") was released, displaying a tendency towards a more \"polished\" sound and more introspective lyrics. Also, Myslovitz's now typical fascination with cinema began to take centre stage with numerous allusions and hints in the lyrics and track titles, and a certain \"cinematic\" atmosphere in the music itself.\n\nThe band's interest in cinema also showed in their contributions to soundtracks. In 1998, they recorded the unconventional track ''To nie by\u0142 film'' (\"That was no film\") for the Polish movie ''M\u0142ode wilki \u00bd'' (\"Young Wolves \u00bd\"). The lyrics referred to a wave of violent crimes committed by juvenile delinquents, which was controversially discussed in Polish mass media in the mid-1990s. The explicit depiction of violence in the lyrics and the accompanying [[video clip]] (which later won a [[Fryderyk]] award as \"Video of the Year\") caused further controversy and led Polish broadcasting networks to boycott both the song and the clip.\n\nAlso in 1998, Myslovitz had their first appearances abroad with shows in [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], and the [[United States]].\n\nThe final breakthrough for the band came in 1999 with their fourth album entitled ''Mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 w czasach popkultury'' (\"Love in The Time of [[Pop Culture]]\"), which went platinum (i.e. 150,000 copies sold) soon and has by now achieved \"double platinum\" status in Poland. The single ''D\u0142ugo\u015b\u0107 dzwi\u0119ku samotno\u015bci'' (\"[The Length of the] Sound of Solitude\") became the biggest hit for the band so far.\n\nIn 2000 Myslovitz again contributed to soundtracks, writing and recording the song ''Polowanie na wielb\u0142\u0105da'' (\"Camel Hunting\") for the movie ''[[The Big Animal]]'' (''Du\u017ce zwierz\u0119'') by the legendary Polish actor and director [[Jerzy Stuhr]], and the single plus another two (previously unreleased) tracks to director Waldemar Szarek's movie \"That's Us\" (''To my''). In 2003 Myslovitz continued their cooperation with Stuhr, creating not only the title song for his movie \"Tomorrow's Weather\", but also appearing in walk-on roles - as neophyte monks.\n\nIn 2002, the follow-up to ''Mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107...'', entitled ''Korova Milky Bar'' appeared; the title being an allusion to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s classic screen version of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Strikingly, the melancholic elements took over almost completely, with both music and (sometimes sarcastic) lyrics creating an overall downcast mood. Nonetheless, the album sold even more copies than its predecessor had in the same amount of time, with the singles ''Acidland'' and ''Sprzedawcy marze\u0144'' (\"Dreamsellers\") repeating the success of ''D\u0142ugo\u015b\u0107...'' three years earlier.\n\nThe reason for the new material's popularity, as some critics surmised, was that its atmosphere closely conformed to a presumed resignative-recessive mood within Polish society at large - which guitarist Przemek Myszor seemed to confirm in an interview for the ''Montreal Mirror'': ''\"For us, the Korova Milky Bar'' [from Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange'] ''is a place where something different may happen to your mind. It's a place like today's Poland. You know, Poland is a place where very strange things happen to your mind. It's a country full of crisis and everything around you is very sad, very dark, very fucked. There is an economic crisis here. People don't have money, politics are fucked. The lyrics on our record are sad because of this. We sing a lot about being in a strange state of mind\" [http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2002/112802/music2.html].\n\nWith ''Korova Milky Bar'', Myslovitz appeared at several festivals throughout Europe, including the big, traditional German festival for Alternative acts (''Bizarre'') and the prestigious [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Also, they supported [[Iggy Pop]] and the [[Simple Minds]] on their European tours that year. Also, they received an [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] in [[Barcelona]] for ''Best Polish Act'', having been nominated twice in previous years.\n\nIn November 2002 Myslovitz signed a new contract with [[EMI]]'s Polish outlet Pomaton. The first album to be released on the new label was an English-language re-recording of ''Korova Milky Bar'', which was released in 27 countries (including Germany, the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]] and [[South Africa]]). In addition to the ''Korova...'' material, this version also included English versions of older tracks. \n\"D\u0142ugo\u015b\u0107 dzwi\u0119ku samotno\u015bci\" now became a single as \"The Sound of Solitude\"' (an earlier English version, somewhat awkwardly but more correctly entitled \"The Length of The Solitude Sound\", had been a Polish b-side). A video clip for this song was directed [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]], the Polish Hollywood cinematographer who had won [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] with ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', and had declined an offer from [[Martin Scorsese]] in order to work with Myslovitz. Kaminski declares himself a \"fan\" of Myslovitz, saying ''\"I only work for [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] and Myslovitz [...] Money is not a factor in this. What one doesn't do for one's idols!\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20050416200128/http://myslovitz.xon.pl/a119.htm]'' The clip got frequent plays on MTV Europe and the album received positive reviews in the European music press, particularly in Germany. However, radio airplay was sporadic and largely limited to Alternative  programmes (such as [[John Peel]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]), as a consequence, Myslovitz so far failed to enter the upper reaches of the charts outside Poland.\n\nAlso in 2003, Myslovitz performed with [[Travis (band)|Travis]] and Skin (of [[Skunk Anansie]] fame) on ''The Road to [[Edinburgh]]'', where they received another MTV Europe Music Award for ''Best Polish Act''.\n\nThe same year, Sony Music domestically released an obligatory end-of-contract compilation album, entitled ''The Best of''. The lead single ''Krak\u00f3w'' was an older song re-recorded with 1970s Polish [[folk rock]] stars [[Marek Grechuta]] and Anawa.\n\nIn the summer of 2004 Myslovitz were touring Europe again, starting with a concert for the German public radio and television broadcaster [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] on the eve of [[Enlargement of the European Union|EU enlargement]]. Apart from headlining smaller venues and playing festival slots (including the largest Swiss open-air event in [[St. Gallen]], they again opened for [[Iggy Pop]] & [[The Stooges]] on their European dates, as well as for [[Borrowed Heaven Tour|The Corrs]] in the UK and  mainland Europe.\n\nIn December 2004, EMI released Myslovitz's most recent album entitled ''Skalary, mieczyki, neonki'' (\"Angelfish, swordtails, neon tetras\") - an out-of-schedule release with outtakes from the ''Korova Milky Bar'' recording sessions; longform, psychedelic-experimental and downbeat instrumental soundscapes took center stage. ''Skalary...'' earned Myslovitz comparisons to [[Radiohead]] and [[Pink Floyd]].\n\nAt the time, the band had finished recording of their new album ''[[Happiness Is Easy]]''; it was released in May 2006.\n\nMyslovitz's success arguably contributed to a revitalisation of the Polish alternative rock scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which spawned bands such as ''eM'', ''Kombajn do zbierania kur po wioskach'', and ''Lili Marlene''.\n\nIn April 2012, frontman and co-founder [[Artur Rojek]] left the band after twenty years to pursue a solo career and continue work as creative director for the annual [[Off Festival|OFF Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allaboutmusic.pl/artur-rojek-opuszcza-myslovitz/|title=Artur Rojek opuszcza Myslovitz!

When choosing their name, the band seemed to be inspired by an ambiguous relationship towards their hometown which they felt to be rather provincial. In a review of ''The Best of...'', the liberal Catholic weekly ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' stated that ''\"coming from Mys\u0142owice, the band entered the new, wonderful world of show business with a small-town complex\"''[https://web.archive.org/web/20041001022407/http://muzyka.onet.pl/mr,23699,1,recenzje.html]. In an interview with the ''Montreal Mirror'' (see above), Guitarist Przemek Myszor called Mys\u0142owice ''\"depressing\" [...] like all small towns are. In Poland there are few big towns. And by big town I mean where there is culture. You know, towns that have big clubs. We still live in Mys\u0142owice, but this is a city to die in, not to live. Our region of Poland, in the south, is very industrial, coal mining, hard industry\"'' [http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2002/112802/music2.html].\nFor statements like these, Myslovitz were sometimes chided for fouling their own nest; paradoxically, however, they even helped to sanitize the city's image. Says the music journalist Leszek Gnoi\u0144ski (author of the \"standard work\" ''Encyklopedia Polskiego Rocka''): ''\"Mys\u0142owice is a city of some 100,000 people. Until the early 90s, it was known, at best, for its coalmines - until these five guys with guitars turned the mining town into a place that could be located on any map of Poland.\"'' Myslovitz's impact was one factor which stimulated the development of a local music scene. By now, with bands such as ''[[Negatyw]]'' and ''Supermusic'', a lively Alternative rock and [[hip hop culture]] is flourishing in Mys\u0142owice. Far away from [[Warsaw]] as the centre of the commercial Polish entertainment industry, it even benefits from its image as being peripheral, obscure, and non-commercial - not totally unlike the British [[Madchester]] phenomenon in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n==Awards==\n*Apart from numerous accolades awarded by Polish music magazines and radio stations, Myslovitz received the weekly ''[[Polityka]]'''s prestigious ''Paszport'' in the category \"Pop/Rock/Entertainment\" in 1999; in 2000 the Polish ''[[Playboy]]'' declared ''D\u0142ugo\u015b\u0107 Dzwi\u0119ku Samotno\u015bci'' and Myslovitz \"Song of The Year\" and \"Band of The Year\" respectively, whereas the Polish issue of ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' declared them the \"most stylish stars in music\".\n*Myslovitz were frequently nominated for [[Fryderyk]]s (the Polish equivalent of the [[BRIT Awards|BRIT Award]] or the [[Grammy]]) in various categories. In total, they received seven Fryderyk awards - in 1998 for \"Music Video of The Year\" (for ''To nie by\u0142 film''/\"It wasn't a movie\" - see above), in 1999 for \"Band of The Year\" and \"Rock Album of The Year\" (for ''D\u0142ugo\u015b\u0107 Dzwi\u0119ku Samotno\u015bci''/\"Length of the sound of solitude\"), in 2000 for \"Song of The Year\" (for ''Ch\u0142opcy''/\"(Town) Boys\") and \"Video of The Year\" (for ''Dla Ciebie''/\"For You\"), and in 2003 for \"Album of The Year (for ''Korova Milky Bar'').\n*After two nominations in previous years, Myslovitz were declared ''Best Polish Act'' at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] in 2002 and again in 2003.\n*On January 23, 2005, as part of the [[European Commission]]'s ''Border Breakers'' award ceremony held at [[MIDEM]] 2005 in [[Cannes]], Myslovitz received the ''European Breakthrough'' award for ''Korova Milky Bar'' as the best-selling album out of the ten new [[European Union|EU]] member states.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
