Born in [[Massachusetts]], she gained an appreciation of the classical arts from her mother Mi Suk Rogers and of music from her father Charles Rogers, and she also studied dance from an early age and performed in talent contests. After her high school graduation, her family settled down in Virginia while she began to attend [[Georgetown University]], from which she later graduated with a degree in English and Fine Arts. While living in [[Washington, D.C.]], she met producer [[Rich Harrison]], who worked with such performers as [[Mary J. Blige]], and began developing demos with her. This led to a deal with Rise Entertainment and, in turn, major-label [[Columbia Records]].\n\n== Early life ==\nRogers was born in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]], to a Korean mother named Mi Suk and an [[African American]] father, Charles Rogers. A few months after she was born, the Rogers family moved to [[South Korea]], where Amerie lived for three years. Her father was a chief warrant officer in the U.S. military,<ref name=\"blender\">{{Cite web|url=https://blender.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422190659/http://www.blender.com/guide/67984/miss-thing.html|url-status=dead|title=Blender \u2013 All Things Blender, All In One Place|archivedate=April 22, 2009|website=Blender}}</ref> so the family lived in many different places, including Alaska, Texas, Virginia and Germany.

Growing up, she and her sister were forbidden to leave the house or use the phone on school days. The singer enrolled at [[Georgetown University]] to study literature, and was in [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps|Navy ROTC]]: \"My dad didn't force me into it or anything. I joined so I could afford an education.\" She quit ROTC after her sophomore year and graduated with a B.A. in English and a Fine Arts minor in design.\n\nWhile studying at Georgetown, Amerie befriended a Washington, D.C. club promoter who eventually put her in touch with producer [[Rich Harrison]]. During an interview with Maxim Magazine, Amerie said she agreed to meet up with Rich at a public location because she did not know Rich. McDonald's parking lot was chosen, where Rich played his tracks and Amerie sang along. Instantly they knew it was something special.\n\nHarrison, who had just worked on Mary J. Blige's albums ''[[Mary (Mary J. Blige album)|Mary]]'' and ''[[No More Drama]]'', began recording and developing demos with Amerie. This led to her first record deal with Columbia Records. According to Amerie, she and Harrison immediately hit it off. In a 2002 Interview with Hip Online, she said: \"For some reason we had a very special chemistry. When we would work together something great would happen.\"<ref>{{cite web|date=November 18, 2002|title=Amerie Hip Online Interview|url=http://www.hiponline.com/109/amerie-interview.html|publisher=Hip Online}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 2001\u20132003: ''All I Have'' ===\n{{Main|All I Have (album)}}\nAmerie recorded the chorus for the 2001 single \"[[Rule (Nas song)|Rule]]\", performed by [[Nas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvremix.com/urban/interviews/amerie2.shtml|title=Amerie Interview with MVRemix Urban &#124; US and Canadian Underground Hip Hop and Soul \u2013 exclusive interviews, reviews, articles|publisher=Mvremix.com|access-date=March 3, 2012}}</ref> The single peaked at number 67 on the  Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart in the United States.
