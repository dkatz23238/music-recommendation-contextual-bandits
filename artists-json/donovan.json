The first song revealed the influence of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], who had also influenced [[Bob Dylan]]. Dylan comparisons followed for some time.<ref name=pc48>{{Gilliland|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19823/m1 |title=Show 48 \u2013 The British are Coming!

She influenced Donovan's music but refused to marry him and she moved to the United States for several years in the late 1960s. They met by chance in 1970 and married soon after. Donovan had other relationships \u2013 one of which resulted in the birth of his first two children, [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]] and [[Ione Skye]], both of whom became actors.\n\n====Donovan and Dylan====\nDuring Bob Dylan's trip to the UK in the spring of 1965, the British music press were making comparisons of the two singer-songwriters which they presented as a rivalry. This prompted [[The Rolling Stones]] guitarist Brian Jones to say,\n\n{{blockquote|We've been watching Donovan too. He isn't too bad a singer but his stuff sounds like Dylan's. His 'Catch The Wind' sounds like 'Chimes of Freedom'. He's got a song, 'Hey Tangerine Eyes' and it sounds like Dylan's 'Mr. Tambourine Man'.<ref>Rolling Stones off The Record\", Mark Paytress, p.&nbsp;90</ref>}}\n\nDonovan is the undercurrent In [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s film ''[[Dont Look Back]]'' documenting Dylan's tour. Near the start of the film, Dylan opens a newspaper and exclaims, \"Donovan? Who is this Donovan?\" and [[Alan Price]] from [[The Animals]] spurred the rivalry on by telling Dylan that Donovan is a better guitar player, but that he had only been around for three months. Throughout the film Donovan's name is seen next to Dylan's on newspaper headlines and on posters in the background, and Dylan and his friends refer to him consistently.\n\nDonovan finally appears in the second half of the film, along with [[Derroll Adams]], in Dylan's suite at the [[Savoy Hotel]] despite Donovan's management refusing to allow journalists to be present, saying they did not want \"any stunt on the lines of the disciple meeting the messiah\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabotage.demon.co.uk/donovan/art/1.htm#mm5/5/65 |title=Melody Maker |date=5 May 1965 |publisher=Sabotage.demon.co.uk |access-date=18 May 2011}}</ref> According to Pennebaker, Dylan told him not to film the encounter, and Donovan played a song that sounded just like \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\" but with different words. When confronted with lifting his tune, Donovan said that he thought it was an old folk song.<ref name=\"Marcus, 2011\">{{citation|last1=Marcus |first1=Greil |title=Greil Marcus interviews D.A. Pennebaker about filming Bob Dylan|date=2011|publisher=New Video's Docurama Films}}</ref> Once the camera rolled, Donovan plays his song, \"To Sing For You\", and then asks Dylan to play \"[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue|Baby Blue]]\". Dylan later told ''[[Melody Maker]]'': \"He played some songs to me.&nbsp;... I like him.&nbsp;... He's a nice guy.\" ''Melody Maker'' noted that Dylan had mentioned Donovan in his song \"[[Talkin' World War III Blues|Talking World War Three Blues]]\" and that the crowd had jeered, to which Dylan had responded backstage: \"I didn't mean to put the guy down in my songs. I just did it for a joke, that's all.\"\n\nIn an interview for the BBC in 2001 to mark Dylan's 60th birthday, Donovan acknowledged Dylan as an influence early in his career while distancing himself from \"Dylan clone\" allegations:\n\n{{blockquote|The one who really taught us to play and learn all the traditional songs was [[Martin Carthy]] \u2013 who incidentally was contacted by Dylan when Bob first came to the UK. Bob was influenced, as all American folk artists are, by the [[Celtic music]] of Ireland, Scotland and England. But in 1962 we folk Brits were also being influenced by some folk Blues and the American folk-exponents of our Celtic Heritage&nbsp;... Dylan appeared after [[Woody Guthrie|Woody]] [Guthrie], [[Pete Seeger|Pete]] [Seeger] and [[Joan Baez|Joanie]] [Baez] had conquered our hearts, and he sounded like a cowboy at first but I knew where he got his stuff \u2013 it was Woody at first, then it was [[Jack Kerouac]] and the stream-of-consciousness poetry which moved him along. But when I heard '[[Blowin' in the Wind]]' it was the clarion call to the new generation \u2013 and we artists were encouraged to be as brave in writing our thoughts in music&nbsp;... We were not captured by his influence, we were encouraged to mimic him \u2013 and remember every British band from the [[Rolling Stones|Stones]] to the [[Beatles]] were copying note for note, lick for lick, all the American pop and blues artists \u2013 this is the way young artists learn. There's no shame in mimicking a hero or two \u2013 it flexes the creative muscles and tones the quality of our composition and technique. It was not only Dylan who influenced us \u2013 for me he was a spearhead into protest, and we all had a go at his style. I sounded like him for five minutes \u2013 others made a career of his sound. Like troubadours, Bob and I can write about any facet of the human condition. To be compared was natural, but I am not a copyist.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1347199.stm |title=Donovan remembers Dylan |last=Anon |date=23 May 2001 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=7 November 2009}}</ref>}}\n\n====Collaboration with Mickie Most====\n\nIn late 1965, Donovan split with his original management and signed with [[Ashley Kozak]], who was working for [[Brian Epstein]]'s [[NEMS Enterprises]].

Carr's conga style and McNair's flute playing are a feature of many recordings. Cameron, McNair and Carr also accompanied Donovan on several concert tours and can be heard on his 1968 live album ''[[Donovan in Concert (1968 album)|Donovan in Concert]]''.\n\n====''Sunshine Superman''====\nBy 1966, Donovan had shed the Dylan/Guthrie influences and become one of the first British pop musicians to adopt [[flower power]]. He immersed himself in jazz, [[blues]], [[Eastern world|Eastern]] music, and the new generation of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]-era [[West Coast of the United States|US West Coast]] bands such as [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[the Grateful Dead]]. He was entering his most creative phase as a songwriter and recording artist, working with Mickie Most and with arranger, musician, and jazz fan [[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron]]. Their first collaboration was ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'', one of the first [[psychedelic pop]] records.<ref name=\"classicbands\"/>\n\nDonovan's rise stalled in December 1965 when ''Billboard'' broke news of the impending production deal between Klein, Most, and Donovan, and then reported that Donovan was to sign with [[Epic Records]] in the US. Despite Kozak's denials, [[Pye Records]] dropped the single and a contract dispute ensued, because Pye had a US licensing arrangement with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. As a result, the UK release of the ''Sunshine Superman'' LP was delayed for months, robbing it of the impact it would have had. Another outcome was that the UK and US versions of this and later albums differed \u2013 three of his Epic LPs were not released in the UK, and ''Sunshine Superman'' was issued in a different form in each country. Several tracks on his late 1960s Epic (US) LPs were not released in the UK for many years. The legal dispute continued into early 1966. During the hiatus, Donovan holidayed in [[Greece]], where he wrote \"Writer in the Sun\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hit-channel.com/interview-donovan/68376 |title=Interview: Donovan |publisher=Hit-channel.com |date=20 June 2014 |access-date=19 August 2015}}</ref> inspired by rumours that his recording career was over. He toured the US and appeared on episode 23 of [[Pete Seeger]]'s television show ''[[Rainbow Quest]]'' in 1966 with [[Shawn Phillips]] and [[Rev. Gary Davis]]. After his return to London, he developed his friendship with [[Paul McCartney]] and contributed the line \"sky of blue and sea of green\" to \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/thebeatlessongs/a/yellowsubmarine.htm|title=Robert Fontenot: \"Yellow Submarine: The history of this classic Beatles song\", About.com; retrieved 2 December 2008|publisher=Oldies.about.com|access-date=18 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy spring 1966, the American contract problems had been resolved, and Donovan signed a $100,000 deal with Epic Records. Donovan and Most went to [[CBS Studio Building|CBS Studios]] in Los Angeles, where they recorded tracks for an LP, much composed during the preceding year. Although folk elements were prominent, the album showed increasing influence of jazz, American west coast psychedelia and [[folk rock]] \u2013 especially [[the Byrds]]. The LP sessions were completed in May, and \"[[Sunshine Superman (song)|Sunshine Superman]]\" was released in the US as a single in June. It was a success, selling 800,000 in six weeks and reaching No. 1. It went on to sell over one million, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/204 204] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/204 }}</ref> The LP followed in August, preceded by orders of 250,000 copies, reached No. 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|album chart]] and sold over half a million.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/>\n\nThe US version of the ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' album is in [[chamber music|chamber]]-style folk-jazz arrangements, and features instruments including acoustic bass, [[sitar]], saxophone, tablas and congas, harpsichord, strings and oboe. Highlights include the swinging \"[[The Fat Angel]]\", which Donovan's book confirms was written for [[Cass Elliot]] of [[the Mamas & the Papas]]. The song is notable for naming the Jefferson Airplane before they became known internationally and before [[Grace Slick]] joined. Other tracks include \"Bert's Blues\" (a tribute to [[Bert Jansch]]), \"Guinevere\", and \"Legend of a Girl Child Linda\", a track featuring voice, acoustic guitar and a small orchestra for over six minutes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Hurdy Gurdy Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVsIp2DSuQMC&pg=PA164 |access-date=19 February 2013|isbn = 9780099487036|author1 = Donovan|last2 = Leitch|first2 = Donovan|year = 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe album also features the [[sitar]], which was played by American folk-rock singer [[Shawn Phillips]]. Donovan met Phillips in London in 1965, and he became a friend and early collaborator, playing acoustic guitar and sitar on recordings including ''Sunshine Superman'' as well as accompanying Donovan at concerts and on Pete Seeger's TV show. Creatively, Phillips served as a silent partner in the gestation of many of Donovan's songs from the era, with the singer later acknowledging that Phillips primarily composed \"[[Season of the Witch (song)|Season of the Witch]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldminemag.com/article/follow-the-ever-changing-ballad-of-singer-songwriter-shawn-phillips |title=Follow the ever-changing ballad of Shawn Phillips |date=25 July 2012}}</ref> Several songs including the title track had a harder edge. The driving, jazzy \"The Trip\", named after a Los Angeles club name, chronicled an [[LSD]] [[Psychedelic experience|trip]] during his time in L.A. and is loaded with references to his sojourn on the West Coast, and names Dylan and Baez. The third \"heavy\" song was \"Season of the Witch\".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Recorded with American and British session players, it features Donovan's first recorded performance on electric guitar. The song was covered by [[Julie Driscoll]], [[Brian Auger]] and the Trinity on their first LP in 1967, and [[Al Kooper]] and [[Stephen Stills]] recorded an 11-minute version on the 1968 album, ''[[Super Session]]''. Donovan's version is also in the closing sequence of the [[Gus Van Sant]] film, ''[[To Die For]]''. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nBecause of earlier contractual problems, the UK version of ''Sunshine Superman'' LP was not released for another nine months. This was a compilation of tracks from the US albums ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' and ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]''. Donovan did not choose the tracks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n====Mellow Yellow====\n[[File:Royal Albert Hall, London - Nov 2012.jpg|thumb|Royal Albert Hall]]\nOn 24 October 1966, Epic released the single \"[[Mellow Yellow]]\", arranged by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and purportedly featuring [[Paul McCartney]] on backing vocals, but not in the chorus.<ref name=\"classicbands\"/> In his autobiography Donovan explained \"electrical banana\" was a reference to a \"yellow-coloured vibrator\".<ref>Donovan, ''Donovan in Concert'', released on Atlantic July 1968, re-issued on BGO February 2002.

In January he gave a concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] accompanied by a ballerina who danced during a 12-minute performance of \"Golden Apples\". On 14 January, [[NME|New Musical Express]] reported he was to write incidental music for a [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] production of ''[[As You Like It]]'', but this did not come to fruition. His version of \"[[Under the Greenwood Tree]]\" did appear on \"[[A Gift from a Flower to a Garden]]\".\n\nIn March Epic released the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' LP (not released in the UK), which reached No. 14 in the US album charts, plus a non-album single, \"[[Epistle to Dippy]]\", a Top 20 hit in the US. Written as an open letter to a school friend, the song had a pacifist message as well as psychedelic imagery. The real \"Dippy\" was in the [[British Army]] in Malaysia. According to Brian Hogg, who wrote the liner notes for the Donovan boxed set ''[[Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964\u20131976|Troubadour]]'', Dippy heard the song, contacted Donovan and left the army. On 9 February 1967, Donovan was among guests invited by the Beatles to Abbey Road Studios for the orchestral overdub for \"[[A Day in the Life]]\", the finale to ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Day in the Life:One Family, the Beautiful People, and the End of the Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OfMWwVXsl0EC&pg=PT78 |access-date=20 February 2013|isbn = 9780786748006|last1 = Greenfield|first1 = Robert|date = 17 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Arrest====\nIn mid-1966, Donovan became the first high-profile British pop star to be arrested for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref name=\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\"/> Donovan's drug use was mostly restricted to cannabis, with occasional use of [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} His LSD use is thought to be referenced indirectly in some of his lyrics.<ref name=\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\"/> Public attention was drawn to his marijuana use by the TV documentary ''A Boy Called Donovan'' in early 1966, which showed the singer and friends smoking cannabis at a party thrown by the film crew. Donovan's arrest proved to be the first in a long series involving the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In early 1967, Donovan was subject of an expos\u00e9 in the ''[[News of the World]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pop Music and the Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-ViwZnnR3oC&q=donovan+1967+news+of+the+world&pg=PA117 |access-date=19 February 2013|isbn = 9781566399661|last1 = Jones|first1 = Steve|year = 2002}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Donovan, the article was based on an interview by an ex-girlfriend of his friend Gypsy Dave. The article was the first in a three-part series, ''Drugs & Pop Stars \u2013 Facts That Will Shock You.'' It was quickly shown some claims were false. A ''News of the World'' reporter claimed to have spent an evening with [[Mick Jagger]], who allegedly discussed his drug use and offered drugs to companions. He had mistaken Brian Jones for Jagger, and Jagger sued the newspaper for libel. Among other supposed revelations were claims that Donovan and stars including members of [[The Who]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[The Moody Blues]] regularly smoked marijuana, used other drugs, and held parties where the recently banned hallucinogen LSD was used, specifically naming the Who's [[Pete Townshend]] and Cream's [[Ginger Baker]].\n\nIt emerged later that the ''News of the World'' reporters were passing information to the police. In the late 1990s, ''The Guardian'' said ''News of the World'' reporters had alerted police to the party at [[Keith Richards]]'s home, which was raided on 12 February 1967. Although Donovan's was not as sensational as the later arrests of Jagger and Richards, he was refused entry to the US until late 1967. He could not appear at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey International Pop Festival]] in June that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Season of \"Season of the Witch\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/05/season-of-the-witch.html|publisher=www.newyorker.com|access-date=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1967\u201369: International success===\nIn July 1967, Epic released \"[[There Is a Mountain]]\", which just missed the US top ten and was later used as the basis for [[the Allman Brothers Band]]'s \"[[Mountain Jam]]\". In September, Donovan toured the US, backed by a jazz group and accompanied by his father, who introduced the show. Later that month, Epic released Donovan's fifth album, a set entitled, ''[[A Gift from a Flower to a Garden]]'', the first rock music box set and only the third pop-rock double album released. It was split into halves. The first, \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\", was for people of his generation who would one day be parents; the second, \"[[For Little Ones]]\", was songs Donovan had written for coming generations. Worried it might be a poor seller, Epic boss [[Clive Davis]] also insisted the albums be split and sold separately in the US (the \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\" album cover was photographed at [[Bodiam Castle]]), but his fears were unfounded \u2013 although it took time, the original boxed set sold steadily, eventually peaking at 19 in the US album chart and achieving gold record status in the US in early 1970.\n\nThe psychedelic and mystical overtones were unmistakable \u2013 the front cover featured an [[infrared photography|infra-red]] photograph by [[Karl Ferris]] showing Donovan at [[Bodiam Castle]], dressed in a robe, holding flowers and peacock feathers, while the back photo showed him holding hands with Indian guru [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. The liner notes included an appeal for young people to give up drugs. His disavowal of drugs came after his time with the Maharishi in [[Rishikesh]], a topic discussed in a two-part interview for the first two issues of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Rolling Stone|title=Donovan: The Rolling Stone Interview |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/donovan-the-rolling-stone-interview-part-2-232058/ |first=John|last=Carpenter|volume=1|issue=1,2|date=9\u201323 November 1967}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1967 Donovan contributed two songs to the [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[Poor Cow]]''. \"Be Not Too Hard\" was a musical setting of [[Christopher Logue]]'s poem ''September Song'', and was later recorded by such artists as [[Joan Baez]] and [[Shusha Guppy]]. The title track, originally entitled \"Poor Love\", was the B-side of his next single, \"[[Jennifer Juniper]]\", which was inspired by [[Jenny Boyd]], sister of [[George Harrison]]'s wife, [[Pattie Boyd]] and was another top 40 hit in the US. Donovan developed interest in eastern mysticism and claims to have interested the Beatles in [[transcendental meditation]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn early 1968 he was part of the group that traveled to the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in [[Rishikesh]]. The visit gained worldwide attention thanks to the presence of all four Beatles as well as [[Beach Boys]] lead singer [[Mike Love]], as well as actress [[Mia Farrow]] and her sister Prudence (who inspired Lennon to write \"[[Dear Prudence]]\").

The liner notes from EMI's reissues say the song was intended for Mac MacLeod, who had a heavy rock band called [[Hurdy Gurdy (band)|Hurdy Gurdy]]. After hearing MacLeod's version, Donovan considered giving it to [[Jimi Hendrix]], but when Most heard it, he convinced Donovan to record it himself. Donovan tried to get Hendrix to play, but he was on tour.

The song became one of Donovan's biggest hits, making the Top 5 in the UK and the US, and the Top 10 in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn July 1968, Epic released ''[[Donovan in Concert (1968 album)|Donovan in Concert]]'', the recording of his Anaheim concert in September 1967. The cover featured only a painting by [[Fleur Cowles]] (with neither the artist's name nor the title). The album contained two of his big hits and songs which would have been new to the audience. The expanded double CD from 2006 contained \"Epistle To Derroll\", a tribute to one of his formative influences, [[Derroll Adams]]. The album also includes extended group arrangements of \"Young Girl Blues\" and \"The Pebble and the Man\", a song later reworked and retitled as \"Happiness Runs\". In the summer of 1968, Donovan worked on a second LP of children's songs, released in 1971 as the double album, ''[[HMS Donovan (album)|HMS Donovan]]''. In September, Epic released a single, \"[[Lal\u00e9na]]\", a subdued acoustic ballad which reached the low 30s in the US. The album ''[[The Hurdy Gurdy Man]]'' followed (not released in the UK), continuing the style of the ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'' LP and reached 20 in the US, despite containing two earlier hits, the title track and \"Jennifer Juniper\".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAfter another US tour in the autumn he collaborated with Paul McCartney, who was producing ''[[Postcard (album)|Postcard]]'', the debut LP by Welsh singer [[Mary Hopkin]]. Hopkin covered three Donovan songs: \"Lord Of The Reedy River\", \"Happiness Runs\" and \"Voyage of the Moon\". McCartney returned the favour by playing tambourine and singing backing vocals on Donovan's next single, \"[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]\", which was released in the UK (with \"I Love My Shirt\" as the B-side) in late November and reached 23.<ref name=ukcharts>{{cite web|title=Donovan|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/donovan/|publisher=officialcharts.com|access-date=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1969, the comedy film ''[[If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium]]'' featured music by Donovan; the title tune was written by him and sung by J. P. Rags, and he also performed \"Lord of the Reedy River\" in the film as a singer at a youth hostel. On 20 January, Epic released the single, \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\", with \"[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]\" as the B-side. The A-side, a gentle [[Calypso music|calypso]]-styled song, contained another anti-war message, and became a moderate Top 40 US hit. However, when DJs in America and Australia flipped it and began playing \"Atlantis\", that became a hit. The gentle \"Atlantis\" later formed the backdrop to a violent scene in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1990 film ''[[GoodFellas]]''. \"Atlantis\" was revived in 2000 for an episode of ''[[Futurama]]'' titled \"The Deep South\" (2ACV12) which aired on 16 April that year. For this episode Donovan recorded a satirical version of the song describing the Lost City of [[Atlanta]] which featured in the episode.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn March 1969 (too soon to include \"Atlantis\"), Epic and Pye released ''Donovan's Greatest Hits'', which included four previous singles \u2013 \"Epistle To Dippy\", \"There is a Mountain\", \"Jennifer Juniper\" and \"Lal\u00e9na\", as well as rerecorded versions of \"[[Colours (Donovan song)|Colours]]\" and \"Catch The Wind\" (which had been unavailable to Epic because of Donovan's contractual problems) and stereo versions of \"Sunshine Superman\" (previously unissued full length version) and \"Season of the Witch\". It became the most successful album of his career; it reached 4 in the US, became a million-selling gold record, and stayed on the Billboard album chart for more than a year. On 26 June 1969 the track \"[[Barabajagal (single)|Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)]]\" (recorded May 1969), which gained him a following on the rave scene decades later, was released, reaching 12 in the UK but charting less strongly in the US. This time he was backed by the original [[Jeff Beck]] Group, featuring Beck on lead guitar, [[Ronnie Wood]] on bass, [[Nicky Hopkins]] on piano, and [[Micky Waller]] on drums. The Beck group was under contract to Most and it was Most's idea to team them with Donovan to bring a heavier sound to Donovan's work, while introducing a lyrical edge to Beck's.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOn 7 July 1969, Donovan performed at the first show in the second season of free rock concerts in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, which also featured [[Blind Faith]], [[Richie Havens]], [[the Edgar Broughton Band]] and the [[Third Ear Band]]. In September 1969, the \"Barabajagal\" album reached 23 in the US.

After the rift, Donovan spent two months writing and recording the album ''[[Open Road (Donovan album)|Open Road]]'' as a member of the rock trio Open Road. Stripping the sound of Most's heavy studio productions down to stuff that could be played by a live band, Donovan dubbed the sound \"[[Celtic Rock]]\". The album peaked at No. 16 in the U.S., the third-highest of any of his full-length releases to date, but as his concert appearances became less frequent and new artists and styles of popular music began to emerge, his commercial success began to decline. Donovan said:\n\n<blockquote>I was exhausted and looking for roots and new directions. I checked into Morgan Studios in London and stayed a long while creating Open Road and the ''HMS Donovan'' sessions. Downstairs was McCartney, doing his solo album. I had left Mickie after great years together. The new decade dawned and I had accomplished everything any young singer-songwriter could achieve. What else was there to do but to experiment beyond the fame and into the new life, regardless of the result?<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\"/></blockquote>\n\nDonovan's plan for ''Open Road'' was to tour the world for a year, beginning with a boat voyage around the [[Aegean Sea]], documented in the 1970 film ''[[There is an Ocean]]''. This was partially on the advice from his management to go into [[tax exile]], during which he was not to set foot in the UK until April 1971, but after touring to France, Italy, Russia, and Japan, he cut the tour short:\n\n<blockquote>I travelled to Japan and was set to stay out of the UK for a year and earn the largest fees yet for a solo performer, and all tax-free. At the time the UK tax for us was 98%. During that Japanese tour I had a gentle breakdown, which made me decide to break the tax exile. Millions were at stake. My father, my agent, they pleaded for me not to step onto the [[BOAC]] jet bound for London. I did and went back to my little cottage in the woods. Two days later a young woman came seeking a cottage to rent. It was Linda.<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Reunions with Linda Lawrence and Mickie Most===\nAfter this reunion, Donovan and Linda married on 2 October 1970 at Windsor register office and honeymooned in the Caribbean. Donovan dropped out of the round of tour promotion and concentrated on writing, recording and his family. The largely self-produced children's album ''HMS Donovan'' in 1971, went unreleased in the US and did not gain a wide audience. During an 18-month tax exile in Ireland (1971\u201372), he wrote for the 1972 film ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' in the title role, and for ''[[Brother Sun, Sister Moon]]'' (1972). The title song from the Zeffirelli film provided Donovan with a publishing windfall in 1974 when it was covered as the B-side of the million-selling US top 5 hit \"[[The Lord's Prayer (Sister Janet Mead song)|The Lord's Prayer]]\", by Australia's singing nun, [[Sister Janet Mead]].\n\nAfter a new deal with Epic, Donovan reunited with Mickie Most in early 1973, resulting in the LP ''Cosmic Wheels'', which featured arrangements by [[Chris Spedding]].<ref name=\"Lorne Murdoch 2005\"/> It was his last chart success, reaching the top 40 in America and Britain. Late in the year he released ''Essence To Essence'', produced by [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], and a live album recorded in Japan and released only in Japan, which featured an extended version of \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" which included an additional verse written by [[George Harrison]] in [[Rishikesh]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Beatles As Musicians:Revolver through the Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CAvwZPKTkoC&pg=PA158 |access-date=19 February 2013|isbn = 9780199880935|last1 = Everett|first1 = Walter|date = 31 March 1999}}</ref> While recording the album, [[Alice Cooper]] invited Donovan to share lead vocals on his song \"[[Billion Dollar Babies (Alice Cooper song)|Billion Dollar Babies]]\".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n''Cosmic Wheels'' was followed up by two albums that same year: his second concert album, ''[[Live in Japan: Spring Tour 1973]]'', and the more introspective ''[[Essence to Essence]]''. His last two albums for Epic Records were ''[[7-Tease]]'' (1974) and ''[[Slow Down World]]'' (1976). In 1977, he opened for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] on their six-month tour of North America and Europe following the release of ''[[Going for the One]]'' (1977). The 1978 LP, ''[[Donovan (album)|Donovan]]'' was on Most's [[RAK Records]] in the UK and on Clive Davis' new [[Arista Records]] in the US; it reunited him for the last time with Most and Cameron, but was not well received at the height of the [[New wave music|new wave]] and did not chart.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===1980s: occasional appearances===\nThe punk era (1976\u20131980) provoked a backlash in Britain against the optimism and whimsy of the hippie era, of which Donovan was a prime example. The word \"hippie\" became pejorative, and Donovan's fortunes suffered.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} In this period he released the albums ''Neutronica'' (1980), ''Love Is Only Feeling'' (1981), and ''Lady of the Stars'' (1984), and guest-starred on ''[[Stars on Ice]]'', a half-hour variety show on ice produced by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Toronto. There was a respite when he appeared alongside [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Eric Clapton]] and Jeff Beck in the [[Amnesty International]] benefit show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]''.  Accompanied by [[Danny Thompson]], Donovan performed several hits including \"Sunshine Superman\", \"Mellow Yellow\", \"Colours\", \"Universal Soldier\" and \"Catch the Wind\". He was also in the performance of Dylan's \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\" for the show's finale. Donovan also appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] on 18 June 1989 with the band [[Ozric Tentacles]] accompanying him onstage.\n\n===1990s: a retrospective decade===\nIn 1990 Donovan released a live album featuring new performances of his classic songs. In 1991, [[Nettwerk]] released a [[tribute album]] to Donovan, ''[[Island of Circles]]''. Sony's 2-CD boxed set ''[[Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964\u20131976]]'' (1992) continued the restoration of his reputation, and was followed by the 1994 release of ''Four Donovan Originals'', which saw his four classic Epic LPs on CD in their original form for the first time in the UK. He found an ally in rap producer and [[Def Jam]] label owner [[Rick Rubin]] and recorded the album ''[[Sutras (album)|Sutras]]'' for Rubin's [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]] label.<ref name=\"classicbands\"/>\n\n===2000s===\n{{BLP sources section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File: Donovan -10Aug2007.jpg|thumb|Donovan before a show in [[Washington, D.C.]], on 10 August 2007]]\nIn 2000, Donovan narrated and played himself in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode [[The Deep South (Futurama)|\"The Deep South\"]] on 16 April with a parody of the song \"Atlantis\".\n\nA new album, ''[[Beat Cafe]]'', on Appleseed Records in 2004, marked a return to the jazzy sound of his 1960s recordings and featured bassist [[Danny Thompson]] and drummer [[Jim Keltner]], with production by John Chelew ([[Blind Boys of Alabama]]). At a series of ''Beat Cafe'' performances in New York, [[Richard Barone]] ([[The Bongos]]) joined Donovan to sing and read passages from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Howl (poem)|Howl]]''.\n\nIn May 2004, Donovan played \"Sunshine Superman\" at the wedding concert for the [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Crown Prince]] and [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Crown Princess of Denmark]]. He released his early demo tapes, ''Sixty Four'', and a re-recording of the ''Brother Sun, Sister Moon'' soundtrack on [[iTunes]]. A set of his Mickie Most albums was released on 9 May 2005. This EMI set has extra tracks including another song recorded with the Jeff Beck Group. In 2005, his autobiography ''The Hurdy Gurdy Man'' was published. In May/June 2005, Donovan toured the UK (Beat Cafe Tour) and Europe with Tom Mansi on double bass, former [[The Damned (band)|Damned]] drummer [[Rat Scabies]] and [[Flipron]] keyboard player, Joe Atkinson.\n\nIn spring/summer 2006, Donovan played British festivals and two dates at Camden's [[The Jazz Caf\u00e9]], London.\n\nIn January 2007, Donovan played at the [[Kennedy Center]], in Washington, DC, at [[Alice Tully Hall]], in New York City, and at the [[Kodak Theatre]], in Los Angeles, in conjunction with a presentation by filmmaker [[David Lynch]] supporting the [[David Lynch Foundation]] for [[Transcendental Meditation in education|Consciousness-Based Education]] and world peace. The concert at the [[Kodak Theatre]] was filmed by [[Raven Productions]] and broadcast on [[public television]] as a [[pledge drive]].
