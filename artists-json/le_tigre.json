Benning left in 2000 and was replaced by [[JD Samson]] for the rest of the group's existence. They mixed punk's directness and politics with playful samples, eclectic pop, and [[lo-fi (audio)|lo-fi]] electronics. The group also added multimedia and performance art elements to their live shows, which often featured support from like-minded acts such as [[The Need]].<ref>5 \u201cMusic for Everyone.\u201d Contact - Spotify, www.spotify.com/.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== 1998\u20132000: Formation and ''Le Tigre'' ===\nFollowing the breakup of Bikini Kill in 1998, Kathleen Hanna released a solo album under the pseudonym ''[[Julie Ruin]]'' and moved to New York, where she wanted to perform ''Julie Ruin'' songs live. Not wanting to perform the material alone, she recruited Johanna Fateman, whom Hanna had known since meeting at a Bikini Kill concert several years prior. Sadie Benning, who had helped Hanna make a music video for the ''Julie Ruin'' song \"Aerobicide\", also joined in order to help with visuals and translating the music into performable material. These performances never happened.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-25|title='Le Tigre' Turns 20|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2062654/le-tigre-turns-20/reviews/the-anniversary/|access-date=2022-02-12|website=Stereogum|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHowever, while Benning was still in Chicago, Hanna and Fateman began sharing cassettes between the three band members, with songs that would eventually become material for Le Tigre. They took their name from one of many hypothetical bands made up by Hanna circa 1994.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=Just the Facts, Ma'am |url=http://www.letigreworld.com/sweepstakes/html_site/keep/keep.html |access-date=2022-02-12 |website=www.letigreworld.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422215527/http://www.letigreworld.com/sweepstakes/html_site/keep/keep.html |archive-date=22 April 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe band signed with [[Mr. Lady Records]], who owners Hanna and Fateman met while they were in Portland, Oregon. Hanna called the signing \"a logical choice\" because of the label's greater political commitment over their music releases.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SPOTLIGHT|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-04/21/095r-042100-idx.html|access-date=2022-02-12|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band's first album, ''[[Le Tigre (album)|Le Tigre]]'', was in October 1999. The band's original live performances consisted of Hanna, Fateman and Sadie performing music, along with JD Samson, a roadie they had met in September 1999, who manually operated a slideshow as a visual component to their music, as the band could not afford a projector at the time.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:Le Tigre - Indianapolis B - Stierch.jpg|thumb|right|Le Tigre performing in Indianapolis, Indiana, in the early 2000s]]\n\n=== 2000\u20132004: ''From The Desk of Mr. Lady EP and Feminist Sweepstakes'' ===\nIn 2000, Benning left the band. As the band was already into a month-long tour, they asked Samson to fill in for them during live performances. The band had already been considering increasing the involvement of Samson as possibly a backup singer or dancer, so asked her to become an official member. Hanna remarked that \"JD added an undeniable flair and charisma to the live show and took to touring and recording like a fish to water.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn October 2001, the band released their second album, ''[[Feminist Sweepstakes]]''.\n\nIn 2003, Le Tigre collaborated with [[Chicks on Speed]] on their cover of Tom Tom Club's \"[[Wordy Rappinghood#Chicks on Speed version|Wordy Rappinghood]]\" from their album ''[[99 Cents (Chicks on Speed album)|99 Cents]]'' along with other artists such as [[Miss Kittin]], [[Kevin Blechdom]], [[Adult (band)|ADULT.]]'s [[Nicola Kuperus]], and [[Tina Weymouth]] of [[Tom Tom Club]].<ref name=\"allmusicreview99cents\">{{cite web| last = Phares| first = Heather|url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=99-cents-r668474|pure_url=yes}}| title = 99 Cents - Chicks on Speed | work = [[Allmusic]]| publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]]| year = 2003 | access-date = 2011-02-26}}</ref> The cover became a moderate dance hit in Europe, peaking at number five on the [[Ultratop|Belgian Dance Chart]],<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.ultratop.be/nl/song/5a824/Chicks-On-Speed-Wordy-Rappinghood |title=Ultratop.be - Chicks On Speed - Wordy Rappinghood|language=nl|work=[[Ultratop]]|publisher=[[Ultratop]] & Hung Medien / hitparade.ch|access-date=2011-02-26}}</ref> and at number sixty-six on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=The Official Charts Company - Chicks On Speed |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=2011-02-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 {{!}} Official Charts Company |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/20040307/7501/ |access-date=2022-04-24 |website=www.officialcharts.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== 2004\u20132007: major label deal, ''This Island'' and hiatus ===\nIn March 2004, Le Tigre signed with Strummer, a subsidiary of major label [[Universal Records (1995\u22122005)|Universal Records]],<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=2004-03-11|title=Le Tigre Inks With Strummer/Universal|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/le-tigre-inks-with-strummeruniversal-1442419/|access-date=2022-02-12|magazine=Billboard|language=en-US}}</ref> a move described by Kathleen Hanna as a make-or-break for the band, who were considering breaking up due to exhaustion.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Le Tigre|url=https://www.pollstar.com/article/le-tigre-49824|access-date=2022-02-12|website=Pollstar|date=24 January 2005 }}</ref>  In June 2004, Mr. Lady closed down,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-09-27 |title=DISCORDER Farewell, Mr. Lady |url=http://discorder.citr.ca/features/04julyfarewell.html |access-date=2022-02-12 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205836/http://discorder.citr.ca/features/04julyfarewell.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the band began reissuing their back catalogue under their own label, Le Tigre Records, with distribution from Touch & Go Records.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Le Tigre / Interviews / Silent Uproar|url=https://silentuproar.com/interviews/67/le-tigre/|access-date=2022-02-17|website=silentuproar.com}}</ref>\n\nThey released their debut major-label album, ''[[This Island (Le Tigre album)|This Island]]'', in October 2004.
