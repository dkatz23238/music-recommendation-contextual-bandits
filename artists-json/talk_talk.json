The group achieved early chart success with the [[synth-pop]] singles \"[[Talk Talk (Talk Talk song)|Talk Talk]]\" (1982), \"[[It's My Life (Talk Talk song)|It's My Life]]\", and \"[[Such a Shame]]\" (both 1984) before moving towards a more experimental approach informed by jazz and free improvisation in the mid-1980s,<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> pioneering what became known as [[post-rock]].<ref name=\"chutlerB\" /> Talk Talk achieved widespread critical success in Europe and the UK with the singles \"[[Life's What You Make It (Talk Talk song)|Life's What You Make It]]\" (1985) and \"[[Living in Another World]]\" (1986); in 1988, they released their fourth album ''[[Spirit of Eden]]'', which was critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful.\n\nFriction with the band's [[Record label|label]], [[EMI Records|EMI]], resulted in legal action and countersuing. Webb departed, and the band switched to [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] for their final studio album, 1991's ''[[Laughing Stock (album)|Laughing Stock]]'', but split soon afterwards. Singer [[Mark Hollis (musician)|Mark Hollis]] released one solo album in 1998 before retiring from the music industry; he died in 2019. The band's founding bass player and drummer, Paul Webb and Lee Harris, played in several bands together; long-term collaborator [[Tim Friese-Greene]] continued in the business as a musician and producer.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1981\u20131983: Formation ===\n\nTalk Talk began as a quartet consisting of [[Mark Hollis]], formerly from The Reaction (vocals/main songwriter), [[Lee Harris (drummer)|Lee Harris]] (drums), [[Paul Webb]] (bass guitar), and Simon Brenner (keyboards). In their early years they were often compared with [[Duran Duran]]. In addition to a band name consisting of a repeated word, the two shared a [[Roxy Music]]-inspired musical direction, as well as the same record label ([[EMI]]) and producer ([[Colin Thurston]]). The band also supported Duran Duran on tour in late 1981.\n\nThe band released their first single, \"Mirror Man\", on EMI in February 1982. The single was not a great success, but was quickly followed by their [[Talk Talk (Talk Talk song)|self-titled single]] in April 1982 (a rerecording of a track by The Reaction) which reached No. 52 in the UK. The band's first album, titled ''[[The Party's Over (Talk Talk album)|The Party's Over]]'', was released in July 1982. The band had their first UK [[Top 40]] hits with the singles \"[[Today (Talk Talk song)|Today]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;14) and a re-release of \"[[Talk Talk (Talk Talk song)|Talk Talk]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;23). These singles also were hits in other countries including Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The re-release of the \"Talk Talk\" single reached the U.S. Top 75. The album was produced by [[Colin Thurston]], who was [[Duran Duran]]'s in-house EMI producer at the time, but picked by Hollis because of his involvement with [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[Heroes (David Bowie album)|Heroes]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Seabrook|first=Thomas Jerome|title=Bowie in Berlin: A New Career in a New Town|date=February 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsSHjTf_-F8C&pg=PA250|publisher=Jawbone|isbn=978-1-906002-08-4|pages=250\u201351}}</ref> It was a moderate success in the UK reaching No. 21, and was later certified Silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] for sales of 60,000 copies by 1985.

At this point, Talk Talk was now a trio, as Brenner was never officially replaced. However, [[Tim Friese-Greene]] was recruited to assist with the recording of their second album, ''[[It's My Life (album)|It's My Life]]'',<ref name=\"tape\">{{cite book|last1=Crane|first1=Larry|last2=Eckman|first2=Chris|editor=Larry Crane|title=Tape Op: The Book about Creative Music Recording, Volume 2|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foViXo_JV9YC&pg=PA74|year=2010|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-9779903-0-6|pages=74\u201377|chapter=Sharing food and conversation with Phil Brown}}</ref> and he became the band's producer as well as keyboardist and Hollis' songwriting partner.

As such, he did not play with the touring band on live dates, and was absent from the band's publicity material.\n\n=== 1984\u20131986: Commercial success ===\n\nAlthough major success eluded them in the UK, Talk Talk achieved considerable international success in 1984/85, particularly in continental Europe, North America and New Zealand, with the album ''[[It's My Life (album)|It's My Life]]''. The accompanying single \"Such a Shame\" (inspired by the book ''[[The Dice Man]]'') became a Top 10 hit in Austria,<ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Talk+Talk&titel=Such+A+Shame&cat=s |title=Talk Talk \u2013 Such A Shame |publisher=austriancharts.at |access-date=4 February 2010}}</ref> Italy, France, Germany, [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://hitparade.ch/showitem.asp?interpret=Talk+Talk&titel=Such+A+Shame&cat=s |title=Talk Talk \u2013 Such A Shame |publisher=hitparade.ch |access-date=4 February 2010}}</ref> during this period.

Commercial success notwithstanding, the band made deliberate choices that moved them away from the mainstream. The music video for \"It's My Life\", for instance, featured a grumpy Hollis who mocks lip-synching; after EMI protested, they re-shot the video, turning it into \"a total piss-take of lip-synching\", in [[Alan McGee]]'s words.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{cite news |last=McGee |first=Alan |title=Wherefore art thou Mark Hollis |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 April 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/apr/09/markhollis}}</ref>\n\nThe artist [[James Marsh (artist)|James Marsh]] designed the first cover image for ''It's My Life'' based on the band's name. He followed the theme for subsequent singles, remaining the band's artistic frontman and creating all their covers and posters throughout their career.\n\nTalk Talk abandoned the synthpop style completely with their third album, 1986's ''[[The Colour of Spring]]''. It became their biggest success in the UK, making the Top 10 (and certified Gold by the BPI for sales over 100,000 copies), in part due to the Top 20 single \"[[Life's What You Make It (Talk Talk song)|Life's What You Make It]]\", which was also successful internationally.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://hitparade.ch/song/Talk-Talk/Life's-What-You-Make-It-1390 |title=Talk Talk \u2013 Life's What You Make It |website=Hitparade.ch |access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref> Another single, \"[[Living in Another World]]\", charted in the Top 40 in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and Italy (and just outside the Top 40 in the UK and France). By this time, all Talk Talk songs were being written by Hollis and Friese-Greene. The extended line-up for the 1986 tour consisted of Hollis, Webb and Harris, plus [[John Turnbull (musician)|John Turnbull]] (guitars), Rupert Black and Ian Curnow (keyboards), Phil Reis and Leroy Williams (percussion), and [[Mark Feltham (musician)|Mark Feltham]] (harmonica). Most notable among these concerts was their appearance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], 11 July 1986, released on DVD in 2008 as ''[[Live at Montreux 1986]]''.\n\n=== 1987\u20131991: Experimental period ===\n\nThe success of ''The Colour of Spring'' afforded the band a bigger budget and schedule for the recording of their next album. Over a year in the making, and featuring contributions from many outside musicians, ''[[Spirit of Eden]]'' was released in 1988, on EMI's [[Parlophone]] label. The album was assembled from many hours of improvised instrumentation that Hollis and Friese-Greene had edited and arranged using digital equipment. The result was a mix of rock, jazz, classical, and ambient music. Critically praised, the album reached the UK Top 20 and was certified Silver by the BPI for sales of over 60,000 copies. The band announced they would not be attempting to recreate the album live (since, according to Hollis, \"People would just want to hear the songs as they are on the album and for me that's not satisfying enough\"). Without touring or music videos or singles as the band intended, there was little marketing left that the record company could do; in the end the band grudgingly agreed to a video for the remixed version of \"[[I Believe in You (Talk Talk song)|I Believe in You]]\", released as first single. Hollis, though, was unhappy with the video, as he made clear in an interview with ''[[Q Magazine]]'': \"I really feel that [the video] was a massive mistake&nbsp;... I thought just by sitting there and listening and really thinking about what it was about, I could get that in my eyes. But you cannot do it. It just feels stupid. It was depressing and I wish I'd never done it.\"<ref name=\"deevoy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/28/from-rocks-backpages-talk-talk|title=Talk Talk: 'You should never listen to music as background music' \u2013 a classic interview from the vaults|last=Deevoy|first=Adrian|date=28 August 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring the making of ''Spirit of Eden'', Talk Talk manager Keith Aspden had attempted to free the band from their record contract with EMI. \"I knew by that time that EMI was not the company this band should be with,\" Aspden said. \"I was fearful that the money wouldn't be there to record another album.\"> EMI, however, wished to keep the band on their roster.  After many months of litigation, the band ultimately succeeded in extracting themselves from the contract. EMI then sued the band, claiming that ''Spirit of Eden'' was not \"commercially satisfactory\", but the case was thrown out of court.<ref name=\"McGee\"/> Webb left the band in late 1988.\n\nWith the band now released from EMI, the label released the retrospective compilation ''[[Natural History: The Very Best of Talk Talk|Natural History]]'' in 1990. It peaked at number 3 on the UK album chart and was certified Gold by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 copies. It was also an international success and eventually went on to sell more than 1&nbsp;million copies worldwide. The 1984 single \"It's My Life\" was also re-released, and this time became the band's highest charting single in their native country, reaching number 13 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. A re-release of the single \"Life's What You Make It\" also reached the Top 30. Following up on this renewed popular interest in the band, the label then released ''[[History Revisited]]'' in 1991, a compilation of new remixes, which made the UK Top 40 (it also reached the Top 30 in Germany and the Top 75 in the Netherlands). The band sued EMI for releasing the remixed material without their permission.<ref name=\"McGee\"/><ref>Buckley, Peter. \"The rough guide to rock\". Rough Guides, 2003. vii. {{ISBN|1-84353-105-4}}</ref>\n\nBy 1990 the band had essentially morphed into a vehicle for the studio recordings of Hollis and long-term collaborator Friese-Greene, along with session musicians (including long-term Talk Talk drummer Harris). The group signed a two-album contract with [[Polydor Records]] and released ''[[Laughing Stock (album)|Laughing Stock]]'' on Polydor's [[Verve Records]] imprint in 1991.  ''Laughing Stock'' crystallised the experimental sound the band started with ''Spirit of Eden'' (which has been retroactively categorised as \"[[post-rock]]\" by some critics).<ref name=chutlerB>{{cite book|last1=Chuter|first1=Jack|title=Storm Static Sleep|date=November 2015|publisher=Function|url=http://www.peoplesbookprize.com/Extracts/i1354.extract.pdf|ref=Chuter}}</ref> Even more minimalist than its predecessor, ''Laughing Stock'' reached just No.&nbsp;26 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n== Post break-up ==\n\nAfter ''Laughing Stock'', Talk Talk disbanded in 1991; [[Mark Hollis|Hollis]] said that he wished to focus on his family.<ref name=\"guardian1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/feb/28/talk-talk-mark-hollis|title=How Talk Talk spoke to today's artists|last=Myers|first=Ben|date=28 February 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=25 September 2013}}</ref> Paul Webb rejoined Lee Harris, and the two went on to form the band [[.O.rang]], while Tim Friese-Greene started recording under the name [[Tim Friese-Greene|Heligoland]].
