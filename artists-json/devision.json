Blender left the band in 1991 and Ganssert departed in 2000. The name De/Vision is a play on words{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. The majority of the band's lyrics are in [[English language|English]], but they have had some songs in [[German language|German]].\n\nIn 2000, Keth started a side project as the vocalist with Green Court, called 'Green Court featuring De/Vision'. The band with remaining members Keth and Adam were then signed to Drakkar Records and Sony BMG in Europe, and [[Dancing Ferret Discs]] in North America.  The band is currently signed to Metropolis Records in North America. Since 1994 the band has released a new studio album of original material roughly every 1.5 years, until their 2012 album ''Rockets and Swords''.\n\nIn 2009, the band started their own label, Popgefahr, primarily to release their own works as a response to the difficulty of garnering label support.<ref name=\"peek-a-boo-6\" />\n\nOn 25 May 2018, the single \"They Won't Silence Us\" was released, and on 22 June, the new studio album ''Citybeats'' was released by the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicline.de/product/De%EF%BF%BDVision/Citybeats+(Digipack+Edition)/CD///4046661570328|title=MusicLine|website=Musicline.de|accessdate=4 October 2020}}</ref> The LP was supported by a tour that started on 21 April 2018 and ended on 2 February 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-a-e-cdreviews-131/18304-cd-review-de-vision-city-beats|title=CD Review: De/Vision - City Beats|author=Susanne Schaller|website=Reflectionsofdarkness.com|accessdate=4 October 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n* Steffen Keth - vocals, composition \n* Thomas Adam - [[synthesizer]], songwriting, vocals\n\n===Former members===\n* Markus Ganssert - synthesizer, songwriting, composition (1988-2000)\n* Stefan Blender - synthesizer, composition (1988-1991)\n\n===Touring members===\n* Markus Koestner - [[Drum kit|drums]] (2005-2007, 2012\u2013present)\n* Lars Baumgart - [[Electric guitar|guitar]]s (1998-2007)\n* Achim F\u00e4rber - drums (2000-2004)\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|De/Vision discography}}\n;Studio albums\n*''World Without End'' (1994)\n*''Unversed In Love'' (1995)\n*''Fairyland?''
