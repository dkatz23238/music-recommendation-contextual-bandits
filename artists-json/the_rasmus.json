Jarno Lahti left the year after and was replaced by Janne Heiskanen in 1995. Heiskanen quit the band in 1998 and was soon replaced by Aki Hakala. Pauli Rantasalmi left the band and was replaced by female guitarist Emilia \"Emppu\" Suhonen in 2022. Best known for their 2003 hit single \"[[In the Shadows (song)|In the Shadows]]\", the band has sold 5 million albums worldwide and approximately 350,000 albums in [[Finland]] alone, and has won numerous awards, both domestic and international.

In December 1995 they released their debut [[Extended play|EP]] [[1st (The Rasmus EP)|''1st'']], including the songs \"Funky Jam\", \"Myself\", \"Frog\" and \"Rakkauslaulu\". In only a few weeks the EP had already sold 1000 copies. The EP was originally released independently through [[Teja G. Records]] but was re-released through [[Warner Music Finland]] after they signed with them early in 1996. The band also wrote the song \"Don't Shut the Door\" which would stay unused until it was re-written in 2009 as \"[[October & April]]\" for their compilation album ''[[Best of 2001\u20132009]]''.<ref name=\"therasmus.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.therasmus.com/home.html |title=The Rasmus |publisher=The Rasmus |access-date=23 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422232753/http://www.therasmus.com/home.html |archive-date=22 April 2012 }}</ref> In 1996 they released their debut album [[Peep (album)|''Peep'']] through Warner Music Finland. The album was first released in Finland on 23 September, where it went Gold, and later in Estonia and Russia, and subsequently worldwide. Later in 1996 the band released two more EP's, [[2nd (The Rasmus EP)|''2nd'']] and [[3rd (The Rasmus EP)|''3rd'']]. Even though labeled as an EP, ''3rd'' went No.&nbsp;8 on the Finnish Singles Chart later that year.\nNext year the band won an [[Emma-gaala|EMMA]] (the Finnish equivalent of Grammys) for the best newcomer of 1996. Lauri and Pauli decided to quit school to focus fully on Rasmus and on 29 August they released their second album [[Playboys (The Rasmus album)|''Playboys'']]. It went Gold in Finland, and the single \"Blue\" also went Gold when it was released in May the same year.<ref name=\"therasmus.com\"/>\n\n===Musical change and signing with Playground Music (1998\u20132000)===\n{{main|Hell of a Tester}}\n1998 marked the release of the third Rasmus album ''[[Hell of a Tester]]'' (sometimes written ''Hellofatester''). The album was released on 2 November and marks a change in their musical style from funk to more solid rock. The album received Gold status in Finland. The most popular single was \"[[Liquid (The Rasmus song)|Liquid]]\", which was released in September, getting into the Top 40 on MTV Nordic. It was voted Single of the Year for 1998 by music critics and fans and the video won an award in 1999 at the Finnish Music Video Awards. Lauri wrote Liquid on [[Lauttasaari]] bridge. The band also wrote religious material which never saw daylight.<ref name=\"therasmus.com\"/> During 1999 Rasmus were headlining big festivals in Finland. Janne Heiskanen left the band after playing his last gig supporting [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Janne decided to retire himself in meditation in India, where he lived for some years. This left the band in disarray and were close to breaking up. Aki Hakala, who had previously sold merchandise for the band, was eventually asked to become the new drummer. Together with [[Killer (Finnish band)|Killer]] and [[Kwan (band)|Kwan]] they formed the [[Dynasty (association)|Dynasty association]] a small, independent record label for recruiting new Finnish artists.<ref name=\"therasmus.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dynastyhelsinki.fi/fi/etusivu |title=Etusivu |publisher=Dynastyhelsinki.fi |access-date=23 April 2012}}</ref> In 2000 the band changed their name from \"Rasmus\" to \"The Rasmus\" to avoid confusion with the Swedish DJ of the same name (another artist, British Rasmus Gardell, has also used the name). In late 1999 The Cardigans' manager Petri H. Lund\u00e9n recommended the band to Lars Tengroth, director of new Swedish independent label Playground Music. Tengroth went to see them play live in Helsinki and, as he later told [[HitQuarters]], \"fell in love with them straight away\". Having released three albums in Finland and achieved modest success they were looking to develop their career outside of the country and Playground agreed to help them do this. In late 2000 the band began working with producers Martin Hansen & Micke Nord in Sweden for their next album, ending up leaving their former funk sound completely behind and changing the style into straight forward pop rock. Once signed to Playground the band spent time developing their act to meet the demands of establishing themselves internationally. According to Tengroth: \"It was like starting from scratch; we were creating a new band so to speak.\" They did a lot of things that were new to them \u2013 they spent a long time working on their songs before recording, they worked with producers for the first time, and they recorded outside of Finland. They already had a strong stage show but welcomed ideas in improving it further.<ref name=\"therasmus.com\"/>\n\n===''Into'' and Hell of a Collection (2001\u20132002)===\n{{main|Into (album)|Hell of a Collection}}\nIn October 2001, The Rasmus released ''[[Into (album)|Into]],'' their fourth studio album, and first album for Playground Music. It was the first The Rasmus to be released in other European countries such as France and Spain. The album reached No.&nbsp;1 in the Finnish album charts and spawned the singles \"F-F-F-Falling\", \"Chill\", \"Madness\" and \"Heartbreaker/Days\". All of these were released in 2001 apart from Heartbreaker/Days, which was released in 2002. For this fact and the name's change, some fans consider this album the first of \"The Rasmus\". In 2001 they also released their first compilation album, ''[[Hell of a Collection]]'', composed of eighteen songs, nearly all of which were revamped versions of songs from the previous three albums. The exceptions are the final track, \"Liquid\" (Demo), which is a demo tape of their hit song \"Liquid\", and the songs \"F-F-F-Falling\" and \"Chill\" which were the first new songs released after Aki replaced Janne. They won four EMMAs in 2002 for Best Group, Best Album, Best Pop/Rock Album and Best Song for \"F-F-F-Falling\".<ref name=\"therasmus.com\"/>\n\n===''Dead Letters'' and Live Letters (2003\u20132004)===\n{{main|Dead Letters}}\nOn 21 March 2003, The Rasmus released their fifth studio album, ''[[Dead Letters]]''.

However, a few of the album's songs, such as \"Ten Black Roses\", \"The Fight\", and \"Lost and Lonely\", contain symphonic rock/metal elements. The album spawned a second single \"Justify\" in 2009.

The material premiered the annual EMMA Gala on 26 February 2011. Yl\u00f6nen stated that he wanted several songs that didn't fit The Rasmus to be released as a major record rather than a demo. The album was self-produced with their record label Dynasty Recordings. The album charted at a peak of No.2 on the Finnish album charts.
