Their recording contract was signed in the spring of 1964 with Ridgepride, which then leased their recordings to Decca. They released a single, \"Steal Your Heart Away\", that year which failed to chart. They also appeared on the cult TV programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' singing the uptempo 'B' side \"Lose Your Money (But Don't Lose your Mind)\". But it was their second single, \"[[Go Now]]\" (released later that year), that launched their career, being promoted on TV with one of the first purpose-made promotional films in the pop era, produced and directed by [[Alex Wharton]]. The single became a hit in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (where it remains their only No. 1 single)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/moody-blues/|title=Moody Blues - British Invasion Bands|work=britishinvasionbands.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824084822/http://www.britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/moody-blues/|archive-date=24 August 2010}}</ref> and in the United States, where it reached No. 10. The band encountered management problems after the chart-topping hit and subsequently signed to Decca Records in the UK (London Records in the US) directly as recording artists. A four-track [[extended play]] release titled \"The Moody Blues\" featuring both sides of their first two Decca singles was issued in a colour picture sleeve in early 1965.\n\nTheir debut album ''[[The Magnificent Moodies]]'', produced by [[Denny Cordell]] with a strong [[Beat music|Merseybeat]]/[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] flavour, was released on Decca in mono only in 1965. It contained the hit single together with one side of classic R&B covers, and a second side with four Laine-Pinder originals.\n\nAlex Wharton left the management firm, and the group released a series of relatively unsuccessful singles. They enjoyed a minor British hit with a cover of \"I Don't Want To Go on Without You\" (No. 33) in February 1965, while the Pinder-Laine original \"From the Bottom of My Heart (I Love You)\" produced by Denny Cordell (with a vocal choral sound towards the conclusion that anticipated their sound on \"Nights in White Satin\") was issued as a UK single in May 1965 and did a little better (No. 22). But then \"Everyday\", another Pinder-Laine song, stalled at No. 44 in October 1965 and no further British singles were released for about a year. The group was still in demand for live gigs, though, and they had chart success in the US and in Europe during those months when \"Bye Bye Bird\" (Decca AT 15048) was lifted from their album in December 1965 as an overseas single in France (No. 3).\n\nIn June 1966, Warwick retired from the group and the music business. He was briefly replaced by Rod Clark,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rod Clark page 1 |url=http://www.themoodyblues.co.uk/page46.htm  |website=themoodyblues.co.uk}}</ref> but in early October, Denny Laine also departed from the group,<ref>\"Denny left on Saturday and we\u00b4re not sure what we\u00b4re going to do. We\u00b4re waiting to see [[Brian Epstein]] to talk things over with him.\" Ray Thomas, as quoted by ''Record Mirror'', 8 October 1966: {{cite web |url=http://www.webwriter.f2s.com/moody/tourbooks/1966tour.htm |title=Moody Blues - 1966 Concerts |access-date=22 December 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716143526/http://www.webwriter.f2s.com/moody/tourbooks/1966tour.htm |archive-date=16 July 2014  }}.

Clark joined [[The Rockin' Berries]].\n\nIn the November 1966 issue of ''Hit Week'', Dutch interviewers Hans van Rij and Emie Havers presented their story, saying the Moody Blues had been in the process of recording their second album, ''Look Out'',<ref>see article {{cite web |url=http://themoodyblues.co.uk/p0001160.jpg |title=Ex Moody Blues Recording Session |access-date=3 April 2022 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217133235/http://themoodyblues.co.uk/p0001160.jpg |archive-date=17 December 2014  }} on Tony Brown\u00b4s website, taken from ''Hit Week #10'', November 1966, page 5.</ref> with Cordell producing. The album was shelved and \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (released as a single c/w \"Fly Me High\" some months later) is the only song mentioned in the article but the authors say Laine had written all of the material, with Thomas, Pinder and Clark (still the bass player) singing lead vocals as well.\n\nA final \"Mark One\" Moodies single, Pinder-Laine's \"Life's Not Life\", was scheduled for release in January 1967 (Decca F 12543) c/w \"He Can Win\" even though Laine<ref>\"I wasn't content to just carry on this gig just to bring money in. Our management thing had all fallen apart. We'd gone with Epstein and that was a disaster.\" Laine interviewed by Mark Murley in ''Higher & Higher'' # 36, 1997, page 18.</ref> couldn't perform it live, because the group had relaunched themselves without him a few months earlier. (This single's release is often listed as being cancelled; however, both promo and regular stock copies have been seen over the years.)\n\n===Arrival of Hayward and Lodge===\nThe group re-formed in November 1966. By then, \"Boulevard de la Madeleine\" had made the Belgian charts and won them more fans, which came in handy when they relocated to Belgium for some time. The new members were [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]], their bassist from El Riot who was now finished with his education, and [[Justin Hayward]], formerly of the Wilde Three. Hayward was recommended to Pinder by [[Eric Burdon]] of [[the Animals]] and was endorsed by famed UK singer [[Marty Wilde]], the leader of the Wilde Three. Pinder phoned Hayward after reading his lead guitarist letter, and was impressed when Hayward played him his 45 rpm single \"London is Behind Me\" during their car ride to meet the other members in [[Esher]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAfter financial misfortune and a confrontation with an audience member{{Citation needed|reason=It would be helpful to provide readers with access to more details about these interesting events|date=April 2022}}, the band realised that their style of American blues covers and novelty tunes was not working, and decided to perform primarily their own material. (However, as appearances on French TV show, they continued to do two covers through at least the first half of 1968: the Hayward-sung \"[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]\", and \"[[Bye Bye Bird]]\", with the vocal and harmonica formerly done by Denny Laine now performed by Ray Thomas.) They were introduced to Decca staff producer [[Tony Clarke (record producer)|Tony Clarke]], who produced a recording session which saw Justin Hayward's \"Fly Me High\" and Mike Pinder's older-styled \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (Decca F12607) as the 'Mark Two' Moodies' first single released in May 1967. These picked up both radio airplay and favourable reviews, but failed to chart in the UK. However, the sound gave clues about the direction in which their music would evolve. Their new style, featuring the symphonic sounds of Pinder's [[mellotron]], was introduced on Pinder's song \"Love And Beauty\" (Decca F 12670) which was issued as a single c/w with Hayward's rocker \"Leave This Man Alone\" in September 1967. This too was not a UK hit, but further established their \"new\" Moodies identity. Ray Thomas's flute had been in evidence earlier (\"I've Got a Dream\") on their debut album; however, it became a far more featured instrument from this point onwards as they started incorporating distinct psychedelic influences, which was later developed in a concept album revolving around an archetypal day in the life of [[everyman]].\n\n==Deram Records, Threshold Records, 1967\u20131972==\n===''Days of Future Passed''===\n[[File:Moody Blues, Bestanddeelnr 922-1824.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|The Moody Blues in the Netherlands (1969)]]\nThe Moody Blues' contract with [[Decca Records]] was set to expire and they owed the label several thousand pounds in advances. The second album had never materialised either. They had the support, however, of Decca A&R manager [[Hugh Mendl]], who had been instrumental in the recent establishment of London/Decca's new subsidiary imprint [[Deram Records]]. With Mendl's backing, the Moody Blues were offered a deal to make a [[rock and roll]] version of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s ''[[Symphony No.&nbsp;9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|New World Symphony]]'' to promote the company's new Deramic Stereo Sound audio format<ref name=\"Eder 2009\">{{cite web |last = Eder |first = Bruce |title = The Moody Blues: Biography |publisher = AMG [All Music Group, a subsidiary of Macrovision] |year = 2009 |url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4948/biography|pure_url=yes}} |access-date = 28 July 2009}}</ref> in return for which the group would be forgiven their debt.\n\nThe Moody Blues agreed, but insisted that they be given artistic control of the project, and Mendl (as executive producer) was able to provide this despite Decca's notoriously tight-fisted attitude to their artists.<ref name=\"INDObit\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hugh-mendl-producer-at-decca-records-876686.html Obituaries \u2013 Hugh Mendl: Producer at Decca Records] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517190104/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hugh-mendl-producer-at-decca-records-876686.html |date=17 May 2017 }}; ''[[The Independent]]'', 25 July 2008.</ref> The group was unable to complete the assigned project,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which was abandoned.

Five years later it reached No. 3 on the [[Billboard chart|''Billboard'' chart]] in the US. The LP was a [[song cycle]] or concept album that takes place over the course of a single day.  The album drew inspiration in production and arrangement from the pioneering use of the classical instrumentation by [[the Beatles]], to whom Pinder had introduced the mellotron that year. It took the form to new heights using the [[London Festival Orchestra]],<ref name=pc49>{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 - The British are Coming!

Strings were added to the latter portion of the album version of Hayward's \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\" (absent on the single) but the orchestra and group never performed together on the recording, with the band's rock instrumentation centred on Pinder's mellotron. Despite being a lush concept album, the LP was cut in a very workmanlike manner, with the band recording a particular song, then the track being presented to Peter Knight who quickly composed a suitable \"linking\" orchestral portion, which the Decca musicians (\"London Festival Orchestra\") then recorded. The album was as much an original work by Knight himself as the group. The composing credits were listed on the sleeve as: \"Redwave-Knight\", although Hayward wrote \"Nights in White Satin\" and \"Tuesday Afternoon\", Thomas provided \"Another Morning\" and \"Twilight Time\", Lodge penned \"Peak Hour\" and \"Evening (Time To Get Away)\", and Edge contributed the opening and closing poems (the first \"Morning Glory\" and the latter titled \"Late Lament\") read by Mike Pinder who composed both \"The Sun Set\" and \"Dawn is a Feeling\" (sung by Hayward, with Pinder singing the bridge section).\n\nClarke produced the album, and afterwards continued working with the band. Sometimes known to fans as \"The Sixth Moodie\", he produced their albums and singles for the next eleven years. Engineer Derek Varnals also contributed heavily to the creation of the early Moody's studio sound, working with Pinder and Clarke to create a more symphonic overlapping sound on the mellotron as opposed to the sharp 'cut off' the instrument normally gave, partly achieved by removing all the \"sound effects\" tapes (trains, whistles, cockerel crowing, etc.) and then 'doubling up' the tapes of orchestral instruments' sounds, which combined with Pinder's ability and sensitivity at playing (Pinder having earlier worked for the company that manufactured the mellotron) and Varnals' recording skills at creating an orchestral 'wave' sound that characterised their non-orchestra accompanied sound thereafter.\n\nThe album, plus two singles therefrom, \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\" and \"[[Tuesday Afternoon]]\" (as a medley with \"Forever Afternoon,\" listed as \"Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)\" on the album), took time to find an audience. In the Moody Blues' native Britain, the two singles from the album didn't initially catch on; \"Nights in White Satin\" made only No. 19 on the [[UK Singles Chart|British singles chart]] in early 1968, and \"Tuesday Afternoon\" didn't chart at all. However, the British public learned to appreciate \"Nights in White Satin\" subsequently; it made No. 9 on the UK singles chart on re-issue in December 1972 and No. 14 on the charts on another reissue at the end of 1979, and is now regarded as the Moody Blues signature song by British audiences. In the US, \"Nights in White Satin\" did not make the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1968, although it reached No. 2 on re-release in 1972; \"Tuesday Afternoon\" was more successful on initial release stateside, peaking at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n===''In Search of the Lost Chord''===\nThe 1968 follow-up LP, ''[[In Search of the Lost Chord]]'' included \"[[Legend of a Mind]]\", a song written by Ray Thomas in tribute to [[LSD]] guru [[Timothy Leary]] which encompassed a flute solo performed by Thomas \u2013 four members of the group had taken LSD together at the start of 1967. A promotional film for the song was filmed on location at [[Groot-Bijgaarden Castle]] near [[Brussels]] in Belgium. Lodge provided a two-part song \"House of Four Doors\" set either side of Thomas' epic piece. [[Justin Hayward]] began playing [[sitar]] and incorporating it into Moody Blues music (\"Voices In The Sky\", \"Visions of Paradise\", \"Om\", etc.), having been inspired by [[George Harrison]]. Hayward's \"Voices in the Sky\" charted as a single in the UK (No. 27), as did Lodge's \"Ride My See-Saw\" (No. 42, No. 15 in France) \u2013 still their concert finale number \u2013 which featured Pinder's non-album song \"A Simple Game\" as the 'B' side. Pinder's \"[[The Best Way to Travel]]\" was another high point, as was his closing song \"Om\" (sung by Pinder and Thomas, again featuring Hayward on sitar). Graeme Edge found a significant secondary role in the band as a writer of poetry, and some of their early albums from the late 1960s began with various band members reciting poems by Edge that were conceptually related to the lyrics of the songs that  followed. Edge narrated his brief \"Departure\" poem on \"Lost Chord\", although Pinder recited the majority of Edge's poetry, as according to Edge, he had the best voice for it due to smoking more cigarettes and drinking more [[whisky]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/39954/breathe-deep-the-moody-blues-cruise-graeme-edge-gets-moody/|title=Moody Blues drummer Graeme Edge interviewed - TechnologyTell|work=TechnologyTell|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129021244/http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/39954/breathe-deep-the-moody-blues-cruise-graeme-edge-gets-moody/|archive-date=29 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''On the Threshold of a Dream''===\nOn 1969's ''[[On the Threshold of a Dream]]'', Hayward, Edge and Pinder share the opening narration on Edge's \"In The Beginning\", leading into Hayward's \"Lovely To See You\". His \"Never Comes the Day\" was issued as a UK single, while Thomas' wry observations of life in \"Dear Diary\" and \"Lazy Day\" were striking features. Pinder contributed the closing track on side one, \"So Deep Within You\". Side two closed with the \"Dream Sequence\", Edge's poem \"The Dream\" leading into Pinder's \"Have You Heard?\" parts I and II with the two parts separated by his classically themed instrumental piece \"The Voyage\".\n\n===''To Our Children's Children's Children''===\nThe band's music continued to become more complex and symphonic, with heavy amounts of [[reverberation]] on the vocal tracks, resulting in 1969's ''[[To Our Children's Children's Children]]''&nbsp;\u2013 a concept album inspired by the first moon landing. The opening track \"Higher and Higher\" saw Pinder simulate a rocket blast-off on keyboards, then narrate Edge's lyrics. Thomas' \"Floating\" and \"Eternity Road\" stood out, as did Hayward's \"Gypsy\" and a rare Pinder-Lodge collaboration \"Out and In\". Lodge provided his two-part \"Eyes of a Child\" and \"Candle of Life\" while Pinder contributed \"Sun is Still Shining\". The album closed with \"[[Watching and Waiting]]\", composed by Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward and sung by Hayward. It was during 1969 that the band established their own label \"Threshold\" under licence to Decca Records. ''To Our Children's Children's Children'' was the first of their albums to be released on their own label. The song \"Watching and Waiting\" was issued as a single on the Threshold label, but failed to chart.\n\n===''A Question of Balance''===\nAlthough the Moodies had by now defined a somewhat [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] style and helped to define the [[progressive rock]] (then also known as 'art rock') sound, the group decided to record an album that could be played in concert, losing some of their full-blown sound for ''[[A Question of Balance]]'' (1970). This album, reaching No. 3 in the American charts and No. 1 in the British charts, was indicative of the band's growing success in America. Hayward's \"Question\" (in a different version) was issued as a single, reaching No. 2 in the UK. Justin Hayward began an artful exploration of guitar tone through the use of numerous [[effects pedals]] and [[distortion (music)|fuzzboxes]] and developed for himself a very melodic buzzing guitar-solo sound. The Moody Blues had by now become a bill-topping act in their own right. They appeared twice at the famous [[Isle of Wight Festival]] (A DVD of their 1970 performance has been released). Pinder's \"Melancholy Man\" (a No.1 single in France) stood out beside Hayward's \"Question\" on the 1970 album.\n\n===''Every Good Boy Deserves Favour'' and ''Seventh Sojourn''===\nFor their next two albums, ''[[Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (album)|Every Good Boy Deserves Favour]]'' (1971) \u2013 from which Hayward's \"[[The Story in Your Eyes]]\" was taken as a US charting single (No. 23) \u2013 and ''[[Seventh Sojourn]]'' (1972) (which reached No. 1 in the US), the band returned to their signature orchestral sound which, while difficult to reproduce in concert, had become their trademark. The title \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" was borrowed, tongue-in-cheek, from a [[mnemonic]] used to remember the musical notes that form the lines of the treble clef: EGBDF. The opening track \"Procession\" was the only item composed by all five band members, a track depicting the \"evolution\" of music, leading into Hayward's \"Story in Your Eyes\". Thomas's reflective \"Our Guessing Game\" and whimsical \"Nice To Be Here\" offset the deeper drama of Hayward's \"You Can Never Go Home\", Lodge's \"One More Time To Live\" and Pinder's \"My Song\". Edge, the long-standing drummer-poet, started writing lyrics intended to be sung, rather than verses to be spoken \u2013 his \"After You Came\" (1971) featured each of the four lead singers taking a vocal section. Then in 1972, Lodge's songs \"Isn't Life Strange?\" (No. 13) and \"[[I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)]]\" (No. 36) were lifted from ''Seventh Sojourn'' as charting UK singles. ''Sojourn'' also saw Pinder using the new [[Chamberlin]] instrument in place of the mellotron and Edge using an electronic drum kit. Pinder's stirring lament \"Lost in a Lost World\" opened this last \"Core Seven\" outing, while his sympathetic ode to Timothy Leary \"When You're a Free Man\", Thomas's romantic \"For My Lady\", and Hayward's serene \"New Horizons\" all stood out.\n\nIn an interview following the release of ''Seventh Sojourn'', Graeme Edge told ''Rolling Stone'': \"We've got two Christians, one Mystic, one Pedantic and one Mess, and we all get on a treat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travellingeternityroad.yuku.com/topic/6649/Threshold-Records-The-Shop?page=2#.VLxJvigrxT5 |title=Threshold Records (The Shop) in Moody Blues Hall Forum |publisher=Travellingeternityroad.yuku.com |access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy this time, other bands were picking up their work. Pinder's songs \"A Simple Game\" (1968) and \"So Deep Within You\" (1969) were successfully covered by [[the Four Tops]], Pinder winning an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for \"A Simple Game\". [[Elkie Brooks]] later covered Hayward's \"Nights in White Satin\". Pinder also appeared on [[John Lennon]]'s ''Imagine'' album in 1971, providing additional percussion on \"I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier (I Don't Want to Die)\". The 1968 to 1972 album sleeves, plus several solo sets up to Ray Thomas's \"Hopes, Wishes & Dreams\" in 1976, were characterised by striking surreal scenic sleeve artwork (mostly gatefold sleeves) by artist Phil Travers.\n\nIn late 1972, a re-issue of the five-year-old \"Nights in White Satin\" became the Moody Blues' biggest US hit, soaring to No. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and becoming a certified million-seller; the song had \"bubbled under\" the Hot 100 charts on its original release. The song also returned to the UK charts, reaching No. 9, ten places higher than its original release in 1967.\n\n===Threshold Records===\nThe Moodies were also among the pioneers of the idea that a successful rock band could promote itself through their own label, following the Beatles' creation of [[Apple Records]]. After their ''[[On the Threshold of a Dream]]'' album (1969), they created [[Threshold Records]], prompted in part by disputes with London/Deram over album design costs (their gatefold record jackets and expensive cover art were not popular with company executives). The idea was for Threshold to produce new albums and deliver them to London/Decca who would act as distributor. The group attempted to build Threshold into a major label by developing new talent&nbsp;\u2013 most notably the UK [[hard rock]] band [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]] and the [[Portland, Oregon]], classical-acoustic sextet [[Providence (band)|Providence]]&nbsp;\u2013 but these efforts were unsuccessful and the Moodies eventually returned to more traditional recording contracts. However, they helped lay groundwork for other major acts to set up similar personal labels and distribution deals, including [[the Rolling Stones]]' own label and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[Swan Song Records|Swan Song]],{{citation needed|reason=according to whom? Very different reasons for this have been stated by members of both groups, none of which reflected the MBs|date=April 2015}} and all of the Moodies' studio releases from 1969 to 1999 bore the Threshold logo on at least one of their format versions.\n\nIn September 1973, the Moody Blues were presented with five gold disks in Australia. At the time, Australia had only awarded eight.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1973/Cash-Box-1973-09-01.pdf|title=Cash Box Magazine|magazine=[[Cash Box magazine|Cash Box]]|via=World Radio History|page=42|date=1 September 1973|access-date=15 November 2021}}</ref>\n\n==A break and solo work, 1974\u20131977==\nIn the spring of 1974, after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of Asia, the group took an extended break, erroneously reported as a break-up at the time, because of band members feeling exhausted and overshadowed (this was said by Hayward in the final issue of ''Higher & Higher'' magazine 2006). Although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists (with Edge also contributing vocally), Hayward was the principal guitarist/vocalist whilst Pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound, arrangements, and overall conceptual direction. Pinder and Thomas also doubled as the Moodies' onstage [[Master of ceremonies|MCs]] (as the ''[[Caught Live + 5]]'' album displayed. ''Caught Live + 5'' was a live double album recorded c. 1969 but released c. 1977 with five previously unreleased studio tracks from 1967 to 1969 added.)\n\nBefore the band's 1973\u201374 world tour (their last with Pinder), Hayward wrote a song called \"Island\" with the intention of including it on a potential follow-up album, which the Moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways. An additional cause of the hiatus were the long tours that had by this time strained Pinder, who needed a rest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album ''[[This Is The Moody Blues]]'', which was released that year.\n\nHayward and Lodge released a duo album, the successful ''[[Blue Jays (album)|Blue Jays]]'' (1975), and a UK chart single, \"Blue Guitar\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with [[10cc]] backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. \"Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album ''The Promise''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pinder|first=Mike|date=|title=History of the Mellotron|url=http://www.mikepinder.com/mellotron.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620130649/http://www.mikepinder.com/mellotron.shtml|archive-date=2007-06-20|access-date=|website=mikepinder.com}}</ref> Edge produced two albums with guitarist [[Adrian Gurvitz]] and his brother Paul Gurvitz, ''Kick Off Your Muddy Boots'' (1975) and ''Paradise Ballroom'' (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured ''[[Songwriter (Justin Hayward album)|Songwriter]]'' (1977), which was followed a few years later by ''[[Night Flight (Justin Hayward album)|Night Flight]]'' (1980), ''[[Moving Mountains (Justin Hayward album)|Moving Mountains]]'' (1985) (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight), ''[[Classic Blue]]'' (1989), ''[[The View from the Hill (album)|The View From The Hill]]'' (1996) and ''[[Live in San Juan Capistrano (album)|Live in San Juan Capistrano]]'' (1998). Lodge released ''[[Natural Avenue (album)|Natural Avenue]]'' (1977); Pinder produced ''[[The Promise (Mike Pinder album)|The Promise]]'' (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter [[Nicky James]], producing ''[[From Mighty Oaks (album)|From Mighty Oaks]]'' (1975) and ''[[Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (album)|Hopes, Wishes and Dreams]]'' (1976).\n\nDuring this time, Hayward recorded \"[[Forever Autumn (song)|Forever Autumn]]\" for the musical version of ''The War of the Worlds''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2017|title=Forever Autumn Justin Hayward UK 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlPLB_X3Bok |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/HlPLB_X3Bok| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|access-date=|website=Youtube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> It was recorded at London's Advision Studios in 1976.

L-R: [[Patrick Moraz]], [[Ray Thomas]], [[Graeme Edge]], [[Justin Hayward]] and [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]]]]\nIn 1977, the group made a decision to record together again, with their record company Decca urging a reunion album. [[London Records]] released a somewhat poorly mixed eight-year-old recording of the band performing at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]], against their artistic wishes. London/Decca did this in an attempt to re-energise public interest in the Moody Blues before their anticipated new album, but by this time Pinder had remarried and started a family in [[California]], so for their reunion recording, the band decamped stateside with producer Clarke. The sessions were marked with tension and division: first there was a fire at the studios they were using, then after quickly relocating to Pinder's home studio, a landslide following torrential rains effectively marooned them, inevitably causing tensions to rise (with Pinder then dropping out before completion).\n\nClarke was also forced to leave for non-musical reasons before the album was completed, but by the spring of 1978 ''[[Octave (album)|Octave]]'' was ready for release. Pinder, citing his young family, excused himself from the touring commitments that were to follow. His decision caused acrimony within the band (notably from Edge). Ray Thomas said Pinder was initially agreeable to touring. His opting out (with a major comeback tour already planned) was a blow to the band. Their management tried to downplay Pinder's absence, notably at a major UK music press party Decca organised, when the top Decca dignitary guest, while making a \"welcome back\" speech, openly referred to \"Mike Pinder being currently absent over in the [[United States|States]]\", much to the band's dismay.\n\n===''Octave'', Pinder departs and the arrival of Moraz, ''Long Distance Voyager'' and ''The Present''===\nFormer [[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Patrick Moraz]] joined the Moody Blues for the Octave World Tour. The album sold well and produced the hits \"[[Steppin' in a Slide Zone]]\" (no. 39 US) and \"[[Driftwood (The Moody Blues song)|Driftwood]]\" (no. 59 US). On ''Octave'', Hayward had four solo compositions, whilst Edge contributed \"I'll Be Level With You\" (a.k.a. \"Little Man\").{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Moody Blues toured the US and Europe during much of 1979. A live CD ''The Moody Blues Live in Seattle 1979'' during the ''Octave'' tour of a concert at [[Key Arena|Seattle Center Coliseum]] recorded on 25 May 1979 was later issued in 2013. By 1980 they were ready to record again, this time bringing in producer [[Pip Williams]]. Moraz was retained as the band's permanent keyboardist, though Pinder had originally understood that he would continue to record even if not touring with the band. Pinder took legal action to prevent the new Moody Blues album from reaching the public without his contributions, but he was not successful, and ultimately, he never returned to the fold. Nevertheless, when released in 1981, ''[[Long Distance Voyager]]'' was a colossal success, reaching No. 1 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' and going Top 5 in the UK. The album yielded two hits, \"[[The Voice (The Moody Blues song)|The Voice]]\", (No. 15 US) written by Hayward, and \"[[Gemini Dream]]\", (No. 12 US) written by Hayward and Lodge. John Lodge's \"Talking out of Turn\" also charted in the US, reaching No. 65. Edge provided \"22,000 Days\" (featuring Thomas as lead voice with Hayward and Lodge) while Thomas' contributions were the final portion of the set with his singing on the final two songs: \"Painted Smile\", \"Reflective Smile\" (a poem narrated by a DJ friend of the band) and \"Veteran Cosmic Rocker\". By now, the mellotron had long been set aside as their primary keyboard instrument on their studio albums and the band embraced a more modern, less symphonic approach, though still retaining a lush keyboard-led sound as Moraz gave a more contemporary edge.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In live concerts, the mellotron was still used heavily by Moraz until the mid-1980s, including on songs that did not originally feature it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X9TKJEDGDQ&feature=channel_video_title |title=Stepping In A Slide Zone \u2013 LIVE |publisher=YouTube |date=15 May 2011 |access-date=17 April 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625014810/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X9TKJEDGDQ&feature=channel_video_title |archive-date=25 June 2014  }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Present (Moody Blues album)|The Present]]'' (1983), again produced by Williams, was less successful than its predecessor, though it spawned a UK Top 40 hit (No. 35) in \"[[Blue World (The Moody Blues song)|Blue World]]\" (No. 62 in the US) and a US Top 40 hit in \"[[Sitting at the Wheel]]\" (which failed to chart in the UK). Videos were also produced for both singles. ''The Present'' was released in conjunction with Talencora Ltd shortly before Decca was bought out by [[Polydor Records]]. The album was supported by The Present Tour.\n\n===''The Other Side of Life'', ''Sur la Mer''===\nIn 1986 they enjoyed renewed success with their album ''[[The Other Side of Life]]'' and in particular with the track \"[[Your Wildest Dreams]]\" \u2013 a US Top 10 hit (and No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary singles chart for two weeks). The song's video garnered a [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Video of the Year award after being frequently featured on [[MTV]]. Newly employed producer [[Tony Visconti]] and Barry Radman, a synth programmer formerly engaged by Moraz, delivered a modern sound the Moodies had been seeking in order to remain competitive with their pop contemporaries. The album's title song also charted in the US, at No. 58.\n\nThe Moody Blues performed live at the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]], which raised money for [[Birmingham Children's Hospital]]. The band played four songs, and later provided backup with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] for [[George Harrison]].\n\nThe Moodies continued their early video-generation success with ''[[Sur La Mer]]'' (1988) and its video and single, \"[[I Know You're Out There Somewhere]]\" (No. 30 US, No. 52 UK, No. 2 US Mainstream Rock), a sequel to \"Your Wildest Dreams\". Their sound took on an ever-increasingly synthetic and technical quality as Moraz and Visconti began using modern sequencers, samplers and drum machines. Hayward and Lodge wrote and sang on most of the songs, as the band came under pressure from their new record company, [[Polydor Records]], to feature those members the label deemed to be the two more commercial looking and sounding ones. This approach stood in contrast to the more equitable five-way songwriting the group had employed with Pinder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://runstop.de/moodies/surlamer.html |title=The Moody Blues: In Review \u2022 Sur La Mer (1988) |publisher=Runstop.de |date=30 September 2006 |access-date=26 August 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715175641/http://runstop.de/moodies/surlamer.html |archive-date=15 July 2015  }}</ref>\n\nBy this point, Ray Thomas was playing a diminished role in the recording studio with the band evolving into a [[synthpop]] act, a genre that was unsuitable for the use of a flute. Thomas provided additional percussion, notably tambourine, plus occasional harmonica, but by this point he was largely relegated to the status of a backup singer. Thomas provided some backing vocals for both ''The Other Side of Life'' and ''Sur La Mer''. Multiple production considerations, however, led Visconti to leave Thomas's vocals off the latter of these two albums.\n\nDespite his diminished participation in the recording process, Thomas' high value remained evident on stage primarily from his continued ability to sing his 1960s and 1970s Moodies classics, and also in flute and keyboard duets he composed with Moraz which were performed only during Moodies' concerts. The band reinforced its concert sound in 1986 with the addition of a second keyboardist. [[Bias Boshell]] was the first, replaced in 1987 by [[Guy Allison]] before Boshell returned by 1990. The group also began to employ female backing singers.\n\n==Late era, 1990\u20132018==\n===Departure of Moraz and Court TV lawsuit===\nIn 1991, halfway through the production of their new studio album, Patrick Moraz did an interview with [[Keyboard (magazine)|''Keyboard'' magazine]] and made some comments in the article that suggested dissatisfaction with his role in the Moodies. His complaints ranged from the Moodies' music becoming too simple in structure to the other members' reluctance to allow him to make significant contributions to the songwriting on their albums. He also was occupied with spending large amounts of time planning a music concert to celebrate his native [[Switzerland]]'s 700th anniversary instead of rehearsing with the Moodies and as a result, he was fired from the group before the project was completed, so Boshell and new keyboardist Paul Bliss were brought in to finish the new album's keyboard tracks. Despite previous credits as an \"official band member\" and being included in group photos on the four '80s studio albums from ''Long Distance Voyager'' to ''Sur La Mer'', subsequent Moodies compilations downplay Moraz to being merely an \"additional keyboardist\" and several band photos have him cropped or airbrushed out, notably on the covers to [[Gold (The Moody Blues album)|''Gold'']] (which did not even mention him in the booklet liner notes, let alone include his picture) and the more recent compilation ''Polydor Years 1986\u20131992''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Moraz later took legal action against the group in the United States and the lawsuit, which he won, was shown on [[Court TV]], but he was awarded only $77,175 in back pay due to accounting slow-ups instead of the $500,000 he sought.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-11-03-ca-1387-story.html|title=SUE ME, SUE YOU: A Los Angeles|date=3 November 1991}}</ref>\n\n===''Keys of the Kingdom''===\n''[[Keys of the Kingdom]]'', released in 1991, had modest commercial success when released and once again, Hayward's songs led off the album, with the new singles \"[[Say It with Love]]\" and \"[[Bless the Wings (That Bring You Back)]].\" Also included was a new ambient flute piece by Ray Thomas entitled \"Celtic Sonant.\" Hayward and Thomas also co-wrote \"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\" to close the album. Lodge made a defining shift in his songwriting on this album, leaving his trademark high-energy rock music, and instead gravitating towards slow love ballads such as \"Lean on Me (Tonight)\" (though he had earlier contributed some songs in this gentler vein such as \"Emily's Song\" for his daughter in 1971, \"Survival\" in 1978, and \"Talking Out of Turn\" in 1981), while his more powerful songs continued with \"Magic\" and the Lennonesque \"Shadows on the Wall\". This gentler trend continued on the two successive Moodies albums. Hayward wrote the driving two-part piece \"Say What You Mean.\" Tony Visconti produced some of the tracks on \"Keys\", as did [[Christopher Neil]] and [[Alan Tarney]]. The ensuing tour saw them invited to play at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. A non-album Hayward-Lodge song cut at these sessions, \"Highway\", was included on the \"Say It with Love\" twelve-inch single and on a [[Time Traveller (The Moody Blues album)|later box set]] and [[Anthology (The Moody Blues album)|compilation album]], while the vinyl album did not include their song \"Once is Enough\" as on the compact disc version.\n\nThe group remained a steady concert draw, and a series of video and audio versions of their 1992 ''[[A Night at Red Rocks|Night at Red Rocks]]'' concert enjoyed great success, particularly as a fund-raiser for American [[Public broadcasting|public television]] where it had been first broadcast. The concert was conducted and arranged by Larry Baird, who has participated in many other bands' orchestral live concerts, such as [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Three Dog Night]], [[Al Jarreau]] and [[Alan Parsons]].\n\nThe group also continued their use of additional musicians on stage and in the studio, but after the two legal suits from both Pinder in 1981 and Moraz in 1992, the band was careful not to recognise future keyboardists as official members. Following on from his contributions as keyboardist on the ''Keys of the Kingdom'' album, Paul Bliss continued to play keyboards for the band live, being promoted to first keyboardist in 2001 (but was replaced in March 2010 after 19 years' continuous service). Thomas and Bliss continued the tradition of a flute/keyboard duet for many tours. After Edge injured himself in 1991, second drummer Gordon Marshall was brought in to back him up; he stayed with the group after Edge returned and remained in the position until autumn of 2015, when he left to play in a Moody Blues cover band, Legend of a Band, and another cover band, Reflections.\n\n===''Strange Times'', 1990s tours===\nFrom 1991 to 1998 the group took a hiatus from recording and spent time trying to perfect the art of performing live with an orchestra. The recording hiatus ended in 1999, with the album ''[[Strange Times (Moody Blues album)|Strange Times]]'', their first album in almost two decades to be more than moderately received by British critics, although Justin Hayward was quoted as saying he was disappointed at the album's chart performance, which was notably less than ''Keys of the Kingdom'' in 1991. It was recorded in [[Recco]], Italy, at Hayward's suggestion, and was the band's first self-produced effort. The album featured keyboards and arrangements from Italian musician Danilo Madonia, who continued to work in-studio with the band. The album opened with \"English Sunset\" a pop song featuring a modern, nearly techno arrangement. The song \"This Is the Moment\" (which is not on ''Strange Times''), which was originally featured in the Broadway production of ''Jekyll and Hyde'', was a minor hit in the US. ''Strange Times'' was also the first album since 1970 to include a new poem by Graeme Edge, \"Nothing Changes\", narrated by Edge, with Hayward then singing the concluding portion of the track, and notably concluded by quoting Mike Pinder's 1968 song title \"A Simple Game\". Also in 1999, the Moody Blues appeared in an episode of ''The Simpsons'' called ''[[Viva Ned Flanders]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media | people=Scully, Mike|year=2007|title=The Simpsons The Complete tenth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Viva Ned Flanders\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> On ''Strange Times'' Ray Thomas appeared vocally with Hayward and Lodge on \"Sooner or Later (Walkin' on Air)\" and his own brief song \"My Little Lovely\", plus provided a vocal snippet and backing vocals on Hayward's \"English Sunset\"; this was his recorded vocal swan song with the band.\n\nIn 2000 the band released ''[[Hall of Fame (The Moody Blues album)|Hall of Fame]]'', a new live concert from the [[Royal Albert Hall]], with a concurrent DVD release. This was taken from the last tour on which Boshell played. He left the live line-up in 2001; Bliss took over first keyboard duties, with his former second keyboard role filled by Bernie Barlow and Julie Ragins when Barlow took maternity leave from 2006 to 2009.\n\nIn 2001 an [[IMAX]] film was released entitled ''Journey into Amazing Caves'', which featured two new songs written and performed by the Moody Blues. The soundtrack also featured Justin Hayward performing vocals and playing guitar throughout. One of these songs, entitled \"Water\", is the Moody Blues' first instrumental studio recording since their 1983 piece \"Hole in the World\" from ''The Present'' LP.\n[[File:MoodyBlues.jpg|left|thumb|Hayward and Lodge live in 2007]]\n\n===Thomas retires, ''December''===\nThe new millennium saw the Moody Blues reducing their touring schedule. At the end of 2002, founding member Ray Thomas retired from the group, reducing the Moody Blues to the trio of Hayward, Lodge and Edge, the last being the only original member. Flautist and rhythm guitarist Norda Mullen was recruited early the following year for their [[North America]]n tour, and worked with the band live and in the studio thereafter. Toward the end of 2003, they released an album entitled ''[[December (The Moody Blues album)|December]]''. The songs included originals and four covers: [[John Lennon]]'s \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\", Mike Batt's \"A Winter's Tale\", \"When A Child is Born\" and [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"White Christmas\". ''December'' was the group's first album to include covers since their 1965 debut album ''[[The Magnificent Moodies]]''.\n\nIn March 2006, the first five of the band's 'Core Seven' albums (the seven albums from ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' to ''[[Seventh Sojourn]]'') were re-released in [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] format with Deluxe Editions, featuring bonus songs and some rare previously unreleased tracks. In April 2007, the last two of these classic albums were re-released by Universal/Threshold. These deluxe editions were unique for an art rock group like the Moodies in that one of their members, Justin Hayward, was the one taken on to do the work, instead of a professional master technician. Hayward stated that he listened to virgin vinyl copies of these albums and used them as reference points for the new compact discs. On 21 May 2007 the Moodies released a 41-track, two-disc compilation of sessions recorded at BBC Studios, various television appearances and a previously 'lost' performance done on the [[Tom Jones (singer)|''Tom Jones Show'']] titled ''[[Live at the BBC: 1967\u20131970]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moodyblues.co.uk/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814045556/http://moodyblues.co.uk/|url-status= dead|title=MoodyBluesToday.com|archive-date=14 August 2007|website=MoodyBluesToday.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://webbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net/~universal/Central/catalogue/blues.html |title=The Moody Blues: Live at the BBC: 1967-1970 |publisher=Webbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net |access-date=26 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195337/http://webbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net/~universal/Central/catalogue/blues.html |archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Final years===\n[[File:MoodyBluesCollage-1000cropped.jpg|thumb|240px|The Moody Blues in concert at the Chumash Casino Resort in [[Santa Ynez, California]] in 2005.<br />L\u2013R: Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Graeme Edge]]\nIn 2007, the now defunct [[Hard Rock Cafe|Hard Rock Park]] theme park in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]], announced the building of a [[dark ride]] entitled \"[[Nights in White Satin: The Trip]]\".

In addition, Hayward took part in the UK tour of ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds]]'' in April 2006, and a second tour in November 2007, also with dates in 2009. The Moody Blues also toured Australia and New Zealand in 2006. Their long-time producer, Tony Clarke, died in January 2010. The band added keyboardist [[Alan Hewitt (musician)|Alan Hewitt]] for their 2010 UK and North American tours.\n\nThey released a new compilation album called ''Timeless Flight'' in 2013.

He stated: \"Despite their success, rock critics rarely took the Moody Blues seriously, a pattern that continued for the next 45 years.\" He also wrote: \"Despite the critical disapproval, the best of the Moody Blues music between 1967 and 1970 possessed grace and beauty. Like [[the Beatles]], they understood how pop songs worked as ensemble pieces. None of them were particularly virtuosic or showy as musicians and their music is refreshingly free of the noodling long[u]eurs that characterised the output of their more self-indulgent contemporaries.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/the-moody-blues-psychedelias-forgotten-heroes | title=The Moody Blues \u2013 psychedelia's forgotten heroes | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Rob | last=Chapman | date=17 September 2015 | access-date=22 August 2016 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921014238/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/the-moody-blues-psychedelias-forgotten-heroes | archive-date=21 September 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, the band were announced as inductees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/moody-blues-justin-hayward-on-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-w513832|title=Moody Blues' Justin Hayward on Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Honor: 'It's Amazing!'|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=13 December 2017|access-date=13 December 2017|first=Andy|last=Greene|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215054025/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/moody-blues-justin-hayward-on-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-w513832|archive-date=15 December 2017}}</ref> On 14 April 2018, they were inducted as part of the 2018 class.
