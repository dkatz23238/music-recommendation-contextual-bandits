Although his mainstream career spanned only seven years, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians in the history of [[blues]] music, and one of the greatest guitarists of all time.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Dallas]], Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven, initially inspired by his elder brother, [[Jimmie Vaughan]]. In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], where he began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit. Vaughan joined forces with [[Tommy Shannon]] on bass and [[Chris Layton]] on drums as Double Trouble in 1978 and established it as part of the [[Austin music scene]]; it soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas. He performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1982, where [[David Bowie]] saw him play. Bowie contacted him for a studio gig which resulted in Vaughan playing blues guitar on the album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983), before being discovered by [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]] who interested major label [[Epic Records]] in signing Vaughan and his band to a record deal. Within months, they achieved mainstream success for the critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Texas Flood]]''. With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours, Vaughan became the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s.\nPlaying his guitar behind his back or plucking the strings with his teeth as [[Jimi Hendrix]] did, he earned fame in Europe, which later resulted in breakthroughs for guitar players like [[Robert Cray]], [[Jeff Healey]], [[Robben Ford]], and [[Walter Trout]], amongst others.\n\nDuring the majority of his life, Vaughan struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame and his marriage to Lenora \"Lenny\" Bailey. He successfully completed rehabilitation and began touring again with Double Trouble in November 1986. His fourth and final studio album ''[[In Step]]'' reached number 33 in the United States in 1989; it was one of Vaughan's most critically and commercially successful releases and included his only number-one hit, \"Crossfire\". He became one of the world's most highly demanded blues performers, and he headlined [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1989 and the [[Beale Street Music Festival]] in 1990.\n\nOn August 27, 1990, Vaughan and four others were [[Death of Stevie Ray Vaughan|killed in a helicopter crash]] in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]], after performing with Double Trouble at [[Alpine Valley Music Theatre]]. An investigation concluded that the cause of the accident was pilot error and Vaughan's family later filed a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit against Omniflight Helicopters which was settled out of court. Vaughan's music continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases and has sold over 15&nbsp;million albums in the United States alone. In 2003, [[David Fricke]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him the seventh greatest guitarist of all time. Vaughan was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2015, along with Double Trouble bandmates [[Chris Layton]], [[Tommy Shannon]], and [[Reese Wynans]].\n\n== Family and early life ==\nVaughan's grandfather, Thomas Lee Vaughan, married Laura Belle LaRue and moved to [[Rockwall County, Texas]] where they lived by [[sharecropping]].<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=5}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|[[File:Robert Hodgen LaRue, Jr..jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Vaughan's great-grandfather, Robert Hodgen LaRue, {{circa|1900s}}|alt=A black and white image (circa 1900s) of an elderly man with white hair and a long beard dressed in a long-sleeved and suspenders standing in front of a tree.]] Vaughan's ancestry has been traced back to his great-grandfather, Robert Hodgen LaRue. Vaughan's paternal grandmother, Laura Belle LaRue, was a sharecropper who moved to Rockwall County from [[Terrell, Texas]], after marrying her husband, Thomas Lee Vaughan, on July 13, 1902. She gave birth to nine children, eight of whom survived infancy. On Sundays, Laura would gather her children around her piano in the living room, singing hymns and popular standards. In 1928, Thomas died from [[Bright's disease]] and left Laura's family to pick cotton for a living at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=3}}</ref>}}\n\nStevie's father, Jimmie Lee Vaughan, was born on September 6, 1921.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2011|p=4}}</ref> Jimmie Vaughan, also known as Jim and Big Jim, dropped out of school at age sixteen and enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]]. After his discharge from the military, he married Martha Jean (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Cook; 1928\u20132009) on January 13, 1950.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=6}}: Jim and Martha meeting at a 7-Eleven in the late 1940s; {{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=8}}: Jim and Martha married in 1950.</ref> They had a son, [[Jimmie Vaughan|Jimmie]], in 1951. Stevie was born at Methodist Hospital on October 3, 1954, in Dallas. Big Jim secured a job as an [[asbestos]] worker. The family moved frequently and lived in other states such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma before ultimately moving to the [[Oak Cliff]] section of Dallas. A shy and insecure boy, Vaughan was deeply affected by his childhood experiences. His father struggled with alcohol abuse and often terrorized his family and friends with his bad temper. In later years, Vaughan recalled that he had been a victim of his father's violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|pp=8\u20139}}: Jim's alcohol abuse and temper; {{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=42}}: Jim's violence</ref> His father died on August 27, 1986, exactly four years before Vaughan himself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/08/28/OBITUARIES/5867525585600/?spt=su|title=Jimmie Lee Vaughan (1921\u20131986)|website=www.upi.com|access-date=February 3, 2022}}</ref>\n\n=== First instruments ===\nIn the early 1960s, Vaughan's admiration for his brother Jimmie resulted in his trying different instruments such as the drums and saxophone.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=10}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|According to Vaughan, his first instrument was a drum set fashioned out of shoe boxes and pie pans, using clothes hangers as drum sticks.

Having spent the past month briefly playing bass with Jimmie in Texas Storm, he had originally auditioned as bassist. Impressed by Vaughan's guitar playing, Scott Phares, the group's original guitarist, modestly became the bassist.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=27}}</ref> In mid-1970, they performed at the [[Adolphus Hotel]] in downtown Dallas, where [[ZZ Top]] asked them to perform. During Liberation's break, Vaughan jammed with ZZ Top on the Nightcaps song \"Thunderbird\". Phares later described the performance: \"they tore the house down. It was awesome. It was one of those magical evenings. Stevie fit in like a glove on a hand.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAttending [[Justin F. Kimball High School]] during the early 1970s, Vaughan's late-night shows contributed to his neglect in his studies, including music theory; he would often sleep during class.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=40}}</ref> His pursuit of a musical career was disapproved of by many of the school's administrators but he was also encouraged by many people, including his art teacher, to strive for a career in art.<ref name=\"Patoski Crawford 41\">{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=41}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Some of Vaughan's cartoons were published in his high school's newspaper.<ref name=\"Patoski Crawford 41\" />}} In his sophomore year, he attended an evening class for experimental art at [[Southern Methodist University]], but left when it conflicted with rehearsal.<ref name=\"Patoski Crawford 41\" /> Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and recalled having  received daily notes from the principal about his grooming.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=24}}</ref>\n\n=== First recordings ===\nIn September 1970, Vaughan made his first studio recordings with the band Cast of Thousands, which included future actor [[Stephen Tobolowsky]]. They recorded two songs, \"Red, White and Blue\" and \"I Heard a Voice Last Night\", for a compilation album, ''A New Hi'', that featured various teenage bands from Dallas.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> In late January 1971, feeling confined by playing pop hits with Liberation, Vaughan formed his own band, Blackbird. After growing tired of the Dallas music scene, he dropped out of school and moved with the band to [[Austin, Texas]], which had more liberal and tolerant audiences. There, Vaughan initially took residence at the Rolling Hills Club, a local blues venue that would later become the Soap Creek Saloon. Blackbird played at several clubs in Austin and opened shows for bands such as [[Sugarloaf (band)|Sugarloaf]], [[Wishbone Ash]], and [[Zephyr (band)|Zephyr]], but could not maintain a consistent lineup.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=61}}: Blackbird opening for Zephyr; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=63}}: Blackbird opening for Sugarloaf; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=65}}: Blackbird opening for Wishbone Ash; {{harvnb|Gill|2010}}: Blackbird's inconsistent lineup.</ref> In early December 1972, Vaughan left Blackbird and joined Krackerjack; he performed with them for less than three months.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|pp=67\u201370}}: \"December 2 is the last entry for Blackbird in Charlie Hatchett's booking records until December 30\u201331.

He was influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Albert King]], [[Lonnie Mack]], [[B.B. King]], [[Freddie King]], [[Albert Collins]], [[Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Otis Rush]], [[Guitar Slim]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Muddy Waters]]. According to nightclub owner [[Clifford Antone]], who opened Antone's in 1975, Vaughan jammed with Albert King at Antone's in July 1977 and it almost \"scared him to death\", saying that \"it was the best I've ever saw Albert or the best I ever saw Stevie\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2010|p=106}} While Albert King had a substantial influence on Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix was Vaughan's greatest inspiration. Vaughan declared: \"I love Hendrix for so many reasons. He was so much more than just a blues guitarist\u2014he played damn well any kind of guitar he wanted. In fact I'm not sure if he even played the guitar\u2014he played music.\"{{sfn|Joseph|1983}} He was also influenced by such jazz guitarists as [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Kenny Burrell]], and [[George Benson]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=155}}\n\nIn 1987, Vaughan listed Lonnie Mack first among the guitarists he had listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcrkPrxj698 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/GcrkPrxj698| archive-date=December 11, 2021 |url-status=live|title=Stevie Ray Vaughan \u2013 Interview with Musique Plus Outakes, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, July 22, 1987|date=March 29, 2012|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Vaughan observed that Mack was \"ahead of his time\"{{sfn|Joseph|1983}} and said, \"I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie\".{{sfn|Menn|1992|p=278}} On another occasion, Vaughan said that he had learned [[tremolo picking]] and vibrato from Mack and that Mack had taught him to \"play guitar from the heart.\"{{sfn|''Request''|1989}} Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978:\n\n{{blockquote|We was in Texas looking for pickers, and we went out to see the Thunderbirds. Jimmie was saying, 'Man, you gotta hear my little brother. He plays all your [songs].' He was playing a little place called the Rome Inn, and we went over there and checked him out. As it would be, when I walked in the door, he was playing 'Wham!' And I said, 'Dadgum.' He was playing it right. I'd been playing it wrong for a long time and needed to go back and listen to my original record. That was in '78, I believe.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=128}}}}\n\nVaughan's relationship with another Texas blues legend, [[Johnny Winter]], was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of ''Boot Hill'', Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, \"Raisin' Cain\", Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. \"We even played together over at Tommy Shannon's house one time.\" Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a blues festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that \"Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him\".{{sfn|Sullivan|2010|p=74}} Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that \"mine's a little bit rawer, I think.\"{{sfn|Kopp|2010}}\n\n== Equipment ==\n{{Main|Stevie Ray Vaughan's musical instruments}}\n\n=== Guitars ===\nVaughan owned and used a variety of guitars during his career. His guitar of choice, and the instrument that he became most associated with, was the [[Fender Stratocaster]], his favorite being a 1963 body with a 1962 neck and [[Pickup (music technology)|pickups]] dated from 1959. This is why Vaughan usually referred to his Stratocaster as a \"1959 Strat\". He explained why he favored this guitar in a 1983 interview: \"I like the strength of its sound. Any guitar I play has got to be pretty versatile. It's got a big, strong tone and it'll take anything I do to it.\"{{sfn|Nixon|1983|p=21}} Vaughan also referred to this instrument as his \"first wife\", or \"Number One\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kkguitar.com/blues-guitarists/stevie-ray-vaughan|title=Stevie Ray Vaughan|work=Keen Kord Guitar|access-date=September 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221234801/http://kkguitar.com/blues-guitarists/stevie-ray-vaughan|archive-date=February 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another favourite guitar was a slightly later Strat he named 'Lenny' after his wife, Lenora. While at a local pawn shop in 1980, Vaughan had noticed this particular guitar, a 1965 Stratocaster that had been refinished in red, with the original sunburst finish peeking through. It also had a 1910 Mandolin inlay just below the bridge. The pawn shop was asking $300 for it, which was way more than Vaughan had at the time. Lenny saw how badly he wanted this guitar, so she got six of their friends to chip in $50 each, and bought it for him. The guitar was presented to him on his birthday in 1980, and that night, after bringing \"Lenny\" (the guitar, and wife) home with him, he wrote the song, \"Lenny\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/texas-flood-mw0000090316|title=Texas Flood \u2013 Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble, Stevie Ray Vaughan &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=May 31, 2021}}</ref> He started using a borrowed Stratocaster during high school and used Stratocasters predominantly in his live performances and recordings, although he did play other guitars, including custom guitars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://srvarchive.com/guitars|title=Stevie's Gear \u2013 Guitars|publisher=SRV Archives|access-date=February 2, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jim Hamilton custom Stevie Ray Vaughan reproduction.jpg|thumb|Jim Hamilton-signed Stevie Ray Vaughan reproduction guitar#01]]\n[[File:Jim Hamilton signature on rear of headstock.jpg|thumb|Jim Hamilton signature on rear of headstock]]\n\nOne of the custom guitars\u2014nicknamed \"Main\"\u2014was built by James Hamilton of Hamiltone Guitars in Buffalo, New York. It was a gift from Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top. Gibbons had commissioned Hamilton to build the guitar in 1979. There were some delays, including having to re-do the mother of pearl inlay of Vaughan's name on the fretboard when he changed his stage name from Stevie Vaughan to Stevie Ray Vaughan. The guitar was presented to him by [[Jimmy Hamilton|Jim Hamilton]] on April 29, 1984. Hamilton recalls that Stevie Ray Vaughan was so happy with the guitar that he played it that night at Springfest on the University of Buffalo campus. It remained one of the main guitars he used on stage and in studio. Vaughan made some alterations to the guitar, including replacing the bronze color Gibson knobs with white Fender knobs, as he preferred the ribbing on the Fender knobs. The pickups had to be changed after the guitar was used in the \"Couldn't Stand the Weather\" video, in which Stevie and \"Main\" were drenched with water, and the pickups were ruined. Vaughan preferred guitar has been summarized as his,\n<blockquote>Number One Strat, which Stevie claimed to be a '59, since that was the date stamped on the back of the pickups\u2026 this was incorrect, however, as guitar tech Rene Martinez (who oversaw SRV's guitars since 1980) found the stamp of 1963 on the body and 1962 on the original neck (the neck was replaced in 1989 after it could no longer be refretted properly; Rene used the neck from another SRV favorite, \"Red\", as it was also a 1962 model). The pickups are also relatively low output, not the hot overwound myth that gained legs during the 80s\u2026 all 3 pickups are rumored to be under 6k ohms output impedance, which would be typical of a 1959 set (the neck pickups tended to be hottest, but not by much). Although the Fender SRV signature model uses Texas Special pickups, which Stevie was heavily involved in the making of, they do not accurately represent the sound of his original Number One.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voodooguitar.net/2016/09/the-srv-gear-guide.html|title=SRV's Gear Guide|publisher=voodooguitar.net|access-date=February 2, 2022}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nVaughan bought many Stratocasters and gave some away as gifts. A sunburst Diplomat Strat-style guitar was purchased by Vaughan and given to his girlfriend Janna Lapidus to learn to play on.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=326}} Vaughan used a custom set of uncommonly heavy strings, gauges .013, .015, .019, .028, .038, .058, and tuned a half-step below [[standard tuning]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.stringjoy.com/stevie-ray-vaughans-guitar-string-gauges/ |title=Stevie Ray Vaughan's Guitar String Gauges |website=Stringjoy |date=December 20, 2014 |access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> He played with so much tension that it was not uncommon for him to separate his fingernail from the quick movement along the strings. The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow super glue, which he used to keep fingernail split from widening while he continued to play. The super glue was suggested by Rene Martinez, who was Stevie's guitar technician. Martinez eventually convinced Stevie to change to slightly lighter strings. He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile (thicker at the top) which was more comfortable for his thumb-over style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements; Vaughan often had his roadie, Byron Barr, obtain custom stainless steel bars made by Barr's father.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=323}}\n\nVaughan was also photographed playing a [[Rickenbacker]] Capri, a [[National String Instrument Corporation|National Duolian]], [[Epiphone]] Riviera, [[Gibson Flying V]], as well as several other models.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|pp=325\u2013326}} Vaughan used a [[Johnny Smith#Gibson Johnny Smith|Gibson Johnny Smith]] to record \"Stang's Swang\", and a [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild 12-string acoustic]] for his performance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' in January 1990.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=326}} On June 24, 2004, one of Vaughan's Stratocasters, the aforementioned \"Lenny\" strat, was sold at an auction to benefit [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Crossroads Centre]] in [[Antigua]]; the instrument was bought by [[Guitar Center]] for $623,500.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=324}}\n\n=== Amplifiers and effects ===\nVaughan was a catalyst in the revival of vintage amplifiers and effects during the 1980s. His loud volume required powerful and robust amplifiers. Vaughan used two black-face [[Fender Super Reverb]]s, which were crucial in shaping his clear overdriven sound. He would often blend other amps with the Super Reverbs, including black-face [[Fender Vibroverb]]s,{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=326}} and brands including [[Dumble Amplifiers|Dumble]] and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]], which he used for his clean sound.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|pp=326\u2013327}}\n\nWhile an [[Ibanez Tube Screamer]] and a [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] wah-wah pedal were his mainstay effects,{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=327}} Vaughan experimented with a range of effects. He used a [[Fender Vibratone]],{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=326}} designed as a [[Leslie speaker]] for electric guitars which provided a warbling chorus effect; it can be heard on the track \"Cold Shot\". He used a vintage Dallas Arbiter [[Fuzz Face]] that can be heard on ''[[In Step]]'', as well as an [[Octavia (effects pedal)|Octavia]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=327}} The Guitar Geek website provides a detailed illustration of Vaughan's 1985 equipment set up based on interviews with his guitar tech and effects builder, [[C\u00e9sar D\u00edaz (guitarist)|Cesar Diaz]].<ref>Cooper, Adam (2000).
