The band's only constant members are [[Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez]] (guitar, producer, direction) and [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]] (vocals, lyrics), whose partnership forms the core of the band. The band's current line-up also includes founding member [[Eva Gardner]] (bass), Omar's brother [[Marcel Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez]] (keyboards, synths, percussion), Linda-Philom\u00e8ne Tsoungui (drums) and [[Leo Genovese]] (keyboards, saxophone).\n\nKnown for their energetic live shows and [[concept album]]s, The Mars Volta formed following the break-up of Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez and Bixler-Zavala's previous band, [[At the Drive-In]]. Seeking to experiment and expand their sound, Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez and Bixler-Zavala recruited Gardner, [[Isaiah \"Ikey\" Owens]] (keyboards), [[Jon Theodore]] (drums) and [[Jeremy Ward (musician)|Jeremy Ward]] (sound manipulation) to form The Mars Volta. The band released their debut EP, ''[[Tremulant (EP)|Tremulant]]'', in 2002, with Gardner leaving the band prior to recording their debut album, ''[[De-Loused in the Comatorium]]''. She was replaced by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bass guitarist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] for the sessions. The [[Rick Rubin]]-produced album received widespread critical acclaim upon its release in 2003.\n\nThe band's second studio album, ''[[Frances the Mute]]'' (2005), was self-produced by Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez and was the first to feature longterm members [[Juan Alderete]] (bass) and Marcel Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez. The album debuted at #4 on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]] and became the band's biggest commercial success, selling over 500,000 copies in the US and achieving Gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. The band's third studio album, ''[[Amputechture]]'', was released in 2006 and was the last album to feature Theodore. In 2008, the band released ''[[The Bedlam in Goliath]]'', a concept album inspired by the band's turbulent experiences with a [[ouija]]-type talking board. The album's first single, \"[[Wax Simulacra]]\" was awarded a [[Grammy Award]] in 2009 for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=114003|title=The Mars Volta Wins 'Best Hard Rock' Grammy for 'Wax Simulacra'|date=February 8, 2009|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|access-date=February 9, 2009}}</ref> The band released its fifth album, ''[[Octahedron (album)|Octahedron]]'', in June 2009. \n\nFollowing the release of their sixth album, ''[[Noctourniquet]]'' (2012), and a run of reunion shows with At the Drive-In, The Mars Volta entered a hiatus in September 2012.

And Mars, we're just fascinated by science fiction so and it's something that ultimately looked as in anything I write, its meaning is always up to the listener.

The lineup for their first public show at Chain Reaction in [[Anaheim]], California was Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez, Bixler-Zavala, Owens, Gardner, Ward, and drummer [[Jon Theodore]]. This lineup recorded three more tracks with Alex Newport, which became the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Tremulant (EP)|Tremulant]]'', released in early 2002 by [[Gold Standard Laboratories]].\n\nAfter the demise of At the Drive-In, Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez and Bixler-Zavala found themselves once again starting from the ground up, touring and performing in smaller venues. In their early years The Mars Volta were characterized by chaotic live shows and heavy drug use.<ref name=\"harp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=4807|title=The Mars Volta: Spaced Out|last=Kelley|first=Trevor|website=[[Harp (magazine)|Harp]]|access-date=July 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031055306/http://www.harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=4807|archive-date=October 31, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===''De-Loused in the Comatorium'' (2003\u20132004)===\n{{Main|De-Loused in the Comatorium}}\nFollowing ''[[Tremulant (EP)|Tremulant]]'', The Mars Volta continued touring with a fluid line-up while preparing to record their debut full-length album ''[[De-Loused in the Comatorium]]'', produced with [[Rick Rubin]] and released on June 24, 2003. Whereas ''Tremulant'' had no general theme (except the prophetic mentioning) ''De-Loused'' was a unified work of [[speculative fiction]] telling the first-person story of someone in a drug-induced coma, battling the evil side of his mind. Though lyrically obscure, The Mars Volta stated in interviews that the album's protagonist is based on their late friend Julio Venegas, or ''\"Cerpin Taxt\"'', an [[El Paso]] poet and artist who went into a coma for several years after a deliberate drug overdose, recovered and later committed suicide.<ref name=\"T\"/> He died jumping from the Mesa Street overpass onto Interstate-10 in El Paso during afternoon rush-hour traffic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} (Venegas' death was also referenced in the At the Drive-In song \"Embroglio\" from their album ''[[Acrobatic Tenement]]''.)\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Aquarian Weekly]]'' in 2008, Cedric Bixler-Zavala said about working with Rubin, \"Rick really over-simplified some of the parts that we thought were unique, and just made them very digestible. He's got this thing about representing the common man's ears\u2014I'd rather jab the common man's ears. If we don't, we'll never get to a place where future music exists.\"<ref name=\"The Aquarian Weekly\">[http://www.theaquarian.com/2008/01/30/the-mars-volta-happy-pastors/ ''The Happy Pastors''], by Daniel Alleva, [http://www.theaquarian.com The Aquarian Weekly], January 30, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe Mars Volta had no official bassist during the recording session, but [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] (of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]) played bass on nine of the album's ten songs, with [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]] playing [[double bass]] on \"[[Televators]]\". Flea's bandmate [[John Frusciante]] also contributed additional guitar, synthesizer and backing vocals to \"Cicatriz ESP\". After several temporary replacements, a permanent bassist for the band was found in [[Juan Alderete]] (formerly of [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]]).\n\nDespite limited promotion, ''De-Loused'' earned strong reviews, and appeared on several 'year-end best-of' lists. The album remains The Mars Volta's best-seller, with over 500,000 copies sold. Rolling Stone ranked a track from ''De-Loused'', \"Drunkship of Lanterns\", the 91st Best Guitar Song Ever. The band later released a limited-edition storybook version of the album, available by download from the Gold Standard Laboratories website. The book speaks of Cerpin Taxt (Julio Venegas) and his suicide.\n\nWhile on tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers in support of the album, founding member [[Jeremy Ward (musician)|Jeremy Ward]] died of a [[heroin overdose]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"T\"/> The band had canceled the tour's second leg, and the first single from ''De-Loused'' was later dedicated to Ward. It was this event which finally convinced band leaders Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez and Bixler-Zavala to purportedly quit using [[opioids]].<ref name=\"harp\"/> Bixler-Zavala recalled: \"One day, we were all getting high, and Jeremy asked me if I could see he had worms in his head. I never touched the stuff again. His passing was the final nail in the coffin. We never went back.\"<ref name=\"T\"/>\n\n===''Frances the Mute'' (2005)===\n{{Main|Frances the Mute}}\nAs the band resumed touring to support ''De-Loused'', they added Marcel Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez (Omar's brother) on percussion. Work on their second album began in 2004. That year the band received the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] Vanguard Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/eventsawards/awards/vanguard/ |title=ASCAP Vanguard Award |publisher=ascap.com |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Mars Volta.jpg|thumb|right|Live at [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] \u2013 [[Amsterdam]] October 16, 2005]]\n\nIn 2005, the band released ''[[Frances the Mute]]''. The story given by the band on the album's concept concerns a diary that had been found in a repossessed car by late sound technician Jeremy Ward, while working as a repo-man. The author of the diary is unknown but appeared to be someone who was adopted and was searching for their birth parents, and who may have suffered from mental illness caused by the death of a loved one. The lyrics for each track on the album are loosely based on characters and life events described in this person's diary.\n\n''Frances the Mute'' started as a bigger commercial hit than ''De-Loused'', moving 123,000 copies in its first week, and debuting at No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard album charts]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/63797/50-cent-massacres-album-chart-competition |title=50 Cent Massacres Album Chart Competition |last=Whitmire |first=Margo |date=March 9, 2005 |magazine=Billboard  |access-date=April 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001054514/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/63797/50-cent-massacres-album-chart-competition |archive-date=October 1, 2014 }}</ref> Reviews of ''Frances'' were generally positive (with a 75 on Metacritic) if somewhat polarized; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it \"a feverish and baroque search for self that conjures up the same majesty and gravity as [[Led Zeppelin]] three decades before\", and even the detractors of ''Frances the Mute'' generally praised the band's musical abilities.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/050228/33/1xj49.html|title=The Mars Volta \u2013 ''Frances the Mute''|last=Gill|first=Jaime|date=February 28, 2005|website=Reviews|publisher=[[Yahoo!

He used a method that [[Miles Davis]] used to evoke great performances from bandmates: refusing to let the other members hear each other's parts, or the context of their own part, thereby forcing them to play each part as if it were a self-sufficient song. In order to accomplish this, the musicians recorded to the pulse of a [[metronome]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} While in the studio, Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez recruited [[Adri\u00e1n Terrazas-Gonz\u00e1lez]] to play saxophone, [[flute]], and additional wind instruments for the album. Terrazas-Gonz\u00e1lez was added as a permanent member to The Mars Volta while touring in support of ''Frances the Mute''.\n\nSeveral songs written during the original recording sessions for the album never made the final cut. Notably, the self-titled 14-minute epic \"[[Frances the Mute]]\", which was originally to open the album and was ultimately supposed to decode the album's concept, was not included due to time constraints. Instead the track was featured as a b-side to the single release for \"[[The Widow (song)|The Widow]]\".\n[[File:The Mars Volta live 2005.jpg|275px|thumb|left|Live at [[Birmingham Academy]] November 30, 2005 with drummer [[Jon Theodore]]]]\nOn May 21, 2005, instead of playing a traditional [[set list|set]] at [[KROQ Weenie Roast|KROQ's Weenie Roast Festival]], the band played a 50-minute improvisation jam that was jokingly named on-the-spot as \"Abortion, The Other White Meat\" by Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez. In keeping with The Mars Volta's tradition of testing and developing new work live, parts of \"Abortion\" later appeared on \"Population Council's Wet Dream\" from Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez's 2009 album ''[[Old Money (album)|Old Money]]''.\n\nMidway through their headlining U.S. tour, former [[At the Drive-In]] member [[Paul Hinojos]] left the band [[Sparta (band)|Sparta]] to join The Mars Volta, claiming, \"My time with Sparta has run its course, and simply wasn't fun anymore.\" Hinojos joined as rhythm guitarist and became the band's sound manipulator, the position previously held by the late Ward. Hinojos had previously toured with The Mars Volta in 2003 and 2004.\n\nDuring mid-2005, the band toured in support of the album with [[System of a Down]] and curated the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival at [[Camber Sands]] in England.<ref name=\"ATP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/archive/archived_event.php?archive=19|title=2005 \u2013 Curated by Mars Volta \u2013 Camber Sands, UK |publisher=[[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]]|access-date=July 28, 2008}}</ref> In addition, a full-length live album named ''[[Scabdates]]'' was released on November 8, 2005.\n\n===''Amputechture'' (2006\u20132007)===\n{{Main|Amputechture}}\nUpon finishing the majority of touring for ''Frances the Mute'' in fall 2005, Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez traveled to [[Amsterdam]] and wrote what became ''[[Amputechture]]'', which was released on September 8, 2006, in Europe, on September 9, 2006, in [[Australia]] and on September 12, 2006, in the U.S. Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez spent much of his time in Amsterdam working on and performing various solo projects most notably under the name \"[[Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez#The Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group|Omar Rodriguez Quintet]]\". During this time Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez also composed the score to the film ''[[El B\u00fafalo de la Noche (film)|El B\u00fafalo de la Noche]]'', which was written and directed by [[Guillermo Arriaga]] and Jorge Hernandez Aldana respectively. The Mars Volta as a whole performed the score.\n\n''Amputechture'' was produced by Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez and mixed by [[Rich Costey]]. [[Jeff Jordan (painter)|Jeff Jordan]] provided the artwork, making it their first album not to feature the [[Graphic designer|work]] of [[Storm Thorgerson]]. It was once again a concept album, but rather than telling a story, the album was a series of vignettes, with each song telling a different story. It became the last album with drummer Jon Theodore, whom Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez fired before touring in support of the album. Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez said in an interview with an Italian fan site that Theodore was the only member in the band who was not happy playing live and brought down the moods of the rest.{{citation needed|reason=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_KtT8XtQQI|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[File:MarsVoltaJohnFrusciante.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The Mars Volta playing with [[John Frusciante]] in [[Toronto]] on September 25, 2006]]\n[[John Frusciante]] was featured on every track on ''Amputechture'', except for \"Asilos Magdalena\". Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez contributed the solos and riffs where the guitar work needed to be doubled. Bixler-Zavala said in an interview, \"...he taught Frusciante all the new songs and Frusciante tracked guitars for us so Omar could sit back and listen to the songs objectively. It's great that he wants to help us and do that.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nOn July 28, 2006, the drummer's spot was filled by [[Blake Fleming]], formerly of [[Laddio Bolocko]], [[Dazzling Killmen]], and the very first Mars Volta demos. A new song titled \"Rapid Fire Tollbooth\" was debuted live on September 22, 2006, in Chicago, Illinois, as reported by fans and attendees of the show who had received set lists from the stage. The song originally appears on Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez's solo album ''[[Se Dice Bisonte, No B\u00fafalo]]''. The song eventually evolved into the track \"Goliath\" from the band's fourth studio album.\n\nOn September 25, 2006, The Mars Volta played a unique set on the opening night of a double-header in Toronto, Ontario. Cedric Bixler-Zavala fell ill and could not perform, so The Mars Volta played with [[John Frusciante]] on third guitar. The set consisted of over 47 minutes of instrumental material, including a lengthy cover of the [[Pink Floyd]] composition \"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]\". On October 17, 2006, while opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the band played with drummer [[Deantoni Parks]] as Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez had fired Fleming because of complications within the band. Parks remained with the band only until the conclusion of the Japanese tour because of his prior commitments with other bands. On October 31, 2006, in Cleveland, Ohio, as Parks could not perform, The Mars Volta played an approximately 40-minute improvisation set as a rehearsal for another drummer, [[Thomas Pridgen]].\n\nOn a 2006 episode of [[The Henry Rollins Show]], The Mars Volta performed \"Tetragrammaton\" and \"Day of the Baphomets\" in a rare television performance.
