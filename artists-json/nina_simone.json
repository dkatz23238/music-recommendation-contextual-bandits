The idea was to bring Simone to Nijmegen to relax and get back on track. A daily caretaker, Jackie Hammond from London, was hired for her. She was known for her temper and outbursts of aggression. Unfortunately, the tantrums followed her to Nijmegen. Simone was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] by a friend of De Bruin, who prescribed [[Trilafon]] for her. Despite the miserable illness, it was generally a happy time for Simone in Nijmegen, where she could lead a fairly anonymous life. Only a few recognized her, but most Nijmegen people did not know who she was. Slowly but surely her life started to improve, and she was even able to make money from the Chanel commercial after a legal battle. In 1991 Nina Simone exchanged Nijmegen for the more lively [[Amsterdam]], where she lived for two years with friends and Hammond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://petesboogie.blogspot.com/2015/12/nina-simone-in-nijmegen.html|language=nl|last=Schong|first=Peter|date=December 11, 2015|website=petesboogie.blogspot.com|title=Nina Simone in Nijmegen: toevluchtsoord aan de Waal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gelderlander.nl/nijmegen/het-nijmeegse-geluk-van-nina-simone~a158f193/|title=Het Nijmeegse geluk van Nina Simone|work=De Gelderlander|language=nl|date=August 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1993\u20132003: Final years, illness and death===\nIn 1993, Simone settled near [[Aix-en-Provence]] in southern France ([[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://noisey.vice.com/nl/article/rjmggx/de-nederlandse-jaren-van-nina-simone |title=''De Nederlandse jaren van Nina Simone'' (\"The Dutch Years of Nina Simone\") |last=Fortuin |first=Fiona |date=November 27, 2015 |website=Noisey |language=nl |access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref><!-- help provide further verified information about Simone's later life. --> In the same year, her final album, ''[[A Single Woman (album)|A Single Woman]]'', was released.
