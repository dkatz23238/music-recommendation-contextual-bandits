In recent years, the duo has become more candid with their fanbase online.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Formation ===\n[[Garry Cobain]] and [[Brian Dougans]] met in the mid-1980s while studying electronics at university in [[Manchester]], England. Dougans had already been making electronic music, working between [[Glasgow]] and Manchester, when the pair first began working together in local clubs. In 1988, Dougans embarked on a project for a graphic studio ''Stakker'', which resulted with a single \"[[Stakker Humanoid]]\" that reached number 17 in the UK charts, introducing [[acid house]] to mainstream audience.<ref name=\"Stuart Aitken\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/11/stakker-humanoid-25th-anniversary-acid-house |title=Stakker Humanoid: how the Future Sound of London won hearts and minds |date=11 November 2013|author=Stuart Aitken|website=Theguardian.co.uk }}</ref> Cobain contributed to the accompanying album ''[[Global (Humanoid album)|Global]]''.\n\nIn the following years the pair produced music under a variety of aliases, releasing a number of singles and EPs, including \"[[Q (song)|Q]]\" and \"[[Metropolis (Metropolis song)|Metropolis]]\", later featured on the 1992 compilation ''Earthbeat''.\n\nIn 1992, Cobain and Dougans released their debut, techno-driven album together, ''[[Accelerator (The Future Sound of London album)|Accelerator]]''. It was followed by \"[[Papua New Guinea (song)|Papua New Guinea]]\", a single based on a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from \"[[Within the Realm of a Dying Sun|Dawn of the Iconoclast]]\" by [[Dead Can Dance]], and a bassline from \"Radio Babylon\" by [[Meat Beat Manifesto]]. In 1992, after the chart success and several accolades<ref>{{cite web |date=3 February 2007 |title=Q Magazine SE - 1001 Best Songs Ever |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/q1001_songs.htm |access-date=22 March 2009 |website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Richard Buskin |title=Classic Tracks: The Future Sound Of London 'Papua New Guinea' |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov06/articles/classictracks_1106.htm |access-date=22 March 2009 |website=Soundonsound.com}}</ref> of \"Papua New Guinea\", [[Virgin Records]] signed the band with free rein to experiment.\n\nIn 1993, the duo released an ambient album ''[[Tales of Ephidrina]]'', the first under the alias Amorphous Androgynous. The focus on texture and mood, while retaining dance beats, was well received. The album was released on Quigley, the band's own short-lived offshoot of Virgin. The band begun experimenting with radio performance, broadcasting three-hour radio shows to Manchester's Kiss FM from their studio.\n\n===''Lifeforms'' and the ''ISDN'' tour===\nIn 1993, the band released \"[[Cascade (song)|Cascade]],\" a nearly 40 minutes single made the UK top 30. It was followed in 1994 by the album ''[[Lifeforms (The Future Sound of London album)|Lifeforms]]'', released to critical acclaim and a top 10 hit on the UK album chart. The [[Lifeforms (song)|eponymous single]] featured [[Elizabeth Fraser]] of the [[Cocteau Twins]] on vocals. The record introduced samples of tropical array of exotic sounds. Dougan's father involvement in the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] had a heavy influence on ''Lifeforms''. Often asked for [[Brian Eno]] being their influence, Cobain and Dougans said they were about looking forward not the past. To them, it was a new work rather than just another Eno-type ambient album.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/future-sound-london |title=Future Sound of London : Music News Feature &#124; Clash Music |publisher=Clash Music |access-date=22 March 2009}}</ref>{{listen\n| filename     = Future Sound of London - Dead Cities - Her Face Forms in Summertime.ogg\n| title        = \"Her Face Forms in Summertime\" (1996)\n| description  = Sample of \"Her Face Forms in Summertime\" from [[Dead Cities (album)|''Dead Cities'']].\n| format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nThat year, the Future Sound of London released a limited-edition album ''[[ISDN (album)|ISDN]]'', which featured live broadcasts made over [[ISDN]] lines to various radio stations worldwide to promote ''Lifeforms'', including [[The Kitchen]], an avant-garde performance space in New York, and several appearances on BBC ''Sessions'' hosted by [[John Peel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondthought.co.uk/fsol/live.htm |title=The Future Sound of London: Welcome to the Galaxial Pharmaceutical |website=Secondthought.co.uk |access-date=22 March 2009}}</ref> The shows featured ambient soundscapes with previously released material performed alongside unheard tracks. One performance for [[BBC Radio 1]] featured [[Robert Fripp]]. The tone of ''ISDN'' was darker and more rhythmic than ''Lifeforms''. The band wanted to achieve something epic and grand, but no matter how much technological or personal support they had they never got to truly do what they envisioned. Cobain admited that the 90s were a time of frustration because the technology didn't fit the band's ideas.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.barcodezine.com/The%20Future%20Sound%20Of%20London%20Interview.htm |title=The Future Sound Of London Interview |website=Barcodezine.com |access-date=22 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927235850/http://www.barcodezine.com/The%20Future%20Sound%20Of%20London%20Interview.htm |archive-date=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1995, the album was re-released with expanded artwork and a slightly altered track list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondthought.co.uk/fsol/isdn.htm |title=The Future Sound of London: Welcome to the Galaxial Pharmaceutical |website=Secondthought.co.uk |date=5 December 1994 |access-date=22 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe band's interests have covered different areas including film and video, [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics]], [[animation]] in making almost all their own videos for their singles, radio broadcasting and creating electronic devices for sound making.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">{{cite web|author=Andrea Giacobe/Astralwerks |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/future_sound_of_london/artist.jhtml |title=Future Sound of London &#124; Music Artist &#124; Videos, News, Photos & Ringtones &#124; MTV |website=Mtv.com |access-date=22 March 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yage.co.uk/glitch.html |title=glitch |website=Yage.co.uk |access-date=22 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n===''Dead Cities''===\n{{listen|filename=WipEout 2097 - FSOL_landmass - WipEout 2097.ogg|title=\"Landmass\" (1995)|description=Sample of \"Landmass\", which was featured in the game [[Wipeout 2097|''WipEout 2097'']].|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe 1995 edition of ''John Peel Sessions'' featured new tracks which moved away from [[breakbeat]] and free sampling of ''ISDN''. In 1996, the band released ''[[Dead Cities (album)|Dead Cities]]'' which expanded upon these early demos, in a mix of ambient textures and dance music. The new sound was introduced in the lead single \"[[My Kingdom (song)|My Kingdom]].\" The album featured the first collaboration with composer [[Max Richter]], including on a 1997 [[big beat]] single \"[[We Have Explosive]]\" that featured manipulated samples of [[Run DMC]]. The track was used on popular soundtracks to ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', and the video game ''[[Wipeout 2097|WipE'out\" 2097]]'', the latter also including a new track \"Landmass.\" \"We Have Explosive\" was the band's highest charting single, and over the course of its five-part extended version included hints of [[funk]].\n\nThe album was promoted by what the band described as \"the fuck rock'n'roll tour\" via ISDN, gaining attention as the first world tour without leaving a studio. While the 1994 tour focused on creating soundscapes and unreleased material, the 1996 and 1997 shows were more conventional, each offering a different take on music featured on ''Dead Cities'', blending current with occasional unreleased tracks. The final performances included considerable use of live guitar and percussion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}} These sessions were the basis of the band's later [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] projects of the following decade, while others appeared on the subsequent album series ''From The Archives''.\n\n===New millennium===\nAfter a four-year hiatus, rumours of [[mental illness]] began to spread which turned out to be nothing more than exaggeration of Cobain's [[mercury poisoning]] from fillings in his teeth. Cobain gained much from the experience, realising that music was a tool for psychic exploration and entertainment but also one for healing.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> The pair returned in 2002 with ''\"[[The Isness]]\"'', a record heavily influenced by 1960s and 1970s [[psychedelia]] and released under their alias Amorphous Androgynous. It was preceded by ''[[Papua New Guinea (song)#\"Translations\"|Papua New Guinea Translations]]'', a mini album which contained a mixture of remixes of FSOL's track as well as new material from ''The Isness'' sessions. The album received mixed press due to the drastic change in sound which was inspired by Cobain's and Dougan's (separate) travels to India and immersion in spiritualism, nevertheless the majority was positive with ''[[Muzik]]'' magazine offering the album a 6/5 mark and dubbing it \"...a white beam of light from heaven...\" and other British publications such as ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]]'' praising the album and the band's ability to do something so completely different from what they had done before.<ref>[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Fsol_-_aa_-_divinity_back_cover_with_reviews.jpg ]{{Dead link|date=August 2010|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.secondthought.co.uk/fsol/muzik02.htm |title=The Future Sound of London: Welcome to the Galaxial Pharmaceutical |website=Secondthought.co.uk |access-date=22 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nThree years on, they followed the album with a continuation of the Amorphous Androgynous project, ''[[Alice in Ultraland]]''. Rumoured to be accompanied by a film of the same title, the album took ''The Isness''{{'}} psychedelic experimentation and toned it down, giving the album a singular theme and sound, and replacing the more bizarre moments with [[funk music|funk]] and ambient interludes. The album was ignored by the press, but was received more favourably among fans than its predecessor. Unlike ''The Isness'', which featured almost 100 musicians over the course of it and the various alternative versions and [[remix]] albums, ''Alice in Ultraland'' featured a fairly solid band lineup throughout, which extended to live shows which the band had undertaken away from the ISDN cables from 2005 onwards.\n{{quote|text=...song form has just become too limited. And when I say 'psychedelic', it's not a reference to 60s music but to the basic outlook of a child, which we all have. I think this is the only salvation now. Dance music taught us how to use the studio in a new way, but we have to now take that knowledge and move on with it. This stuff, electronic music, is not dead. It's a process that is ongoing. We have to take hold of the past and go forward with it...|source=Cobain on the new Amorphous Androgynous sound.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />}}\n\n===5.1 & digital experimentation===\nThe FSOL moniker re-appeared in 2006 with a piece entitled \"A Gigantic Globular Burst Of Anti-Static\", intended as an experiment in [[5.1 Surround Sound]] and created for an exhibition at the Kinetica art museum entitled, appropriately, \"Life Forms\". The piece contained reworked material from their archives and newer, more abstract ambient music. The piece was coupled with a video called \"Stereo Sucks\", marking the band's theories on the limitations of stereo music, which was released on a [[DVD]] packaged with issue 182 of ''Future Music Magazine'' in December 2006 and on FSOL's own download site in March 2007.\n\nThey also moved into creating their own sounds when they began constructing electronic instruments, the result of which can be heard on the 2007 release ''[[Hand-Made Devices]]''. At their website Glitch TV (where the motto is \"[A] sudden interruption in sanity, continuity or programme function\") they sell and explain their devices such as the \"Electronic Devices Digital Interface\" glitch equipment.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /><ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/-7J0MkzfcBs Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070321032404/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7J0MkzfcBs Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7J0MkzfcBs&feature=PlayList&p=461CB93226697866&index=4 |title=YouTube - electronic devices digital interface (EdDi) |website=Uk.youtube.com |date=22 June 2006 |access-date=22 March 2009}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===FSOLdigital and the Archives===\nIn 2007, the band uploaded several archive tracks online, for the first time revealing much of their unreleased work and unveiling some of the mystery behind the band. The old FSOL material, including the previously unreleased album ''[[Environments (album)|Environments]]'', along with a selection of newer experiments, the 5.1 experiments and a promise of unreleased Amorphous Androgynous psychedelic material, was uploaded for sale on their online shop, FSOLdigital.com.\n{{quote|text=The FSOLdigital platform has performed very well - we are delighted that people still dig us - we dig you all too.|source=Brian Dougans on the positive reaction to the site and ''\"Archives\"'' sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondthought.co.uk/fsol/ |title=The Future Sound of London: Welcome to the Galaxial Pharmaceutical |website=Secondthought.co.uk |access-date=22 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313152959/http://www.secondthought.co.uk/fsol/ |archive-date=13 March 2012 }}</ref>}}\n\nIn early March 2008, the band released a new online album as Amorphous Androgynous entitled ''[[The Peppermint Tree and Seeds of Superconsciousness]]'', which they describe as \"A collection of psychedelic relics from The Amorphous Androgynous, 1967-2007\". The release retains the sound of their last two psychedelic albums, while expanding on the element of funk first introduced on 2005's ''[[Alice in Ultraland]]''. They recorded their following album, ''[[The Woodlands of Old]]'', under the alias of their imaginary engineer Yage. Unlike the techno work recorded as Yage in 1992, this new record was darker, more [[trip hop]] and [[world music]]-oriented and featured ex-[[Propellerheads]] member Will White.\n\nFrom 2008, the band showcased a series of radio broadcasts and podcasts called The Electric Brain Storms, originally on stations such as [[Proton Radio]], PBS radio in Australia, and Frisky Radio. The remaining shows appeared on the band's official site.<ref name=\"digitalpodroom\"/> and SoundCloud.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/fsol-digital-recordings/the-electric-brain-storm|title=THE ELECTRIC BRAIN STORM - Document Eight|access-date=27 April 2019|website=Soundcloud.com}}</ref> The shows featured electronic, krautrock, experimental and psychedelic favourites of the band mixed in with known and unknown FSOL material, including newly recorded tracks, archived pieces, and new alias recordings. Many of the new tracks appeared on the band's ''Environments'' series. Cobain has described the new music as having \"the introspective, kind of euphoric sadness that was always there in the FSOL melodies\".<ref name=\"secondthought.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.secondthought.co.uk/fsol/newalbum.htm |title=The Future Sound of London: Welcome to the Galaxial Pharmaceutical |website=Secondthought.co.uk |access-date=22 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrom this point, the band have been alternating their focus between different projects. In 2008, ''[[Environments II]]'' and ''[[From the Archives Vol. 5]]'' were released on the band's site, followed by ''[[Environments 3]]'' and ''[[From the Archives Vol. 6]]'' in 2010; and ''[[Environments 4]]'' and ''[[From the Archives Vol. 7]]'' in 2012.
