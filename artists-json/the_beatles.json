They are regarded as the [[Cultural impact of the Beatles|most influential band of all time]]{{sfn|Hasted|2017|p=425}} and were integral to the development of [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] and [[popular music]]'s recognition as an art form.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=125}} Rooted in [[skiffle]], [[beat music|beat]] and 1950s [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]], their sound incorporated elements of [[classical music]] and [[traditional pop]] in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from [[sentimental ballad|ballads]] and [[Music of India|Indian music]] to [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[hard rock]]. As [[Recording practices of the Beatles|pioneers in recording]], songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's [[Baby boomers|youth]] and sociocultural movements.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=157}}\n\nLed by primary songwriters [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, [[the Quarrymen]], and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and [[Hamburg]] over three years from 1960, initially with [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] playing [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including [[Pete Best]], before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager [[Brian Epstein]] moulded them into a professional act, and producer [[George Martin]] guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to [[EMI Records]] and achieving their first hit, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"[[Beatlemania]]\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the [[British Invasion]] of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their concert tours, led to the band's [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|retirement from live performances]] in 1966. At this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969). The success of these records heralded the [[album era]], as albums became the dominant form of record consumption over [[single (music)|single]]s; they also increased public interest in [[psychedelic drug]]s and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in [[electronic music]], album art and [[music video]]s. In 1968, they founded [[Apple Corps]], a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]] in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists and some [[Collaborations between ex-Beatles|partial reunions]] have occurred. Lennon [[Murder of John Lennon|was murdered]] in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music act of all time]], with estimated sales of 600&nbsp;million units worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-news/yeah-yeah-yeah-rare-footage-of-the-beatles-dublin-performance-34420385.html|title=Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

The band received [[List of awards and nominations received by the Beatles|many accolades]], including seven [[Grammy Award]]s, four [[Brit Awards]], an [[Academy Award]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score#1970s|Best Original Song Score]] for the 1970 documentary film ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let It Be]]'') and fifteen [[Ivor Novello Awards]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s lists of [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|the greatest artists in history]].

They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to [[the Quarrymen]] after discovering that another local group were already using the name.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=47\u201352}} Fifteen-year-old [[Paul McCartney]] met Lennon on 6 July 1957, and joined as a [[rhythm guitar]]ist shortly after.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93\u201399}} In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend [[George Harrison]], then fifteen, to watch the band. Harrison auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young. After a month's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), Harrison performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \"[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus,<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=127}}.</ref> and they enlisted him as [[lead guitar]]ist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=13}}\n\nBy January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the [[Liverpool College of Art]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=103}} The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=17}} were playing [[rock and roll]] whenever they could find a drummer.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=742\u2013743}} Lennon's art school friend [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960. He suggested changing the band's name to ''Beatals'', as a tribute to [[Buddy Holly]] and [[the Crickets]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=18}}{{sfn|Gilliland| 1969|loc=show 27, track 4}} They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief [[The Beat Ballad Show Tour|tour of Scotland]] as the backing group for pop singer and fellow [[Liverpudlian]] [[Johnny Gentle]]. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August simply ''the Beatles''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=18\u201322}}\n\n==== Early residencies and UK popularity ====\n\n[[Allan Williams]], the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them [[The Beatles in Hamburg|in Hamburg]]. They auditioned and hired drummer [[Pete Best]] in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, departed Liverpool for Hamburg four days later, contracted to club owner [[Bruno Koschmider]] for what would be a {{frac|3|1|2}}-month residency.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=21\u201325}} Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] writes: \"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the [[Reeperbahn|red-light area]] comes to life&nbsp;... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=22}}\n\nKoschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the [[The Beatles in Hamburg|Indra Club]]. After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the [[Kaiserkeller]] in October.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=23}} When he learned they had been performing at the rival [[Top Ten Club]] in breach of their contract, he gave them one month's termination notice,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=24, 33}} and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=88}} The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=24}} One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=24\u201325}} Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fianc\u00e9e [[Astrid Kirchherr]],{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=25}} who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=222\u2013224}}\n\nDuring the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used [[Phenmetrazine|Preludin]] both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66\u201367}} In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \"[[exi (subculture)|exi]]\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=32}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=76}} Later on, Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany. McCartney took over bass.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=89, 94}} Producer [[Bert Kaempfert]] contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as [[Tony Sheridan]]'s [[backup band|backing band]] on a series of recordings for [[Polydor Records]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 27, track 4}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=249\u2013251}} As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=450}} Credited to \"Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers\", the single \"[[My Bonnie]]\", recorded in June 1961 and released four months later, reached number 32 on the ''[[Musikmarkt]]'' chart.{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=100}}\n\nAfter the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing [[beat music|Merseybeat]] movement. However, they were growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=33}} In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at [[the Cavern Club]], they encountered [[Brian Epstein]], a local record-store owner and music columnist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=84\u201387}} He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence&nbsp;... [a] star quality.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=34\u201335}}\n\n====First EMI recordings====\nEpstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=84\u201388}} Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month early release in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=10}} On their return to Germany in April, a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from a [[intracerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=56}} Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. To secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=612, 629}} After a New Year's Day audition, [[The Beatles' Decca audition|Decca Records rejected the band]], saying, \"Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} However, three months later, producer [[George Martin]] signed the Beatles to [[EMI]]'s [[Parlophone]] label.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=56}}\n\n[[File:Abbey Rd Studios.jpg|thumb|right|Main entrance at [[EMI Studios]] (now Abbey Road Studios, pictured 2007) |alt=A flight of stone steps leads from an asphalt car park up to the main entrance of a white two-story building.

I Love You (Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=59}}\n\nMartin initially selected the Starr version of \"Love Me Do\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=59}} Released in early October, \"Love Me Do\" peaked at number seventeen on the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=59\u201360}} Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme ''[[Granada Reports|People and Places]]''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=81, 355}} After Martin suggested rerecording \"Please Please Me\" at a faster tempo,{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=90}} a studio session in late November yielded that recording,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=62, 84}} of which Martin accurately predicted, \"You've just made your first No. 1.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=875}}\n\nIn December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=62, 86}} By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums \u2013 including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=191}} Lennon and McCartney had established [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|a songwriting partnership]], and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a [[lead vocalist]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=494}} Epstein, to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=128, 133\u2013134}} Lennon recalled him saying, \"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change \u2013 stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ....\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon said of Epstein, \"We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage.

It was supplemented by the four tracks already released on their first two singles. Martin considered recording the LP live at The Cavern Club, but after deciding that the building's acoustics were inadequate, he elected to simulate a \"live\" album with minimal production in \"a single marathon session at Abbey Road\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=147}} After the moderate success of \"Love Me Do\", the single \"Please Please Me\" was released in January 1963, two months ahead of the album.

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including [[folk-rock]], [[country music|country]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], and [[baroque pop]], without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}}}}\n\nIn ''The Beatles as Musicians'', [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed \u2013 as a means to entertain \u2013 a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\"{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=9}}\n\nIan MacDonald describes McCartney as \"a natural melodist \u2013 a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \"vertical\", employing wide, [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]] intervals which express his \"extrovert energy and optimism\". Conversely, Lennon's \"sedentary, ironic personality\" is reflected in a \"horizontal\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=12}} MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \"characterful lines and textural colourings\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=382\u2013383}}\n\n=== Influences ===\nThe Beatles' earliest influences include Elvis Presley, [[Carl Perkins]], [[Little Richard]] and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=140, 660, 856\u2013858, 881}} During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the [[Star-Club]] in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=660}} Of Presley, Lennon said, \"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=881}} Other early influences include Buddy Holly, [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Roy Orbison]]{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=289, 526, 830}} and [[the Everly Brothers]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=111, 123, 131, 133}}\n\nThe Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Who]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beach Boys]], whose 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' amazed and inspired McCartney.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=99, 217, 357, 1195}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=333\u2013335, 359}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=147, 150, 162, 169}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Miles |first=Barry |date=November 1966 |title=A Conversation with Paul McCartney |newspaper=International Times |location=London}}</ref> Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: \"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].\"{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=17}} Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=147, 165, 177}}\n\n=== Genres ===\nOriginating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs|title=Merseybeat \u2013 Significant Albums, Artists and Songs|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=27 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041739/http://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=30\u201332, 100\u2013107}} Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of ''Beatles for Sale'', \"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\",{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=255}} while Gould credits ''Rubber Soul'' as \"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=296}}\n\n[[File:Guitarras de McCartney y Harrison.jpg|upright=.75|thumb|A [[H\u00f6fner 500/1|H\u00f6fner \"violin\" bass guitar]] and [[Gretsch|Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar]], models played by McCartney and Harrison, respectively; the [[Vox AC30]] amplifier behind them is the model the Beatles used during performances in the early 1960s.|alt=Two electric guitars, a light brown violin-shaped bass and a darker brown guitar resting against a Vox amplifier]]\n\nAlthough the 1965 song \"Yesterday\" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements. Gould observes: \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\"{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=278}} They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\", for instance, is \"cast in the {{lang|en-US|mold}} of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clich\u00e9s of musical melodrama\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=402}}\n\nThe band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side \"Rain\", described by [[Martin C. Strong|Martin Strong]] as \"the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record\".{{sfn|Strong|2004|p=108}} Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (recorded before \"Rain\"), \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\" and \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\". The influence of [[Indian classical music]] was evident in Harrison's \"[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]\", \"[[Love You To]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\" \u2013 Gould describes the latter two as attempts \"to replicate the [[raga]] form in miniature\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=406, 462\u2013463}}\n\nInnovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: \"'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody, and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song \u2013 more sophisticated than pop&nbsp;... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song \u2013 classical or vernacular \u2013 that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2008|p=196}} Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: \"the Beatles&nbsp;... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way.\"{{sfn|Benson|2003|p=43}}\n\nAuthor Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: \"Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained ''in parallel'' their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy.\"{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=256}} As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's \"[[Revolution 9]]\" (whose [[musique concr\u00e8te]] approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's [[country music|country]] song \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\", Harrison's [[rock ballad]] \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", and the \"[[Heavy metal music#Origins: late 1960s and early 1970s|proto-metal]] roar\" of McCartney's \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\".<ref name=\"White Album AllMusic\">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=''The Beatles [White Album]'' \u2013 The Beatles |publisher=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |access-date=21 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530202730/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |archive-date=30 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Contribution of George Martin ===\n[[File:Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|right|thumb|alt=The Beatles with George Martin in the studio in the mid-1960s|Martin (second from right) in the studio with the Beatles in the mid-1960s]]\n\n[[George Martin]]'s close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=721}} He applied his classical musical training in various ways, and functioned as \"an informal music teacher\" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=121, 290}} Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of \"Yesterday\" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a \"hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour\", in MacDonald's description.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=158}} Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding \"something [[baroque music|baroque]]\" to a particular recording.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=290}} In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and [[Brass instrument|brass]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=382, 405, 409, 443, 584}}\n\nCollaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, \"while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements, of which \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\" is an outstanding example.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=238}} Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his stabilising influence:\n\n{{blockquote|Compared with Paul's songs, all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality, John's had a psychedelic, almost mystical quality&nbsp;... John's imagery is one of the best things about his work&nbsp;\u2013 'tangerine trees', 'marmalade skies', 'cellophane flowers' ...&nbsp;I always saw him as an aural [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], rather than some drug-ridden record artist. On the other hand, I would be stupid to pretend that drugs didn't figure quite heavily in the Beatles' lives at that time&nbsp;... they knew that I, in my schoolmasterly role, didn't approve&nbsp;... Not only was I not into it myself, I couldn't see the need for it; and there's no doubt that, if I too had been on dope, ''Pepper'' would never have been the album it was.

The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion \u2013 19 or 20% \u2013 and Brian Epstein's \u2013 9 or 10% \u2013 which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=169\u201371, 368\u2013369}}{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=178}} In 1965, the company went public. Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75&nbsp;million. James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5&nbsp;million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000 shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25&nbsp;million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=37\u201338}} At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=42}}\n\nHarrison created [[Harrisongs]] to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included \"[[Taxman]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=45}} The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as \"[[What Goes On (Beatles song)|What Goes On]]\" and \"[[Flying (Beatles instrumental)|Flying]]\", were also Northern Songs copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with [[Apple Corps|Apple Publishing]] while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrison thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" and \"Something\". That year, as well, Starr created [[Startling Music]], which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"[[Octopus's Garden]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=60\u201361}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=351}}\n\nIn March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company [[Associated Television]] (ATV), founded by impresario [[Lew Grade]], without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding.{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=369\u2013372}} The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in [[City of London|the City]].\"{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=372}} By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon\u2013McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973.{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=296}} In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=236}}\n\nIn 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, [[Associated Communications Corporation]] (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=129}} According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to \"separate off\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for \u00a320&nbsp;million, giving the ex-Beatle \"a week or so\" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a \u00a35&nbsp;million bid that was rejected.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=130}} According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs and turned down an offer of \u00a321\u201325&nbsp;million from McCartney and Ono for Northern Songs. In 1982, ACC was acquired in a [[takeover]] by Australian business magnate [[Robert Holmes \u00e0 Court]] for \u00a360&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=130, 139}}\n\nIn 1985, [[Michael Jackson]] purchased ATV for a reported $47.5&nbsp;million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=140, 174, 176}} In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110&nbsp;million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with [[Sony]], creating a new company, [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=198}} In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Christman|first=Ed |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7526542/sony-atv-michael-jackson-publishing-acquisition-completed |title=Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing |magazine=Billboard |date=30 September 2016|access-date=2 June 2020}}</ref>\n\nDespite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33{{frac|3}}% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=195}} Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs \u2013 \"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S. I Love You\" \u2013 were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before they signed with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=192\u2013193}} in 1978,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=13&ti=1,13&SC=Author&SA=Ardmore%20%26%20Beechwood%2C%20Ltd%2E&PID=Upy2LYQ_qgX3JEfWR3-tuPzH0eAB&SEQ=20190215123104&SID=4 |title=Public Catalog |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 May 1978 |website=cocatalog.loc.gov |publisher=U.S. Copyright Office |access-date=15 February 2019 }}</ref> and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney's company MPL Communications.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=536}} On 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in the [[United States district court]] against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon\u2013McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018.
