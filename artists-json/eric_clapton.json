Cream's repertoire varied from hard rock (\"[[I Feel Free]]\") to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (\"[[Spoonful]]\"). ''Disraeli Gears'' contained Clapton's searing guitar lines, Bruce's soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker's powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream's talents secured them as an influential [[power trio]]. Clapton's voice can be heard on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', on the tracks \"[[Are You Hung Up?]]\" and \"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\".\n\nIn 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the US and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their US hit singles include \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" (No. 5, 1968), \"[[White Room]]\" (No. 6, 1968) and \"[[Cross Road Blues|Crossroads]]\" (No. 28, 1969) \u2013 a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Cross Road Blues\". Though Cream were hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise.

(Clapton had met and become close friends with Harrison after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]].)  In 1968, Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrison's \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", from the Beatles' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"). Harrison's debut solo album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' (1968), became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton went largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints, and Harrison was credited as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for his contributions to the song \"Badge\" on ''Goodbye''. The pair often played live together as each other's guest.

When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.\n\nThe album contained the hit love song \"[[Layla]]\", inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton.

A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd \u2013 who was also producing the Allmans \u2013 invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to \"[[Tell the Truth (Derek and the Dominos song)|Tell the Truth]]\" and \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded \"[[Key to the Highway]]\", \"[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]\" (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others) and \"Why Does Love Got to be So Sad?\" In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded \"I Looked Away\", \"[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]\" and \"Keep on Growing\". Allman returned to record \"I Am Yours\", \"[[Anyday (Derek and the Dominos song)|Anyday]]\" and \"It's Too Late\". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\" and the title track. The following day, the final track, \"It's Too Late\", was recorded.<ref>\"[[The Layla Sessions]]\" CD liner notes.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric \"slowhand\" Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Clapton in Barcelona, 1974]]\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of \"Little Wing\" as a tribute. On {{nowrap|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, ''Layla'' received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amid a blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref>\n\nRecording of a second Dominos studio album was underway when a clash of egos took place and Clapton walked out, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{nowrap|29 October}} 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the ''Layla'' sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did\".<ref>Clapton, ''The Autobiography'', 128.</ref> Although Radle remained Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it was not until 2003 that Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again; Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show.

With this band Clapton recorded ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' (1974), an album with an emphasis on more compact songs and fewer guitar solos; the cover version of \"[[I Shot the Sheriff]]\" was Clapton's first number one hit and was important in bringing [[reggae]] and the music of [[Bob Marley]] to a wider audience. The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One in Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood.

Clapton accepted the invitation and teamed up with Jeff Beck to perform a series of duets \u2013 reportedly their first ever billed stage collaboration. Three of the performances were released on the album of the show, and one of the songs appeared in the film. The performances at London's [[Drury Lane theatre]] heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade.

On the flight over, Clapton indulged in a large number of drinks, for fear he would never be able to drink again.

But it did happen. Clapton would go back to the Hazelden Treatment Center in November 1987. He has stayed sober ever since. A few months after his discharge from his first rehab, Clapton began working on his next album, against doctors' orders. Working with Tom Dowd, he produced what he thought as his \"most forced\" album to date, ''[[Money and Cigarettes]]''. Clapton chose the name of the album \"because that's all I saw myself having left\" after his first rehabilitation from alcoholism.<ref>{{cite book|title=Clapton: The Autobiography|url=https://archive.org/details/claptonautobiogr00clap|url-access=registration|first=Eric|last=Clapton|year=2007|isbn=978-0-385-51851-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, he performed on former [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]]' solo album ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'', and participated in the supporting tour.

In 2006, they performed at the Highclere Castle, in aid of the Countryside Alliance, playing two set pieces of \"[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]\" and \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\".

The album's first track, the hit \"[[It's in the Way That You Use It]]\", appeared in the [[Tom Cruise]]\u2013[[Paul Newman]] film ''[[The Color of Money]]''. The songs \"Tearing Us Apart\" (with [[Tina Turner]]) and \"Miss You\" continued Clapton's more angry sound. This rebound kicked off Clapton's two-year period of touring with Collins and their ''August'' collaborators, bassist [[Nathan East]] and keyboard player/songwriter [[Greg Phillinganes]]. While on tour for ''August'', two concert videos were recorded of the four-man band: ''Eric Clapton Live from Montreux'' and ''Eric Clapton and Friends''. Clapton later remade \"After Midnight\" as a single and a promotional track for the [[Michelob]] beer brand, which had also used earlier songs by Collins and [[Steve Winwood]].
