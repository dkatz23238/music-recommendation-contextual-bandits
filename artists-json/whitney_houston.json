Houston enhanced her popularity upon entering the movie industry. Her [[Whitney Houston singles discography|recordings]] and [[Whitney Houston filmography|films]] have generated both great success and controversy. She has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Whitney Houston|numerous accolades]] throughout her career and posthumously, including two [[Emmy Awards]], six [[Grammy Awards]], 16 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], and 28 [[Guinness World Records]], as well as induction into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame|Grammy]], [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame|Rhythm and Blues Music]], and [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock and Roll]] halls of fame.\n\nHouston began singing in church as a child and became a background vocalist while in high school. She was one of the first black women to appear on the cover of ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' after becoming a teen model in 1981. With the guidance of [[Arista Records]] chairman [[Clive Davis]], Houston signed to the label at age 19. Her first two studio albums, ''[[Whitney Houston (album)|Whitney Houston]]'' (1985) and ''[[Whitney (album)|Whitney]]'' (1987), both peaked at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and are among the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]. Houston's third studio album, ''[[I'm Your Baby Tonight]]'' (1990), yielded two ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one singles: \"[[I'm Your Baby Tonight (song)|I'm Your Baby Tonight]]\" and \"[[All the Man That I Need]]\".\n\nHouston made her acting debut with the romantic thriller film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992), which became the [[List of highest-grossing films|tenth highest-grossing film]] to that date despite receiving poor reviews for its screenplay and lead performances. She recorded six songs for [[The Bodyguard (soundtrack)|the film's soundtrack]], including \"[[I Will Always Love You#Whitney Houston version|I Will Always Love You]]\" which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and became the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling physical singles|best-selling physical single]] by a woman in music history. The soundtrack for ''The Bodyguard'' won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] and remains the bestselling soundtrack album of all time. Houston went on to star and record soundtracks for ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Preacher's Wife]]'' (1996). Houston produced the latter's [[The Preacher's Wife (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], which became the bestselling [[Gospel music|gospel]] album of all time. As a film producer, she produced multicultural movies including ''[[Cinderella (1997 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1997) and series including ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'' and ''[[The Cheetah Girls (film)|The Cheetah Girls]].''\n\nHouston's first studio album in eight years, ''[[My Love Is Your Love]]'' (1998), sold millions and spawned several hit singles, including \"[[Heartbreak Hotel (Whitney Houston song)|Heartbreak Hotel]]\", \"[[It's Not Right but It's Okay]]\" and \"[[My Love Is Your Love (song)|My Love Is Your Love]]\".

Her 2002 studio album, ''[[Just Whitney]]'', received mixed reviews. Her drug use and a tumultuous marriage to singer [[Bobby Brown]] received widespread media coverage. After a six-year break from recording, Houston returned to the top of the ''Billboard'' 200 chart with her final studio album, ''[[I Look to You]]'' (2009). On February 11, 2012, Houston accidentally drowned in a bathtub at the [[the Beverly Hilton|Beverly Hilton]] hotel in Beverly Hills, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors.

Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential than they were in the years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houston's voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated.<ref name=\"nytimesjon\" /></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s music critic Andy Gill also wrote about Houston's influence on modern R&B and singing competitions, comparing it to Michael Jackson's. \"Because Whitney, more than any other single artist \u2013 Michael Jackson included \u2013 effectively mapped out the course of modern R&B, setting the bar for standards of soul vocalese and creating the original template for what we now routinely refer to as the 'soul diva' \", stated Gill. \"Jackson was a hugely talented icon, certainly, but he will be as well remembered (probably more so) for his presentational skills, his dazzling dance moves, as for his musical innovations. Whitney, on the other hand, just sang and the ripples from her voice continue to dominate the pop landscape.\" Gill said that there \"are few, if any, Jackson imitators on today's TV talent shows, but every other contestant is a Whitney wannabe, desperately attempting to emulate that wondrous combination of vocal effects&nbsp;\u2013 the flowing melisma, the soaring mezzo-soprano confidence, the tremulous fluttering that carried the ends of lines into realms of higher yearning\".<ref name=\":3\">{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Any|date=February 17, 2012|title=Whitney Houston, the greatest voice of her generation|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/whitney-houston-greatest-voice-her-generation-6988653.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210726184700/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/whitney-houston-greatest-voice-her-generation-6988653.html|archive-date=July 26, 2021|access-date=February 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Steve Huey from Allmusic wrote that the shadow of Houston's prodigious technique still looms large over nearly every pop diva and smooth urban soul singer&nbsp;\u2013 male or female&nbsp;\u2013 in her wake and spawned a legion of imitators.<ref name=\"allmusicbiography\" /> ''Rolling Stone'' stated that Houston \"redefined the image of a female soul icon and inspired singers ranging from Mariah Carey to [[Rihanna]]\".<ref name=\":2\">{{cite magazine|last=Macnie|first=Jim|year=2001|title=Whitney Houston Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/whitney-houston/biography|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=October 16, 2010}}</ref> The magazine placed her 34th on their \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" list.<ref name=\"rollingstonetop100singers\" /> ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' ranked Houston at number five on their list of 50 Most Influential R&B Stars of all time, calling her \"the diva to end all divas\".<ref name=\":10\">{{cite magazine|url = http://photos.essence.com/galleries/50_most_influential_black_musicians#811963 | title = 50 Most Influential RnB Stars | magazine= [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]] | date = June 21, 2011 | access-date = July 1, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628203900/http://photos.essence.com/galleries/50_most_influential_black_musicians#811963 | archive-date = June 28, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Awards and achievements ==\n{{Further|List of awards and nominations received by Whitney Houston|Whitney Houston chart records and achievements}}\n[[File:Whitney Houston wax figure.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Madame Tussauds|Madame Tussaud]] wax figure of Houston]]\nHouston won numerous accolades, including 2 Emmy Awards, 6 Grammy Awards, 2 Grammy Hall of Fame honors, 14 World Music Awards, 16 Billboard Music Awards and 22 American Music Awards.
