The name came from combining the nickname of [[MC5]]'s [[Fred \"Sonic\" Smith]] with [[reggae]] artist [[Big Youth]].{{sfn|Browne|2008|p=46}} Gordon later recalled that \"as soon as Thurston came up with the name Sonic Youth, a certain sound that was more of what we wanted to do came about.\"{{sfn|Azerrad|2001|p=236}} The band played [[Noise Fest]] in June 1981 at New York's [[White Columns]] gallery,{{sfn|Browne|2008|p=50-53}} where [[Lee Ranaldo]] was playing as a member of [[Glenn Branca]]'s electric guitar ensemble. Their performance impressed Moore, who described them as \"the most ferocious guitar band that I had ever seen in my life\",{{sfn|Azerrad|2001|p=234}} and he invited Ranaldo to join Sonic Youth.{{sfn|Browne|2008|p=66-67}} The new trio played three songs at the festival later in the week without a drummer.

In December 1981 the group recorded five songs at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]]. The material was released as the EP ''[[Sonic Youth (EP)|Sonic Youth]]'' which'','' while largely ignored, was sent to a few key members of the American music press, who gave it uniformly favorable reviews.{{sfn|Azerrad|2001|p=237}} The album featured a relatively conventional post-punk style, in contrast to their later releases.

The group asked Bert to rejoin, and he agreed on the condition that he would not be fired again after the tour's conclusion.{{sfn|Azerrad|2001|p=245}} Bert went on to play on the band's ''[[Kill Yr Idols]]'' EP later in 1983.\n\nSonic Youth were well received in Europe, but the New York press largely ignored the local [[noise rock]] scene. Eventually, as the press began to take notice of the genre, Sonic Youth was grouped with bands like [[Big Black]], the [[Butthole Surfers]], and [[Pussy Galore (band)|Pussy Galore]] under the \"pigfucker\" label by ''[[Village Voice]]'' editor [[Robert Christgau]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=March 3, 1987 |author-link=Robert Christgau |title=Township Jive Conquers the World: The 13th (or 14th) Annual Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |newspaper=[[Village Voice]]}}</ref> Another critic from ''The Village Voice'' panned a substandard September concert in New York.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} Gordon wrote a scornful letter to the newspaper, criticizing it for not supporting its local music scene, to which Christgau responded that the paper was not obligated to support them. Moore retaliated by renaming the song \"[[Kill Yr Idols]]\" to \"I Killed Christgau with My Big Fucking Dick\", before the two eventually sorted out their differences amicably.{{sfn|Azerrad|2001|p=246}}\n\nDuring another tour of Europe in 1984, Sonic Youth's disastrous London debut (where the band's equipment malfunctioned and Moore destroyed it onstage in frustration) actually resulted in rave reviews in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' and the ''[[NME]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} When they returned to New York they were so popular that they were able to book local gigs regularly.{{sfn|Azerrad|2001|p=248}} That same year, Moore and Gordon were married, and Sonic Youth released ''[[Bad Moon Rising (album)|Bad Moon Rising]]'', a self-described \"[[Americana (music)|Americana]]\" album that served as a reaction to the state of the nation at the time.{{sfn|Azerrad|2001|p=250}} The album, recorded by [[Martin Bisi]], was built around transitional pieces that Moore and Ranaldo had come up with in order to take up time onstage during tuning breaks;{{sfn|Azerrad|2001|p=248}} as a result, there are almost no gaps between the songs on the records.
