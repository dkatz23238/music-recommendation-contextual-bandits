Faced with disappointment, the group changed direction from their [[science fiction]] themes and produced a more conceptual emotion-based third album in 1984 called ''[[The Story of a Young Heart]]'', with \"[[The More You Live, the More You Love]]\" as the lead single. Despite heavy rotation on [[MTV]] and other music video shows at that time, the single was only moderately successful, and the album's other two singles \u2013 \"Never Again (The Dancer)\" and \"Remember David\" (released only in a few European countries) \u2013 did not make any headway. Faced with sliding sales and a loss of direction, the band continued to consider their options whilst touring. During this period, Paul Reynolds left the band, and was replaced by Gary Steadman (from [[Classix Nouveaux]]).<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Keyboardist Chris Chryssaphis was added at the same time to augment their sound.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Both stayed in the band for the recording and release of next the album\u2013''[[Dream Come True (A Flock of Seagulls album)|Dream Come True\u2013]]''but departed once the tour had ended.

Mazzetti (drums) and Dean Pichette (bass guitar). They recorded the album ''[[The Light at the End of the World (A Flock of Seagulls album)|The Light at the End of the World]]'' in 1994, but it failed to chart. Drummer John Walker later replaced Mazzetti.\n\nIn 1998, Berner, Walker, and Pichette departed the band and were replaced by Joe Rodriguez, Darryl Sons, and Rob Wright, respectively. In 1999, the band re-recorded the [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] song \"[[This Used to Be My Playground]]\" for the 2000 Madonna tribute album ''The World's Greatest 80s Tribute to Madonna''. In November 2003, the original lineup of Mike and Ali Score, Paul Reynolds and Frank Maudsley reunited for a one-off performance on the VH1 series ''[[Bands Reunited]]''. In September 2004, they reformed again and did a brief tour in the United States. Though the tour continued to be advertised as the \"original lineup\", later shows no longer included the original band, but was Mike Score's continuation of the newer band; which by this point consisted of Score, Rodriguez, and new recruits Michael Brahm (drums), and Pando (bass guitar). In 2005, this version of the group starred in the American version of the entertainment show ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me Baby, One More Time]]'', where they performed \"I Ran\" and a cover of [[Ryan Cabrera]]'s song, \"[[On the Way Down|On The Way Down]]\" for a chance to have $20,000 donated to a charity of their choice.\n\nIn June 2011, Frank Maudsley and Paul Reynolds performed at [[Croxteth Hall|Croxteth Park]] music festival in Liverpool, under the name 'A Flock of Seagulls'.<ref>{{cite web|title= 80's Band A Flock of Seagulls top Croxteth Free Music Festival lineup |website= LLTV |date= 25 June 2011 |access-date= 22 August 2019 |url= http://liverpool-live.tv/uncategorized/80s-band-a-flock-of-seagulls-top-croxteth-free-music-festival-lineup/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Jade |last= Wright |title= Jade Wright recommends . . .Croxteth Park Free Music Festival |newspaper= [[Liverpool Echo]] |date= 10 June 2011 |access-date= 22 August 2019 |url= https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/music/jade-wright-recommends---3372111}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 February 2013, Mike Score indicated via his YouTube account that he was pursuing his solo career.
