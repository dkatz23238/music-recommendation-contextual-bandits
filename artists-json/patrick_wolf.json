During the recording of ''[[Lycanthropy (album)|Lycanthropy]]'', Wolf studied composition at [[Trinity College of Music]] for one year. ''Lycanthropy'' was released in the summer of 2003. He also made some guest appearances as a viola player with [[Chicks on Speed]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Owen Pallett]], [[CocoRosie]], and [[The Hidden Cameras]]. The Germany-based [[Tomlab]] later released the album in America and Europe. His second album of 2005, ''[[Wind In The Wires]]'', which was inspired by Patrick's Cornish and Irish roots, was released on the same label and likewise met with critical acclaim. The single ''Tristan'', based on the Cornish legend, Tristram of Lyonesse, received significant attention from critics and remains a fan favourite.\n\n===''The Magic Position''===\nFollowing the success of ''Wind in the Wires'', Wolf signed a record deal with [[Loog Records|Loog]] in 2005 and began recording his third album, ''[[The Magic Position]]'', which featured collaborations with [[Marianne Faithfull]] and [[Edward Larrikin]] of [[Larrikin Love]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-tNpyogrSw |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/K-tNpyogrSw |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live| title=Patrick Wolf vodcast| website=[[YouTube]]| access-date=5 February 2007}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Its official release on 26 February met with critical acclaim, and gained a degree of commercial success due to the relative accessibility compared to his previous works.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} ''The Magic Position'' was released in the United States on Low Altitude Records on 1 May 2007.<ref>[http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=110&csid2=4&fid1=25097 'The Amorphous Patrick Wolf'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120234547/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=110&csid2=4&fid1=25097 |date=20 November 2007 }} Exclaim.ca</ref> A concept album on the theme of love, the majority of the album was written after the end of a long term intimate relationship. In January 2007, the first of six [[Video podcast|vodcast]]s was made available on [[iTunes]]. The series included live performances of old and new material and interviews. Wolf promoted the album with a concert tour in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia, culminating in two sold out nights at London's [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]]. Both of these shows, which were shot and directed by photographer Brantley Gutierrez, are in development to be shown on a Virgin channel and then released on DVD.\n\n===''The Bachelor'' and ''Lupercalia''===\nWolf began work on his next album, initially titled ''Battle'', immediately after ''The Magic Position'' tour ended. The album was originally conceived as a political album. The focus then shifted to the depression experienced by Wolf during the tour. However, before entering the studio, he fell in love, changing the direction of the album again, and eventually providing enough material for two releases. Wolf parted ways with Universal Records, and on 10 December 2008 announced to ''NME'' his plan to sell \u00a310 shares of the album on bandstocks.com: \"Basically, you can invest in the finishing of the album and the production of it, and you get a share in the album.

Of the song, Wolf said: \"'Time of My Life' is a song that I began writing at the end of a relationship in 2006 and then finished three years later during a temporary break-up in my current relationship. The new album has a direct narrative about love and optimism surviving through adversity and recession.
