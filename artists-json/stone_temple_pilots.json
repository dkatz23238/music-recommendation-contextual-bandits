They began discussing their girlfriends, only to realize they were dating the same woman. However, instead of letting this come between them, they developed a bond and formed a band after they each subsequently broke it off with the girl. Weiland presented a different version of meeting Robert in his [[autobiography]], stating that Weiland and his friends in their band Soi Disant, guitarist Corey Hicock and drummer David Allin, pursued Robert after witnessing him play live at various gigs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}\n \nHowever, after a few years, Allin left to pursue other interests. The remaining members witnessed drummer [[Eric Kretz]] play in a Long Beach club and convinced him to join the band.

The band continued to diverge into various genres and influences; for example, songs like \"And So I Know\" on ''Tiny Music...'' have a distinct [[bossa nova]] sound. Regarding the evolution of the band's sound, Weiland commented that \"the transformation from ''Core'' to where we ended up before we took that time off, when I started with Velvet Revolver, was enormous.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Greg Prato |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/scott-weiland-expects-a-busy-2013-20121121 |title=Scott Weiland Expects a Busy 2013 &#124; Music News |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 21, 2012 |access-date=March 3, 2013 |archive-date=February 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202111648/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/scott-weiland-expects-a-busy-2013-20121121 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWeiland was the band's primary lyricist. His style changed with the band's evolution; much of the lyrics on ''Core'' were written about societal issues such as [[religion]], abuse of power, and isolation. The band's breakthrough single \"[[Sex Type Thing]]\" polarized critics with its lyrics, some interpreting it as advocacy of [[date rape]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belowempty.com/articles.php?s=story&id=9|title=Hard To The Core|date=August 1, 1993|website=Belowempty.com|access-date=April 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102151419/http://www.belowempty.com/articles.php?s=story&id=9|archive-date=January 2, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Weiland intended it as a [[feminism|feminist]] anthem, with its lyrics written in mockery of the narrator. As Weiland began to deal with substance abuse, his lyrics became more personal and intricate; songs like \"Interstate Love Song\" deal with his addiction's tolls on his relationship with his then-wife, Janina. The lyrics of the band's fourth album were written to provide closure to his marriage and addiction to [[heroin]]. \n\nFollowing the band's reunion in 2008, Weiland once again evolved as a songwriter, explaining: \"[In] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so a lot of the stuff was just from my point of view. Now, I tend to look at some of the greats like [[Leonard Cohen]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. I look at their storytelling [and] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day.\"\n\n==Legacy==\n''Core,'' certified 8\u00d7 platinum by the [[RIAA]], drove the band to popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Stone%20Temple%20Pilots&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1991&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=Gold and Platinum |publisher=[[RIAA]] |access-date=January 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904084251/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Stone%20Temple%20Pilots&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1991&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |archive-date=September 4, 2015  }}</ref> STP went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling 40 million records worldwide,<ref name=\"mtvlegacy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585012/20080408/stone_temple_pilots.jhtml |title=Stone Temple Pilots Reunite To Continue 'Legacy,' Thanks To Scott Weiland's Wife |author=Harris, Chris |date=April 8, 2008 |website=MTV.com |access-date=January 25, 2010}}</ref> including 17.5 million units in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&table=tblTopArt&action= |title=Top Selling Artists |publisher=[[RIAA]] |access-date=January 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725020825/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&table=tblTopArt&action= |archive-date=July 25, 2013  }}</ref> before their dissolution in 2003.

In retrospect, [[MTV]] writer James Montgomery published an article questioning the validity of music critics' opinions of the band during the 90s, saying, \"All I'm suggesting is that perhaps it's time to admit that we were wrong about them from the get-go\u2014that we treated them unfairly.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Montgomery |first=James|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/xj84nd/stone-temple-pilots-werent-nirvana-but-they-were-close-in-bigger-than-the-sound|title=Stone Temple Pilots Weren't Nirvana \u2013 But They Were Close, In Bigger Than The Sound|publisher=MTV |date=April 9, 2008|access-date=October 10, 2022}}</ref> In a review of the band's 2003 greatest hits collection ''[[Thank You (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Thank You]],'' [[AllMusic]] critic Stephen Erlewine wrote that \"STP made music that sounded great at the time and even better now\", and that \"this music has stood the test of time\", calling ''Thank You'' \"nearly perfect\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/thank-you-r665994/review |title=Thank You \u2013 Stone Temple Pilots |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=April 26, 2012}}</ref> Erlewine also wrote that \"STP was the best straight-ahead rock singles outfit of their time.\"<ref name=\"AMPurple\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Scott Weiland, [[Smashing Pumpkins]] singer [[Billy Corgan]] paid official tribute to the band and musician, calling him one of the greatest voices of their generation:\n<blockquote><poem>\"It was, I'd guess you'd say, my way of apology for having been so critical of STP when they appeared on the scene like some crazy, man-fueled rocket. And not only was the knight up front freshly handsome to a fault, but he could sing too! As any supreme actor gives a real and different voice to each character played. It was STP's [[Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop|3rd album]] that had got me hooked, a wizardly mix of glam and post-punk, and I confessed to Scott, as well as the band many times, how wrong I'd been in assessing their native brilliance. And like Bowie can and does, it was Scott's phrasing that pushed his music into a unique, and hard to pin down, aesthetic sonicsphere. Lastly, I'd like to share a thought which though clumsy, I hope would please Scott In Hominum. And that is if you asked me who I truly believed were the great voices of our generation, I'd say it were he, [[Layne Staley|Layne]], and [[Kurt Cobain|Kurt]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smashingpumpkinsnexus.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107030731/http://www.smashingpumpkinsnexus.com/|url-status=dead|title=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|archive-date=January 7, 2015|website=The Official Smashing Pumpkins}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nOn December 3, 2016, STP posted a tribute on their website to mark the one year anniversary of Weiland's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://stonetemplepilots.com/december-3/|title=- Stone Temple Pilots|newspaper=Stone Temple Pilotsaccess-date=2016-12-03|access-date=December 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205160334/http://stonetemplepilots.com/december-3/|archive-date=December 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2017, Metal Injection ranked Stone Temple Pilots at number 9 on their list of \"10 Heaviest Grunge Bands\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/lists/10-heaviest-grunge-bands |title=10 Heaviest Grunge Bands |work=Metal Injection |access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* [[Dean DeLeo]] \u2013 guitars <small>(1989\u20132003, 2008\u2013present) </small>\n* [[Robert DeLeo]] \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(1989\u20132003, 2008\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Eric Kretz]] \u2013 drums <small>(1989\u20132003, 2008\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Jeff Gutt]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(2017\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* [[Scott Weiland]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(1989\u20132003; 2008\u20132013; died 2015)</small>\n* [[Chester Bennington]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(2013\u20132015; died 2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{awards table}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[MTV Video Music Awards|1993]]\n|\"[[Plush (song)|Plush]]\"\n|[[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[MTV Video Music Awards|1993]]\n|\"Plush\"\n|[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video]]\n|{{nominated}}<ref name=\"awardsandshows.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/mtv-vmas-1995-488.html |title=MTV VMAs 1995 -
