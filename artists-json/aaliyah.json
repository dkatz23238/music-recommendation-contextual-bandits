At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with [[Jive Records]] and her uncle [[Barry Hankerson]]'s [[Blackground Records]]. Hankerson introduced her to [[R. Kelly]], who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). After allegations of an [[illegal marriage]] with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with [[Atlantic Records]].\n\nAaliyah worked with record producers [[Timbaland]] and [[Missy Elliott]] for her second album, ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'', which sold three million copies in the United States and more than eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, ''[[Romeo Must Die]]''. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single \"[[Try Again (Aaliyah song)|Try Again]]\". The song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] solely on [[airplay]], making Aaliyah the first artist in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' history to achieve this goal. After completing ''Romeo Must Die'', Aaliyah filmed her role in ''[[Queen of the Damned]]'', and released, in 2001, her [[Aaliyah (album)|self-titled third and final studio album]], which topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nOn August 25, 2001, Aaliyah died at the age of 22 in [[2001 Marsh Harbour Cessna 402 crash|an airplane accident in the Bahamas]], when the overloaded aircraft she was traveling in crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all nine on board. The pilot was later found to have traces of [[cocaine]] and alcohol in his body and was not qualified to fly the aircraft designated for the flight. Aaliyah's family later filed a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit against the aircraft's operator, [[Blackhawk International Airways]], which was settled out of court. In the decades since her death, Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success, aided by several posthumous releases. She has sold 8.1 million albums in the US and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. ''Billboard'' lists her as the tenth most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years, and the 27th most successful in history.

She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, but she did not stay focused on them. \"You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me.\" Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had \"learned to accept and love\" herself and added: \"...&nbsp;the most important thing is to think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will\".<ref name=Sutherland2/>\n\nDuring her audition for acceptance to the [[Detroit School of Arts|Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts]], Aaliyah sang the song \"[[Ave Maria (Schubert)|Ave Maria]]\" in its entirety in the [[Italian language]].<ref name=Vibe2001CoverStory /> Aaliyah, who maintained a perfect 4.0 grade-point average when graduating from high school, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: \"I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important to have something to fall back on.\" She did this in her own life, as she planned to \"fall back on\" another part of the entertainment industry. She believed that she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, \"when you pick a career it has to be something you love\".<ref name=Sutherland2 />\n\n==Career==\n===1991\u20131995: ''Age Ain't Nothing but a Number''===\n[[File:Ballasyrkellypic.jpg|thumb|left|R.
