Autumn and spring are warm, but short. Winter is mild and rainy. Summer is prolonged, hot and muggy. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\n\nThe average annual rainfall is {{convert|825|mm|in}}, with the large majority of it falling from October to April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. [[Hail]] (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\n{{Weather box \n|width = auto\n|location = [[Beirut International Airport]]\n|metric first = Yes \n|single

issues===\n{{main|Marine environmental issues in Lebanon}}\n\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally used for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"[[2015\u201316 Lebanese protests|You Stink]]\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government finally came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public gardens (sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact, concrete roofs cover 80% of the capital area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/24/middleeast/lebanon-garbage-crisis-river/index.html|title=Lebanon: River of trash chokes Beirut suburb|last1=Hume|first1=Tim|last2=Tawfeeq|first2=Mohammed|work=CNN|access-date=14 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Quarters and sectors===\n{{main|List of places in Beirut}}\n[[File:Beirut Districts.png|thumb|Map of the 12 quarters of Beirut]]\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters ({{lang|fr|quartiers}}):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beirut.gov.lb/www.beirut.gov.lb/MCMSAR/\u062d\u0636\u0627\u0631\u0629%2B\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a/|title=Beirut's official website|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521100928/http://www.beirut.gov.lb/www.beirut.gov.lb/MCMSAR/%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9%2B%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AA/|archive-date=21 May 2008|access-date=23 April 2008}}</ref>\n* [[Achrafieh]]\n* Dar Mreisse \n* Bachoura\n* Mazraa (with the neighbourhood [[Badaro]])\n* Medawar (with the neighbourhood [[Mar Mikha\u00ebl]])\n* Minet El Hosn\n* Moussaitbeh (with [[Ramlet al-Baida]])\n* [[Port of Beirut|Port]]\n* [[Ras Beirut]]\n* Remeil\n* [[Saifi (quarter of Beirut)|Saifi]]\n* Zuqaq al-Blat\n\nThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors ({{lang|fr|secteurs}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beirut.gov.lb/www.beirut.gov.lb/MCMSEN/Maps+of+Beirut/|title=Beirut's Official Website|publisher=Beirut.gov.lb|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412231917/http://www.beirut.gov.lb/www.beirut.gov.lb/MCMSEN/Maps%2Bof%2BBeirut/|archive-date=12 April 2009|access-date=5 May 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Badaro nightlife.jpeg|thumb|Nightlife scene in [[Badaro]]]]\n[[Badaro]] is an edgy, bohemian style neighborhood,{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} within the green district of Beirut ({{lang|fr|secteur du parc}}) which also include the [[Beirut Hippodrome]] and the [[Horsh Beirut|Beirut Pine Forest]] and the French ambassador's [[Pine Residence]].
