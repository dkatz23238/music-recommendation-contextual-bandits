After his island becomes occupied by [[Prospero]] and his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]], Caliban is forced into slavery.<ref>A Vaughan, ''Shakespeare's Caliban'' (Cambridge 1991) p. 9</ref> While he is referred to as a [[Mooncalf|calvaluna or mooncalf]], a freckled monster, he is the only human inhabitant of the island that is otherwise \"not honour'd with a human shape\" (Prospero, I.2.283).<ref>A Vaughan, ''Shakespeare's Caliban'' (Cambridge 1991) p. 10</ref> In some traditions, he is depicted as a wild man, or a deformed man, or a beast man, or sometimes a mix of fish and man, a dwarf or even a tortoise.<ref>A Vaughan, ''Shakespeare's Caliban'' (Cambridge 1991) p. 13-14</ref>\n\nBanished from [[Algiers]], Sycorax was left on the isle, pregnant with Caliban, and died before Prospero's arrival. Caliban, despite his inhuman nature, clearly loved and worshipped his mother, referring to [[Setebos (Shakespeare)|Setebos]] as his mother's god, and appealing to her powers against Prospero.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=P. |editor-last=Hulme |title=The Tempest and its Travels |location=London |year=2000 |page=100}}</ref> Prospero explains his harsh treatment of Caliban by claiming that after initially befriending him, Caliban attempted to rape Miranda. Caliban confirms this gleefully, saying that if he had not been stopped, he would have peopled the island with a race of Calibans<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=P. |editor-last=Hulme |title=The Tempest and its Travels |location=London |year=2000 |pages=231\u2013232}}</ref> \u2013 \"Thou didst prevent me, I had peopled else this isle with Calibans\" (Act I:ii). Prospero then entraps Caliban and torments him with harmful magic if Caliban does not obey his orders. Resentful of Prospero, Caliban takes [[Stephano (The Tempest)|Stephano]], one of the shipwrecked servants, as a god and as his new master. Caliban learns that Stephano is neither a god nor Prospero's equal in the conclusion of the play, however, and Caliban agrees to obey Prospero again.\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nBe not afeard; the isle is full of noises\nSounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.\nSometimes a thousand twangling instruments\nWill hum about mine ears; and sometime voices\nThat, if I then had waked after long sleep,\nWill make me sleep again; and then in dreaming,\nThe clouds me thought would open, and show riches\nReady to drop upon me, that when I waked\nI cried to dream again.\n</poem>\n</blockquote>\n\n== Name ==\n[[File:Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban dancing.jpg|thumb|Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo dancing]]\nThere is a long history of enthusiastic speculation on the name's origin or derivation.\n\nOne of the most prominent suggestions concerns Caliban being an [[anagram]] of the Spanish word {{Lang|es|can\u00edbal}} ([[Island Caribs|Carib people]]), the source of ''[[cannibalism|cannibal]]'' in English.

The monster later turns out to be born of the subconscious of the film's Prospero character, Dr.&nbsp;Morbius, using the advanced technology of the Krell. Like Caliban, the monster ultimately rebels and attempts to kill its master. Captain Adams confronts Dr.&nbsp;Morbius with the fact that he is giving form to his subconscious, and his guilty conscience, from having brought it into existence, finally ends the monster's destructive rampage.\n\nIn [[John Fowles]]'s 1963 novel ''[[The Collector]]'', Miranda refers to her kidnapper as Caliban.\n\nIn [[J. G. Ballard]]'s 1965 novel ''[[The Drought]]'', Lomax refers to Quilter as his Caliban.\n\nIn the 1965 movie ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', during the scene where Victor Komarovsky convinces Zhivago to allow him to rescue Lara by taking her to Vladivostok, Komarovsky refers to himself as a Caliban: \"Do you accept the protection of this ignoble Caliban on any terms that Caliban cares to make?\"\n\nCaliban was the central character in James Clouser's rock ballet ''Caliban'', a 90-minute adaptation of ''The Tempest'' that was scored with live performances by [[St. Elmo's Fire (band)|St. Elmo's Fire]].

He is an albino mutant who lives underground with the Morlocks.<ref>[https://www.marvel.com/characters/caliban/in-comics Caliban: Marvel comics]</ref>\n\nIn the Swedish 1989 film ''[[The Journey to Melonia]]'', an animated film loosely inspired by ''The Tempest'', there is a character named Caliban, a creature whose face consists of mainly vegetables. Unlike Caliban in ''The Tempest'', this Caliban is kind at heart, and even becomes a hero later in the film.\n\nCaliban is the central character in two works of fiction that act as both re-tellings of and sequels to ''The Tempest'': ''Caliban's Hour'' by [[Tad Williams]] ([[HarperCollins]], 1994, {{ISBN|978-0061054136}}) and ''Rough Magic'' by [[Caryl Cude Mullin]] (Second City Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1897187630}}). In both works, Caliban is a more noble character and presented more as Prospero's victim rather than the villain in Shakespeare's play.\n\nCaliban is a supporting character in [[Grace Tiffany]]'s novel ''Ariel'' (HarperCollins, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0060753276}}), another re-telling of ''The Tempest''; rather than having a monstrous shape, he grows up to be a handsome teenager, with his only deformity being a twisted left leg, and it is Ariel's cruel illusions and deceptions that make Prospero see him as a monster.\n\nCaliban is featured as an antagonist in [[Dan Simmons]]' ''[[Ilium/Olympos]]'' duology (2003, 2005).\n\n[[Rob Thurman]]'s [[Cal Leandros series|''Cal Leandros'' series]] (first published 2006) centres around Caliban \"Cal\" Leandros, a half-human, half-Auphe (a nightmarish monster) hybrid who kills monsters for fun and cash in NYC with his human brother and their sleazy cohort, car-salesman Robin Goodfellow. This Cal struggles for control every day against his monster half, dealing with sarcasm and dark humor.\n\n''[[Caliban's War]]'' is the title of the second novel of [[The Expanse (novel series)|''The Expanse'' series]], a space opera by [[James S. A. Corey]].\n\nThe [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] (directed by [[Danny Boyle]]) titled ''Isles of Wonder'' (a name inspired by ''The Tempest'') was heavily influenced by ''The Tempest''. The musical piece played during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony#Lighting the Flame (00:24\u201300:38)|torch lighting ceremony]] was entitled \"[[Caliban's Dream]]\", and Caliban's monologue from Act 3, Scene ii was quoted by [[Kenneth Branagh]] in character as [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] at the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] set piece. \"[[And I Will Kiss]]\", the title of another specially commissioned track from the ceremony, is also a quote from ''The Tempest'' (2:2:148-149). These two songs also appeared on the ceremony's [[Isles of Wonder (album)|official soundtrack]]. The [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]] also featured a recitation of the same monologue, this time by [[Timothy Spall]] playing [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nIn the preface of ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', [[Oscar Wilde]] muses: \"The nineteenth century dislike of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.  The nineteenth century dislike of [[Romanticism]] is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.\"\n\nIn ''[[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina]]'', Caliban is a prince of Hell competing for Sabrina's throne, portrayed by [[Sam Corlett]].\n\nIn the setting of the tabletop game ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'', Caliban is the name of a planet full of grand forests prowled by man-eating monsters. It is the homeworld of Lion El'Jonson, a wild child who is found and civilized by a knight named Luther, and is later revealed to be the Primarch of the Dark Angels Space Marine Chapter. Several hundred years later, Caliban is destroyed in a battle between Lion and Luther.\n\nIn the book ''[[Ilium (novel)|Ilium]]'', Caliban is a destructive, powerful humanlike entity who vacillates who he serves; at one point he served Prospero (the noosphere's personification), later works only for himself, but also sometimes aligned with the malevolent destroyer of worlds Setebos.\n\nIn the videogame [[Destiny 2]], ''Caliban's Hand'' is an exotic armor related to solar energy, added the 23rd of May 2022.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3|Arielismo]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2|}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat}}\n* ''[http://allpoetry.com/Caliban-at-Sunset- Caliban at Sunset]'', a poem by P.
