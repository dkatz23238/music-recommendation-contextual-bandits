Raised by two Jamaican parents, Smith embraced his heritage in his music and image as an artist. Smith was the only member of the group to wear dreads and use Jamaican slang, or patois, in his raps. Smith's unique style added an element to the group that allowed for rapid success.

After Busta signed to [[J Records]], a label started by the then recently ousted [[Arista Records]] chief and founder [[Clive Davis]], he released a greatest hits collection ''[[Total Devastation: The Best of Busta Rhymes]]'', alongside a new album of original work. Continuing the [[Bible|Biblical]] theme of his previous albums, he titled his record ''[[Genesis (Busta Rhymes album)|Genesis]]''. The album featured collaborations with [[Mary J. Blige]], [[P. Diddy]], [[Kelis]], and others. Genesis was powered by the hit single with Kelis, \"What It Is\", and his solo single released in November 2001, \"[[Break Ya Neck]]\". The final single was the summer smash \"[[Pass the Courvoisier, Part II]]\", which featured [[Pharrell]] and P. Diddy. Despite the success of the two singles, this album did not sell as well as previous releases. Fellow Flipmode members were featured, but minor changes in the roster were noted.\n\nIn 2002, Busta Rhymes released his sixth studio album ''[[It Ain't Safe No More]]''.

The song \"[[World Go Round]]\", featuring British singer [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], was released in France on April 6, 2009 due to the heavy rotation of a leaked version.

''Back on My B.S.'' was released internationally, but because of one song, \"[[Arab Money]]\", it cannot be purchased as a CD there, although the album can still be purchased via [[iTunes]]. According to the National Media Council, the lyrics were considered to be offensive to Arabs and to Islam, because it quoted the [[Shahada]].\n\nIn November 2008, when \"Arab Money\" was released as a single, DJ Dany Neville and the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] rapper The Narcicyst responded by recording a reply. Rhymes later apologized.
