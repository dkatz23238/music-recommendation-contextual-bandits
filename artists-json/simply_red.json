By early 1985, Hucknall and Rashman had assembled a band of local session musicians and begun to attract record-company attention. The group first went under a number of names like \"World Service\", \"Red And The Dancing Dead\", \"Just Red\" (after Hucknall's nickname \"Red\", denoting his hair colour) but then Hucknall decided it would sound better with the addition of the word 'Simply'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplyred.com/faq/|title=Simply Red &#124; Mick Hucknall FAQ|website=Simplyred.com|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref> The band's name is also linked to Hucknall's allegiance to being a supporter of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], as the club's home shirt colour is [[red]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/louisebruton/20-fun-facts-about-simply-red-and-mick-hucknall-f5b5 |title=20 Fun Facts About Simply Red And Mick Hucknall |website=Buzzfeed.com |date=20 March 2015 |access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe initial Simply Red line-up consisted of Mick Hucknall (vocals), David Fryman (guitar), [[Tony Bowers]] (bass), [[Fritz McIntyre]] (keyboards and vocals), [[Tim Kellett]] (brass and live backing vocals) and [[Chris Joyce]] (drums).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Bowers and Joyce had both previously been members of [[post-punk]] bands [[The Durutti Column]] and [[The Mothmen]]; Kellett had also been a member of The Durutti Column, though not at the same time as Bowers and Joyce.\n\nSimply Red signed a contract with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] in 1985,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> but after recording one track (\"Red Box\"), Fryman left the group and was replaced by guitarist [[Sylvan Richardson]], who was billed only as 'Sylvan'.\n\n\"Red Box\" would eventually see release in 1985 as a B-side to the group's first single, \"[[Money's Too Tight (to Mention)]]\", a cover of a soul song originally recorded by [[The Valentine Brothers]]. \"Money's Too Tight (to Mention)\" gained international success, reaching the UK and [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] Top 20,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> then later the American, French and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Top 30, and the Italian Top 5. It was included on their debut album, ''[[Picture Book (Simply Red album)|Picture Book]]'', also released in 1985.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nSeveral low-charting singles would follow for the band. Among the comparative flops was a re-recording of the Frantic Elevators' \"[[Holding Back the Years]]\", done up in a new soul-ballad style arrangement.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Released as Simply Red's third single in 1985, the track initially placed outside the UK Top 50. However, upon being re-released in 1986, \"Holding Back the Years\" became a major hit, peaking at #1 in Ireland, #2 in the UK, #3 in the Netherlands, #20 in Italy and later #1 in the United States.\n\nSimply Red's second album, 1987's ''[[Men and Women (album)|Men and Women]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> saw the band adopting bowler hats and colourful suits instead of their earlier ragamuffin look. As well, the introspection and social commentary of their debut album was replaced by a [[blue-eyed soul]] sound with funk influences. Veteran [[Motown]] songwriter [[Lamont Dozier]] co-authored two tracks with Hucknall for the album\u2014these tracks were credited to 'Hucknall/Dozier/Hucknall' in the original album credits, in homage to the famous Motown writing team of [[Holland/Dozier/Holland]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nThe album's lead single \"[[The Right Thing (song)|The Right Thing]]\" was another international hit,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> charting in the top 40 throughout Europe and North America.  Several follow-up singles also met with modest success in the UK and elsewhere.\n\n===1989\u20131995: Peak years===\nGuitarist Richardson left after the release of ''Men and Women'' and was replaced by Brazilian  [[Heitor Pereira]] (billed as Heitor TP). Saxophonist [[Ian Kirkham]], who joined the group during the ''Picture Book'' tour in 1986 and played on ''Men and Women'', became an official member.\n\nWith their third album ''[[A New Flame]]'' in 1989, Simply Red adopted a yet more mainstream popular sound aimed for commercial rather than critical success, typified by their cover of [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]]' pop classic \"[[If You Don't Know Me by Now]]\", which became their second U.S. #1 hit, and one of the biggest singles of the year internationally; and their greatest success to that point.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nHucknall was by this time an international superstar, being photographed with models and Hollywood celebrities. This seemed to harm the band's coherence as a unit, with Hucknall declaring in 1991 that Simply Red was \"essentially a solo project\". The rhythm section of Bowers and Joyce left around this time; they were replaced by bassist Shaun Ward (ex-[[Floy Joy (band)|Floy Joy]] and [[Everyday People (band)|Everyday People]]) and drummer [[Gota Yashiki]] (often billed as just Gota).\n\nThe band's career peaked in late 1991 with the release of ''[[Stars (Simply Red album)|Stars]]'', which became the best-selling album for two years running in Europe and the UK (though notably had less chart success in the US than their previous albums, still earning however a gold certification). The album spun off five top 40 singles in the UK, and the singles \"[[Something Got Me Started]]\" and \"[[Stars (Simply Red song)|Stars]]\" were also significant chart hits throughout all of Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After the tour, Tim Kellett left to form dance band [[Olive (band)|Olive]].\n\nAfter touring and promoting ''Stars'' for two years, Simply Red returned in 1995 with \"[[Fairground (song)|Fairground]]\", a dance-influenced track prominently featuring a sample from [[Zki & Dobri]]'s Goodmen project. A massive radio hit, \"Fairground\" went on to become the band's first and only UK #1. Its parent album ''[[Life (Simply Red album)|Life]]'' sold more than a million copies in the UK alone, making it the fourth-biggest seller of the year. By this time, the band was officially Hucknall, McIntyre, Pereira, Kirkham, and new backing vocalist Dee Johnson. Guest musicians (including [[Sly & Robbie]]) filled in on drums and bass. For the subsequent live shows, Simply Red were joined by new recruits' Steve Lewinson on bass, Velroy Bailey on drums, and second backing vocalist Sarah Brown.\n\n===1996\u20132000===\nMcIntyre, the only original remaining band member aside from lead singer Hucknall, left the group after the ''Life'' album, as did Pereira. From that time in 1996, Simply Red was essentially a trade name for Hucknall and a bevy of session musicians, which would vary from track to track (and gig to gig) as needed, although all post-1996 Simply Red albums and live shows did include contributions from sax player Ian Kirkham. Returning drummer Gota Yashiki (co-producing several album tracks) and backing vocalist Dee Johnson were also frequently involved with the band's later recordings and shows, as was new keyboardist/co-producer [[Andy Wright (music producer)|Andy Wright]].\n\n[[East West Records]] issued the compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Simply Red album)|Greatest Hits]]'' in 1996, reportedly against Hucknall's wishes.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The album featured one new track, a cover of the 1973 [[Aretha Franklin]] hit \"[[Angel (Aretha Franklin song)#Simply Red version|Angel]]\" which was co-produced with [[The Fugees]] (who also served as backing musicians). Released as a single, \"Angel\" reached #4 in the UK.\n\n1998 saw the release of the [[cover version|cover]]-heavy ''[[Blue (Simply Red album)|Blue]]'', which produced four UK top 40 singles, including the top 10 hits \"[[Say You Love Me (Simply Red song)|Say You Love Me]]\" and \"[[The Air That I Breathe#Simply Red version|The Air That I Breathe]]\". The follow-up album, 1999's ''[[Love and the Russian Winter]]'', was a relative disappointment, spawning two minor hits that failed to break the top 10.\n\nSimply Red were dropped from their label, East West Records in April 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hub.contactmusic.com/mick-hucknall/news/simply-red-singer-attacks-music-industry|title=Simply Red Singer Attacks Music Industry|website=Hub.contactmusic.com|date=25 March 2003}}</ref> Hucknall subsequently set up the website Simplyred.com to handle releases of new recordings; the new label/website venture proved to be quite successful, many of the band's Simplyred.com releases selling and charting almost as well as their earlier recordings.\n\n===2003\u20132010: Re-establishment as a live band and disbanding===\nBetween 2003 and its disbandment in 2010, the band's official line-up for live performances was Mick Hucknall (vocals), Ian Kirkham (saxophone/keyboards), Dave Clayton (keyboards), Kenji Suzuki (guitar), Kevin Robinson (trumpet/flugelhorn/percussion), Steve Lewinson (bass guitar) and Pete Lewinson (drums). These musicians featured on Simply Red's albums as well, though they were often augmented or replaced by session musicians. From 2003 to 2008, John Johnson (trombone), Dee Johnson (vocals), Sarah Brown (vocals) and Chris De Margary (saxophone) also appeared on both albums and tours.\n\nOn 24 March 2003, the band released ''[[Home (Simply Red album)|Home]]'', a mixture of original songs and covers, including a version of [[The Stylistics]]' \"[[You Make Me Feel Brand New]]\", which hit UK #7. The album went Double Platinum in the United Kingdom, Gold in Canada, and Platinum in Europe. It featured two other hit singles: \"[[Sunrise (Simply Red song)|Sunrise]]\" (#7 UK) and \"[[Fake (Simply Red song)|Fake]]\" (#21 UK).\n\nOn 13 October 2005, followed ''[[Simplified (Simply Red album)|Simplified]]'', mainly an album of stripped-down versions of their classic hits.  The single \"Perfect Love\" made it to number 30 on the UK chart, the band's final top 30 placing.\n\nOn 12 March 2007, the band released its tenth (and, at that time, proclaimed final) studio album, ''[[Stay (Simply Red album)|Stay]]''. This was preceded by the single from that album, \"So Not Over You\", released on 5 March 2007, which would peak at #34 in the UK. Follow-up single \"Stay\" (released on 28 May 2007) peaked at #36 UK, and was the band's final placing in the UK top 100 (although they would release several non-charting singles in the following years).\n\nOn 19 May 2008, Hucknall released his first solo album, ''[[Tribute to Bobby]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/5h54/|title= BBC music review of Tribute to Bobby|website=Bbc.co.uk|date= 20 May 2008|access-date= 26 June 2008}}</ref>  The backing musicians on the solo album were virtually the same group of musicians he had been working with as \"Simply Red\" for the last few years.\n\nHucknall announced that the name Simply Red would be retired after a farewell tour which started in early 2009 and ended in 2010.<ref name=\"Times\">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2732946.ece |title=Simply Red splitting up after 25 years |access-date=24 October 2007 |publisher=Times Online |location=London |first1=Veronica |last1=Schmidt |date=24 October 2007 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616115104/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2732946.ece |archive-date=16 June 2011 }}</ref>\n{{cquote|\"I've kind of decided that the 25 years is going to be enough, so I intend that 2009 will be the last Simply Red tour.\"}}\n\nSimply Red's final concert took place at [[the O2 Arena]] in London on 19 December 2010.
