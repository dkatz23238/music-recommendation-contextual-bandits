The music video, featuring Kershaw as a [[chroma key]]-suited [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]], received heavy rotation from [[MTV]], helping the song to reach No. 46 in the United States. He enjoyed three more Top 20 hits from his debut solo album ''[[Human Racing]]'', including the [[Human Racing (song)|title track]] and a successful re-issue of \"I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> This track ultimately proved his biggest hit as a performer when it reached No. 2 in the UK.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nKershaw's second album was ''[[The Riddle (album)|The Riddle]]''.

The album also spawned two more UK [[Top 40|Top 10]] hits, \"[[Wide Boy (song)|Wide Boy]]\" and \"[[Don Quixote (Nik Kershaw song)|Don Quixote]]\", as it went [[Music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]].
