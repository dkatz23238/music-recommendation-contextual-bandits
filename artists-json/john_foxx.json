The band played their first gig at the [[Marquee Club|Marquee club]] in August 1974, after which [[Billy Currie]] was recruited as violinist.\n\nTiger Lily released a single in 1975 on Gull Records, the A-side of which was a cover of the [[Fats Waller]] track \"[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)#Tiger Lily version|Ain't Misbehavin']]\". It was commissioned for (but not subsequently used in) a movie of the same name. The [[B-side]] was the group's own song \u2013  \"Monkey Jive\".  Tiger Lily played a few gigs in London pubs between 1974 and 1975.\n\n===Ultravox (1976\u20131979)===\n{{main|Ultravox}}\nAfter several name-changes, including Fire of London, The Zips and The Damned, the band became [[Ultravox|Ultravox!]], in July 1976. The group's style fused [[Punk rock|punk]], glam, [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[reggae]] and [[new wave music]]. At the same time, Leigh adopted his stage name of John Foxx:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03634-blackpool-neon-tango-a-john-fox-interview-about-metamatic |title=Features &#124; A Quietus Interview &#124; Blackpool Neon Tango: A John Foxx Interview About Metamatic |publisher=The Quietus |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Foxx is much more intelligent than I am, better looking, better lit. A kind of naively perfected entity. He's just like a recording, where you can make several performances until you get it right - or make a composite of several successful sections, then discard the rest.</blockquote>\n\nChris Allen, who had briefly gone by the name Chris St. John, changed his name again, to Chris Cross.\n\nOnce the band signed to [[Island Records]], they released three albums during 1977\u20131978. The first Ultravox! single, \"Dangerous Rhythm\", backed with \"My Sex\", was released on 19 January 1977. Their first album (the self-titled ''[[Ultravox! (album)|Ultravox!]]'') was released shortly afterwards, produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]] and the band, with assistance from [[Brian Eno]]. It was followed by their second album ''[[Ha!-Ha!-Ha!]]'', which included the single \"[[ROckWrok]]\", although both were commercial failures.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nFor their third album, ''[[Systems of Romance]]'', Ultravox abandoned the exclamation mark in their name. Also missing was their first guitarist, Stevie Shears, who was replaced by [[Robin Simon]], from [[Neo (UK band)|Neo]]. The album was co-produced by [[Conny Plank]]. Two singles were released from the album, \"[[Slow Motion (Ultravox song)|Slow Motion]]\" and \"[[Quiet Men]]\". Sales were modest, but the album did gain the band exposure to a wider audience, including the United States.\n\nDuring the recording of ''Systems of Romance'', a song of the same name was written, but the band had no time to record it. It was later included on Foxx's second solo album ''[[The Garden (John Foxx album)|The Garden]]''.<ref name=\"raggett1\">{{cite web|last=Raggett |first=Ned |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-garden-mw0000521554 |title=The Garden \u2013 John Foxx : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=28 December 2012}}</ref> At ''Systems of Romance'' gigs, Foxx began to perform with the band three future solo songs, \"He's a Liquid\" and \"Touch & Go\" (later included on ''[[Metamatic]]'', Foxx's first solo album) and \"Walk Away\" (included on ''The Garden'' album). The latter song was not performed again by Foxx until 1983.\n\nUltravox was dropped by their record label at the beginning of 1979.<ref name=\"discog1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discog.info/ultravox-interview4.html |title=Warren Cann/Ultravox interview |publisher=Discog.info |access-date=13 May 2012}}</ref> The band undertook a self-financed tour of the United States in February, during which they performed three new songs, \"Touch and Go\" & \"He's a Liquid\", which Foxx later recorded for ''Metamatic'', and \"Radio Beach\".<ref>{{cite web |title=ULTRAVOX!

He was replaced by [[Midge Ure]].\n\n===Solo career (1980\u20131985)===\nAfter signing to [[Virgin Group|Virgin Records]], Foxx achieved minor chart success with his first solo singles, \"[[Underpass (song)|Underpass]]\" ([[UK Singles Chart|UK]] No. 31) and \"[[No-One Driving]]\" (UK No. 32).<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited\n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 211}}</ref> Its parent album ''[[Metamatic]]'' was released on 17 January 1980, and peaked at No. 18 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> Foxx played most of the synthesisers and \"rhythm machines\", as they were listed on the sleeve. One of the album's songs, \"Metal Beat\", takes its name from a [[Roland CR-78|CR-78]] [[drum machine]] sound used on the record. Virgin released the album under the imprint name Metal Beat Records, which was used for Foxx releases throughout his contract with them.\n\nHe then worked on dozens of tracks for two projected albums, and one of these tracks, \"My Face\", was released on a [[flexi-disc]] given away with ''[[Smash Hits]]'' in October 1980.<ref>\"Bitz\", ''[[Smash Hits]]'', vol. 2 no. 20, October 1980, p. 13</ref>\n\nFoxx's next album was ''[[The Garden (John Foxx album)|The Garden]]'', released in September 1981. It reached No. 24 in the UK Albums Chart.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> Musically it was a departure from the stark electropop of ''Metamatic'' to a sound resembling Ultravox ''[[Systems of Romance]]''. ''The Garden''{{'}}s starting point was \"Systems of Romance\", written by Foxx for the earlier album but not released at the time.<ref name=\"raggett1\"/>\n\nIn 1982, Foxx set up his own recording studio, designed by Andy Munro, also called The Garden, housed in an artists' collective in Shoreditch, East London, in a former warehouse also occupied by sculptors, painters and film makers. He produced some demo recordings for Virginia Astley's first album ''[[From Gardens Where We Feel Secure]]''.<ref name=\"A\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neo-romantic.org.uk/ent-foxx.html |title=Encyclopedia of British Neo-Romanticism |publisher=Neo-romantic.org.uk |access-date=13 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813103345/http://neo-romantic.org.uk/ent-foxx.html |archive-date=13 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Foxx provided some music for the soundtrack to [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s film ''[[Identification of a Woman]]'' (''Identificazione di una Donna''). In September that year, his third solo LP ''[[The Golden Section]]'' was released ([[UK Albums Chart|UK]] No. 27).<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> A development of ''The Garden'', Foxx described the album as a \"roots check\" of his earliest musical influences.<ref name=\"A\"></ref> It was followed by a tour, his first live performances since Ultravox.<ref>[http://www.muzines.co.uk/articles/john-foxx/1753 John Foxx] Electronics & Music Maker, November 1983</ref>\n\nThe album ''[[In Mysterious Ways]]'' was issued in October 1985, which spent one week at No. 85 in the UK chart.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> Musically it was not considered a significant advance on the sound of his three previous releases, nor was it a commercial success although the album's lyrics are far more romantic than any of his previous albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tracklicensing.com/track?Track=5902 |title=Welcome to Track Licensing |publisher=Tracklicensing.com |access-date=13 May 2012}}</ref> Foxx later said that at the time he felt divorced from any contemporary musical influences. However, he did produce, co-write and play on ''Pressure Points'', by [[Anne Clark (poet)|Anne Clark]], the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pressure-points-mw0000343276 |title=Pressure Points \u2013 Anne Clark : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=16 July 2011 |access-date=28 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Withdrawal from the music scene (1985)===\nAfter ''In Mysterious Ways'', Foxx temporarily left his career in pop music. He sold his recording studio and returned to his earlier career as a graphic artist, working under his real name of Dennis Leigh. Examples of this work include the book covers of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[The Moor's Last Sigh]]'',<ref name=\"AMG\"/> [[Jeanette Winterson]]'s ''[[Sexing the Cherry]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]]' ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'',<ref name=\"AMG\"/> and several books in the [[Arden Shakespeare]] series.\n\nFoxx began to find inspiration in the underground [[House music|house]] and [[Acid house|acid]] music scenes in Detroit and London. With Nation 12 in the early 1990s, Foxx released two [[12-inch single]]s, \"Remember\" and \"Electrofear\". The first was a collaboration with [[Tim Simenon]], best known for his [[Bomb the Bass]] project.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The group also wrote the music for the [[Bitmap Brothers]] computer games ''[[Speedball 2]]'' (1990) and ''[[Gods (video game)|Gods]]'' (1991, \"''Into the Wonderful''\"). He also worked with [[LFO (British band)|LFO]] and made the music video for their eponymous debut single.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Around this time, Foxx also taught on the Graphic Arts & Design degree course at [[Leeds Metropolitan University]].<ref name=fact>{{cite web |url=https://www.factmag.com/2010/05/26/john-foxx-systems-of-romance/ |title=John Foxx: systems of romance |date=26 May 2010 |publisher=Fact Magazine}}</ref>\n\n===Re-emergence with Louis Gordon (1997)===\nOn 24 March 1997, Foxx made a return to the music scene with the simultaneous release of two albums, ''Shifting City'' and ''[[Cathedral Oceans]]'' on [[Metamatic Records]]. ''Shifting City'' was Foxx's first collaboration with Manchester musician [[Louis Gordon]].\n\nOn 11 October 1997, Foxx played his first public gig since 1983 at The Astoria, London. A limited edition twelve-track CD (1,000 numbered copies only) entitled ''Subterranean Omnidelic Exotour'' was available for purchase by ticket holders. Foxx and Gordon continued to work together, performing live on the Subterranean Omnnidelic Exotour in 1997 and 1998 and releasing a second album ''[[The Pleasures of Electricity]]'', in September 2001. Two years later they toured again, to promote the album ''Crash and Burn'', released in September 2003 on Foxx's own Metamatic Records.\n\nThree collaborative albums with Louis Gordon were released in late 2006: ''Live From a Room (As Big as a City)'', a 'live' studio album from the 2003 tour (released in association with an interview CD entitled \"The Hidden Man\") in October; the studio album ''From Trash'' in November and a further album from the same sessions a few weeks later during the accompanying mini-tour. This two-CD package, entitled ''Sideways'', included ten original tracks plus two extended versions of songs on ''From Trash''. The second disc contained an extensive interview with Foxx describing the making of ''From Trash'' which was available only at concerts on the 2006 tour.\n\nThe \"live in the studio\" recordings originally distributed in limited edition during the 1998 ''Subterranean Omnidelic Exotour'' were later made available through the double-CD issue \"The Golden Section Tour + The Omnidelic Exotour\" (2002) and the double CD re-issue of \"Shifting City\" in 2009.\nThe album \"Retro Future\" (2007) is a live on stage performance recorded on the Exotour, on 10 January 1998 at Shrewsbury Music Hall. It was released for John Foxx's 2007 Metamatic tour, and originally limited to 1000 pressings.\n\n===Collaborations===\nFoxx has performed and recorded with a variety of artists and musicians since returning to the music scene in the mid-nineties, most notably with Louis Gordon but also with [[Harold Budd]], [[Jori Hulkkonen]], [[Robin Guthrie]] (formerly of [[Cocteau Twins]]), Ruben Garcia and [[Belbury Poly|The Belbury Circle]].\n\nIn April 2005, Foxx guested on Finnish DJ [[Jori Hulkkonen]]'s album ''Dualizm'', where he provided vocals for \"Dislocated\" which Hulkkonen had written for him. Foxx and Hulkkonen issued a further collaborative EP in 2008 entitled ''Never Been Here Before''. A remix of ''Dislocated'' was issued on Foxx's 2010 compilation ''Metatronic'', while ''Never Been Here Before'' appears on the 2013 compilation ''Metadelic''. Hulkkonen played as supporting act to the first [[John Foxx And The Maths]] concert at [[The Roundhouse]] in 2010 and also joined Foxx and the band onstage to perform [[Underpass (song)|Underpass]]. A new EP entitled ''European Splendour'' issued as John Foxx + Jori Hulkkonen was released in August 2013 on the Sugarcane Recordings label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dummymag.com/new-music/2013/07/11/premiere-john-foxx-jori-hulkkonen-can-t-see-you-anymore |title=Premiere: John Foxx & Jori Hulkkonen - Can't See You Anymore |publisher=Dummymag.com |date=3 June 2013 |access-date=12 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714040317/http://www.dummymag.com/new-music/2013/07/11/premiere-john-foxx-jori-hulkkonen-can-t-see-you-anymore/ |archive-date=14 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===''Cathedral Oceans''===\nThe first volume of ''[[Cathedral Oceans]]'' was released at the same time as Foxx's comeback collaboration with Louis Gordon and the ''Shifting City'' album. In stark contrast to the latter, ''Cathedral Oceans'' is a more ethereal, ambient work combined with Foxx's own artwork of overgrown natural settings superimposed onto faces of statues.\n2003 also saw the release of the second volume of ''Cathedral Oceans'' as well as another ambient record, the double CD ''Translucence'' and ''Drift Music'' with Harold Budd.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/10/harold-budd-and-john-foxx-translucencedrift-musicn.html | title=Harold Budd and John Foxx: Translucence/Drift Music/Nighthawks (ft.

This contained his artwork made into a film intended as a \"slowly moving, hallucinogenic, digital stained glass window, intended to be projected as big as possible onto architecture and in public places.\" The work was premiered in November 2006 at the [[Leeds International Film Festival]].\nIn July 2007, Foxx exhibited some of his Cathedral Oceans artwork as large format digital prints at Fulham Palace as part of the RetroFuture exhibition hosted by ArtHertz. On the opening night, Foxx performed a piano piece accompanying a reading from his unpublished novel ''The Quiet Man'' in front of an audience for the first time.\n\nIn 2005 Foxx appeared on stage at the Brighton Pavilion with Harold Budd and [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]] as part of a concert to celebrate the work of the retiring pianist, which led to the announcement in October that year that Foxx would be involved in collaborations with [[Jah Wobble]], [[Robin Guthrie]],<ref name=\"AMG\"/> [[Steve Jansen]] and Nelson.\n\n===''Tiny Colour Movies''===\nIn June 2006, Foxx released an instrumental solo album, ''Tiny Colour Movies'', consisting of 15 instrumental tracks inspired by short art films he saw at a private screening. His official website described these as having the \"filmic, atmospheric approach\" of the ''Metamatic''-era instrumental B-sides \"Glimmer\", \"Film One\" and \"Mr No\". On 18 November 2006, Foxx gave a performance of the work at the Duke of York's cinema in [[Brighton]], where ''Tiny Colour Movies'' was premiered as part of the city's Film Festival. Edited versions of the movies were shown on a big screen for the first time with Foxx playing a mix of live and recorded accompaniment from the album. This 'film' was shown again at Fulham Palace in July 2007, and in a slightly revised format at the ICA and as part of the 21st International Film Festival, in Leeds during November that year.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nIn September 2007, a remastered edition of ''[[Metamatic]]'' was released as a two-CD pack containing the original album, plus most of the associated B-sides and extra tracks from the period, including two 'new' songs re-assembled from original music recorded at the time.\nIn the same month, a showcase of Foxx's work was held at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|Institute of Contemporary Art]] in London, where he performed another version of ''Tiny Colour Movies'' and hosted a question-and-answer session. This was followed by the first live performance of the entire ''[[Metamatic]]'' album, during which Foxx and Louis Gordon were accompanied on stage by Steve D'Agostino. Later in the evening, the DVD of ''Cathedral Oceans'' was shown in one of the ICA cinema studios. In October, Foxx and Gordon toured the UK with ''Metamatic'', culminating in a show at Cargo in London. The year ended with two shows at the Luminaire in London. A live album titled ''A New Kind of Man'', culled from the ''Metamatic'' performances in 2007, was released on Metamatic Records on 28 April 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=30776_0_2_0_C |title=John Foxx releases live album ''A New Kind of Man'' |publisher=Side-line.com |access-date=11 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nFoxx presented three different pieces of his solo work in the space of one week in June 2008. This began with a showing of ''Tiny Colour Movies'' at the Caixaforum in [[Barcelona]] on 14 June 2008, followed by a performance of Cathedral Oceans III inside the Great Hall at Durham Castle, England on 18 June. He then travelled to Italy and presented an extract from The Quiet Man at the 14th Festival Internazionale di Poesia in [[Genoa]].<ref>[http://www.kondoria.it/content/view/301/54/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040502/http://www.kondoria.it/content/view/301/54/ |date=22 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Further solo work===\nIn March 2013, Foxx took part in the ''On Vanishing Land'' project, a work by British sound artists and theorists [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]] and Justin Barton. Described as a magisterial audio-essay ''On Vanishing Land'' evokes a walk undertaken by the artists along the [[Suffolk]] coastline in 2005, from [[Felixstowe]] container port to the [[Anglo-Saxon]] burial ground at [[Sutton Hoo]]. The work integrates new compositions by John Foxx and other digital musicians Baron Mordant, Dolly Dolly, Ekoplekz, Farmers of Vega, [[Gazelle Twin]], Pete Wiseman, Raime and Skjolbrot. As part of the event presentation, on 7 March, Foxx premi\u00e8red a new piano work entitled ''Electricity and Ghosts'' with accompanying films made by himself and [[Karborn]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn December 2010 Foxx participated in the recording of [[John Cage|John Cage's]] ''[[4'33\"]]'' as part of the [[Cage Against the Machine|Cage Against The Machine]] collective.\n\nIn 2015, Foxx contributed to the soundtrack of the feature-length film ''[[Blue Velvet Revisited]]'', with [[Cult With No Name]] and [[Tuxedomoon]], which consists of footage shot during the making of [[David Lynch]]'s film, ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''.\n\n===John Foxx and the Maths===\nIn December 2009, the Metamatic website announced the new musical project John Foxx and the Maths, the name given to the work written and produced by John Foxx and [[Benge (musician)|Benge]]. Benge had already broken the news on his own blog in November calling The Maths \"a new album project\". An initial download-only single, \"Destination\" / \"September Town\", was released in December 2009 by Townsend Records and later via [[iTunes]].\n\nThe duo continued to work in Benge's studio throughout 2010 and some new tracks were previewed at the Short Circuit electronic music festival at The Roundhouse in London on 5 June 2010.\nA new album entitled ''Interplay'' was announced in January 2011 and released on 21 March. The album gained critical acclaim with ''[[The Quietus]]'' calling it \"one of the finest electronic records you'll hear in 2011.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/05597-listen-remix-john-foxx-the-maths |title=News &#124; Listen & Remix: John Foxx & The Maths |publisher=The Quietus |date=25 January 2011 |access-date=28 December 2012}}</ref> ''The Quietus''  also launched a remix competition to coincide with the release of the album. Stems of the album track ''Shatterproof'' were made available for download, remixing and re-uploading via the [[SoundCloud]] site. The competition was won by Dave Poeme Electronique. The release of the album was preceded by a remix of ''Shatterproof'' on YouTube.\n\nAnother live event featuring John Foxx and the Maths was held in April 2011. ''Back to the Phuture'' was billed as a special electronic music event \u2013 featuring live sets from Foxx, [[Gary Numan]], [[Mirrors (band)|Mirrors]] and Motor \u2013 plus a DJ set by [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]]. Again, a selection of tracks from the new album and Foxx's past works were played.\n\nA cover version of the [[Pink Floyd]] track \"[[Have a Cigar]]\" was recorded for a tribute CD issued by ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine with their October 2011 issue. It was announced shortly afterwards that the version on the CD was not the completed version, and a free download of the finished version was offered via the ''Mojo'' website.\n\nA nine-date UK tour by John Foxx and the Maths was announced in July 2011, plus live performances in Poland and Belgium. A second album, ''The Shape of Things'', was also announced prior to the tour and was initially only available for purchase at tour venues.\n\nIn January 2013, it was announced that John Foxx and the Maths would be the support act for [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]]'s ''[[English Electric (album)|English Electric]]'' Spring tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metamatic.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/45657/John_Foxx_And_The_Maths_suppor|title=John Foxx and the Maths support OMD |publisher= metamatic.com|access-date= 2016-09-08}}</ref> The 13-date tour ran from 30 March to 14 April 2013.

A short video clip of Foxx and Simon in Benge's studio was also posted on Benge's official account.<ref>{{Citation|last=zack dagoba|title=Mathy|date=2019-05-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGPKNB7ctyE |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/SGPKNB7ctyE |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|access-date=2019-05-29}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The resulting album, ''Howl'', was released in July 2020, and reached No. 80 in the UK Albums Chart in early August 2020, becoming the first John Foxx and the Maths album to chart in the UK, and Foxx's first charting album in the UK since 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/22924/john-foxx-and-the-maths/|title=JOHN FOXX & THE MATHS &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref>\n\n===''Underpass'' revisited===\nOver the years John Foxx's first solo single ''Underpass'', originally released in 1980, has come to be considered a milestone in the development of popular electronic music, and has gained recognition as iconic in the development of the [[electropop]] genre.\nIn March 2010, Berlin producer [[Mark Reeder]] remixed the track ''Underpass'' (Reeder Sinister Subway Mix) for John Foxx's CD/DVD retrospective compilation ''Metatronic''. Reeder not only remixed his versions from the original master tapes in stereo for the CD, but he also made 5.1 mixes of his own remixes and Foxx's original 1980s version.\n\nThe track was re-issued in May 2013 as a special edition 12-inch vinyl. The disc features two new remixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metamatic.com/mdiscdocs03/meta32v.shtml|title=John Foxx Official Discography |publisher= metamatic.com|access-date= 2016-09-08}}</ref> The sleeve features new artwork created by [[Jonathan Barnbrook]] who has designed the covers of all the John Foxx and the Maths releases.\n\n==Work outside music==\nIn 2000, a [[Porcupine Tree]] release called ''[[Lightbulb Sun]]'' was issued with cover art by Foxx. In December 2007, Foxx exhibited some of his photographic works in an exhibition called ''Cinemascope'' at the Coningsby Gallery in West London. The images were part of three collections, \"Grey Suit Music\", \"Tiny Colour Movies\" and \"Cathedral Oceans\". His design work was the subject of an article in the UK monthly Creative review in September 2010. Between July and August 2016 an exhibition entitled \"Europe After the Rain\" was held at the [[University of South Australia]] featuring images made from photographs and found objects gathered over a period of around thirty years by Foxx in his travels across Britain and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.edu.au/europeaftertherain|title=Europe After the Rain: Exhibition by John Foxx |publisher= unisa.edu.au|access-date= 2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2020 Foxx published ''The Quiet Man'', a collection of short stories.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://thequietus.com/articles/29186-john-foxx-the-quiet-man-fiction-extract | title=Under London: New Fiction By John Foxx | publisher=ThqQuietus.com | access-date=2021-01-01}}</ref>\n\n==Tributes and recognition==\nIn the run up to the [[John Foxx and the Maths]] Interplay tour in October 2011, ''[[Artrocker (magazine)|Artrocker]]'' ran a series of articles on Foxx, including a filmed interview taken at The Garden studios in London. Special features during the \"John Foxx Week\" also contained quotes and comments about his work from a variety of different musicians and film-makers, including [[The Orb]], [[Vincent Gallo]], members of [[Ladytron]] and [[Duran Duran]], director Alex Proyas, and [[Awaydays]] creator Kevin Sampson. The corresponding printed version ''Artrocker'' (Issue 115) also featured Foxx and [[Gary Numan]] together in an in-depth interview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artrocker.tv/magazine/article/artrocker-issue-115-on-sale-now |title=Artrocker Issue 115 |publisher=Artrocker.tv |access-date=4 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005012225/http://www.artrocker.tv/magazine/article/artrocker-issue-115-on-sale-now |archive-date=5 October 2013}}</ref> The magazine contains further tributes by Philip Oakey of [[The Human League]] and Jim Kerr of [[Simple Minds]].\n\nIn May 2013, \"Exponentialism\", an EP of four cover versions of John Foxx tracks by I Speak Machine (\"My Sex\" and \"I Want To Be A Machine\") and [[Gazelle Twin]] (\"He's A Liquid\" and \"Never Let Me Go\"), was issued on Metamatic records. In 2011, [[Gazelle Twin]] told ''Artrocker'' magazine: \"'Never Let Me Go' is a mirage of maternal comfort in a toxic and unrelenting world. It's one of those songs I wish I'd made; drenched in analogue pulses and drones. a lullaby-like synth melody accompanying an android (yet emotional) dual-vocal part. I can definitely feel a cover coming on\".\n\nIn June 2014, it was announced that Foxx was to receive an [[honorary degree]] from [[Edge Hill University]], [[Ormskirk]], Lancashire.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.edgehill.ac.uk/news/2014/06/edge-hill-university-reveals-honorary-degree-recipients-ahead-2014-graduations/ | title=Honorary degree recipients revealed ahead of 2014 graduations | publisher=Edge Hill University | access-date=1 June 2014}}</ref> He was made an honorary [[Doctor of Philosophy]] during the ceremony at the university on 21 July 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.edgehill.ac.uk/news/2014/07/ultravox-founding-singer-awarded-honorary-doctorate/ | title=Ultravox founding singer awarded with honorary doctorate | publisher=Edge Hill University | access-date=22 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Further|John Foxx discography}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], John Bush (2001).
