They are considered one of the pioneering acts of the [[Swedish death metal|Gothenburg metal scene]], which also includes bands such as [[In Flames]] and [[At the Gates]].

Three additional members, [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]], Anders Jivarp and [[Martin Henriksson]], later joined the line-up.\n\nIn 1990, the band recorded a demo entitled ''Enfeebled Earth'' before changing their name to Dark Tranquillity, which featured a largely [[thrash metal]]-influenced style of [[death metal]], comparable to early [[Death (metal band)|Death]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Septic_Broiler/Enfeebled_Earth/26665|title=Septic Broiler \u2013 Enfeebled Earth \u2013 Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=Metal-archives.com}}</ref> After releasing another demo entitled ''Rehearsal December 1990'', the band changed its name to Dark Tranquillity, and released multiple demos, including ''Trail of Life Decayed'' in 1991 and ''A Moonclad Reflection'' in 1992, which both showed a progression into the more melodic nuances of death metal that the band would explore on their later studio releases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Dark_Tranquillity/A_Moonclad_Reflection/4020/hells_unicorn/29518|title=A Moonclad Reflection \u2013 Review by hells_unicorn \u2013 Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=Metal-archives.com}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1993, the band released their debut album ''[[Skydancer (Dark Tranquillity album)|Skydancer]]''. Soon after, vocalist Anders Frid\u00e9n left the band and joined fellow Gothenburg band, [[In Flames]]. Guitarist Mikael Stanne then assumed the position of lead vocalist, and [[Fredrik Johansson (musician)|Fredrik Johansson]] was recruited to take over guitar duties.\n\n===''The Gallery'' and ''Of Chaos and Eternal Night'' (1994\u20131995)===\nIn 1994, Dark Tranquillity covered the song \"My Friend of Misery\" for the [[Metallica]] tribute album ''Metal Militia \u2212 A Tribute to Metallica''.\n\nIn 1995, the band released an EP, ''[[Of Chaos and Eternal Night]]'', which was later followed by the release of their second studio album, ''[[The Gallery (album)|The Gallery]]''.

Johansson's desire to focus on fatherhood and hold a day job, rather than dealing with the uncertainties of the music industry was incompatible with the band's need for a reliable guitarist.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} With that position now vacant, bassist [[Martin Henriksson]], who was a little reluctant to do so,{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} took over duties as guitarist, and the band brought in Michael Niklasson on bass.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} Projector saw the introduction of a lot of [[piano]], keyboard, and electronic parts into Dark Tranquillity's sound, so the band also added another member, Martin Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, on keyboards. {{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} With this new lineup, the band played live bonus tracks of the reissue of this album{{clarify|date=July 2020}} and filmed a music video for \"ThereIn\".\n\n''[[Projector (album)|Projector]]'' was released in June 1999, and was later nominated for a [[Grammys|Swedish Grammy Award]]. The album saw a major change in songwriting: while retaining growled vocals and their signature death metal sound, the band added pianos, baritone soft vocals, and verse-chorus fashion to their sound, reflecting the band's goal to strive for different musical expressions.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} Around the same time, ''Skydancer'' and ''Of Chaos and Eternal Night'' were reissued together as ''[[Skydancer/Of Chaos and Eternal Night]]''.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}}\n\n===''Haven'' (2000)===\nA year later saw the release of ''[[Haven (Dark Tranquillity album)|Haven]]'', which featured prominent electronics in comparison to previous releases. Like its predecessor, ''Haven'' was also received in a generally mixed manner by fans and critics alike.\n\nAs the band toured in 2001, the band hired [[Robin Engstr\u00f6m]] to play live, due to Jivarp's commitments as a new father.\n\n===''Damage Done'' and ''Exposures \u2212 In Retrospect and Denial'' (2001\u20132004)===\nDark Tranquillity released ''[[Damage Done]]'' in 2002, was a return to a much heavier direction, adding thicker guitar distortion, deep atmospheric keyboards, and abandoning soft vocals altogether. {{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} They released the music video for the single \"Monochromatic Stains\", followed by their release of ''[[Live Damage]]'', their first live DVD.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} In 2004, their compilation album ''[[Exposures \u2013 In Retrospect and Denial]]'', featuring one disc with rare and unreleased tracks and another with live tracks, was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=606|title=Dark Tranquillity - Exposures - in Retrospect and Denial review - Metal Storm}}</ref>\n\n===''Character'' (2005)===\n''[[Character (Dark Tranquillity album)|Character]]'' was the seventh release from Dark Tranquillity, released in 2005, and was held in much critical praise. It featured the fourth music video released by Dark Tranquillity, with the successful single \"[[Lost to Apathy]]\". After releasing the album, the band played live in [[Canada]] for the first time.\n\n===''Fiction'' (2006\u20132009)===\n[[File:Dark Tranquillity - Agglutination Festival.jpg|thumbnail|Dark Tranquillity headlining the [[Agglutination Metal Festival]], 2008]]\nIn 2007, ''[[Fiction (Dark Tranquillity album)|Fiction]]'' was released, which in turn, saw a return of Stanne's clean vocals, and the first female guest vocalist since ''[[Projector (album)|Projector]]''. The album also saw writing style that combined the stylings of ''Projector'' and ''Haven'', with the more aggressive traits of ''Character'' and ''Damage Done''.
