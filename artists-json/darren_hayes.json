He was the frontman and singer of the pop duo [[Savage Garden]] until their disbandment. Their 1997 album ''[[Savage Garden (Savage Garden album)|Savage Garden]]'' peaked at number 1 in Australia, number 2 in the United Kingdom and number 3 in the United States. It spawned the singles \"[[I Want You (Savage Garden song)|I Want You]]\", \"[[To the Moon and Back (Savage Garden song)|To the Moon and Back]]\", and Australian and US number 1 \"[[Truly Madly Deeply]]\". The duo followed the success of their debut album with ''[[Affirmation (Savage Garden album)|Affirmation]]'' (1999), which provided additional hits such as US number 1 \"[[I Knew I Loved You (Savage Garden song)|I Knew I Loved You]]\", and Australian number 3 \"[[The Animal Song]]\". Savage Garden parted ways in 2001.\n\nHayes released his first solo album ''[[Spin (Darren Hayes album)|Spin]]'' in 2002. The album sold two million copies worldwide, debuted at Number 2 in the UK and number 3 in Australia. It delivered the hit single \"[[Insatiable (Darren Hayes song)|Insatiable]]\". Hayes's second album, ''[[The Tension and the Spark]]'', was released in 2004. He parted way with his record label [[Columbia Records]] in 2006 and started his own independent record label, [[Powdered Sugar (record label)|Powdered Sugar]], from which he would release his third and fourth solo albums, 2007's ''[[This Delicate Thing We've Made]]'' and 2011's ''[[Secret Codes and Battleships]]''.\n\nAfter a decade-long hiatus, Hayes returned in 2022 with singles \"[[Let's Try Being in Love]]\", \"Do You Remember?\", \"Poison Blood\" and \"All You Pretty Things\", all taken from his fifth studio album, ''[[Homosexual (album)|Homosexual]]'', which was released in October 2022. Hayes headlined the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras#Mardi Gras Party (post Parade)|2022 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade]], and announced an Australian, UK and USA tour for 2023.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAt school, Hayes was bullied and physically and verbally abused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/dthe-voice-mentor-darren-hayes-writes-a-letter-to-his-fifteen-year-old-self-on-his-fortieth-birthday/story-fn907478-1226351716030|title=Darren Hayes writes letter to his fifteen-year-old self|first=Darren|last=Hayes|date=10 May 2012|publisher=News.com.au}}</ref> He described himself as \"a big-hearted, emotional, and excitable\" teenager, with an obsession for ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T]]''.<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/7834056/savage-garden-darren-hayes-coming-out-reactions-interview|title=Savage Garden's Darren Hayes Talks Adam Lambert, Michael Jackson and Behind-The-Scenes Reaction To His Coming Out|date=19 June 2017|magazine=Billboard|access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref> Hayes ' father was an alcoholic, and regularly subjected Hayes and his mother to violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/sep/03/darren-hayes-looks-back-what-you-cant-see-is-how-unhappy-i-was?CMP=twt_gu&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium#Echobox=1662205055-1|title=Darren Hayes looks back: 'What you can't see is how unhappy I was'|website=The Guardian|last=Gibsone|first=Harriet|date=3 September 2022|access-date=7 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/culture/music/darren-hayes-on-coming-out-divorce-and-what-makes-his-husband-perfect-20220517-p5am0w.html|title=Darren Hayes on coming out, divorce and what makes his husband 'perfect'|website=Sydney Morning Herald|last=Rocca|first=Jane|date=22 May 2022|access-date=7 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/darren-hayes-savage-garden-secrets-depression-gay_n_62bb37c9e4b094be76a90714|title=I Was One Of The Most Famous Pop Stars In The World.

Hayes was successful, despite his voice breaking in the audition, as he mentioned in an interview with [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. The cover band broke up in 1994 and Hayes formed a partnership with Jones, a duo band initially called Crush. However, another band in the UK already owned the rights to the name. Hayes and Jones submitted their first demo tape to record companies under the name Bliss, before they eventually changed their name to Savage Garden, a phrase used by [[Anne Rice]] to describe the world through the eyes of [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] in her novel ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]''. The Savage Garden is a vision of Earth in which the natural laws of the world govern over anything aesthetic or civil.\n\n[[Savage Garden]] started recording their debut album in 1995 with producer [[Charles Fisher (producer)|Charles Fisher]]. Their first single, \"[[I Want You (Savage Garden song)|I Want You]]\", was released in 1996 and was the best selling single by an Australian artist that year. The second single, \"To the Moon and Back\", topped the Australian charts at the end of 1996. The third single, \"Truly Madly Deeply\", was their second number one and was the best-selling Australian single of 1997. Their debut album, ''[[Savage Garden (Savage Garden album)|Savage Garden]]'', was the best-selling album in Australia during 1997 and the duo won ten [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]] awards.\n\nHayes moved to [[New York City]] to promote Savage Garden internationally, while Daniel Jones stayed in Brisbane. The move proved to be successful, with \"Truly Madly Deeply\" going to the top of the American charts in 1998. The ''Savage Garden'' album sold seven million copies in the US on the back of this success.\n\nIn New York City, Hayes wrote ''[[Affirmation (Savage Garden album)|Affirmation]]''. He had recently divorced his wife of several years. Parts of the album reflected the pain from the end of the relationship. ''Affirmation'' was released in 1999 and proved to be another hit, with lead single \"I Knew I Loved You\" going to number one in the United States, and the album selling six million copies worldwide by the end of 2000. The pair played the title track of the album at the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]].\n\nHayes moved to [[Sausalito]] in 2000. He became the public face of the duo, doing most of the media. Hayes announced that Savage Garden had broken up in October 2001 during a chat with an Australian journalist.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/savage-garden-confirms-split-78187/|title=Savage Garden Confirms Split|magazine=Billboard|date=5 October 2001|access-date=27 June 2022}}</ref> Hayes thought the information would be saved for a later article; it was not. When confronted with this information during the early morning hours, before an unrelated interview, Jones denied the break-up of the band. However, it appears that Jones did not believe the reporter was accurately quoting Hayes and denied what he thought was yet another break-up rumour. Still, the fact that Jones took a back seat in all promotional activities for ''Affirmation'' seems indicative that Jones was not content to remain within Savage Garden as it had operated in the past. ''Savage Garden'' had sold over 23 million albums by that stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/no-friendship-the-rift-that-destroyed-savage-garden/news-story/1ff795f81ea3ca65663fc15d7300431c|title='No friendship': The rift that destroyed Savage Garden|website=News.com.au|last=Jolly|first=Nathan|date=27 June 2022|access-date=27 June 2022}}</ref>\nLuciano Pavarotti and Darren Hayes sang \"O Sole Mio\" together in a concert in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/10/02/wb.pavarotti.txt/index.html|title=Pavarotti: The tenacious tenor|website=CNN|last=Alexander|first=Brooke|access-date=27 June 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, manager of Savage Garden, John Woodruff confirmed that Jones had announced his intention of leaving Savage Garden prior to the promotion for ''Affirmation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/the-man-behind-the-band-20050308-gdkveo.html|title=The man behind the band|website=Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 March 2005|access-date=27 June 2022}}</ref> Woodruff criticised the media for their treatment of Hayes. The duo have never issued a united statement regarding the situation, yet Hayes has guaranteed that the group will \"never, by any chance\" reunite, adding in 2020, \"Imagine if you had come out and survived a really dysfunctional and toxic relationship, and then for years later people would ask you to please get back in that relationship [...] \"I once said I'd only do it if it cured cancer and that's still how I feel.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/darren-hayes-shuts-down-savage-garden-reunion-17133/|title=Darren Hayes Shuts Down Calls for Savage Garden Reunion|magazine=Rolling Stone|last=Jenke|first=Tyler|date=21 September 2020|access-date=29 June 2022}}</ref>\n\n=== 2002\u20132004: ''Spin'' and ''The Tension and the Spark'' ===\nHayes recorded his first solo album, ''[[Spin (Darren Hayes album)|Spin]]'', which was released in 2002. The album was produced by [[Walter Afanasieff]], the producer of ''Affirmation''. ''Spin''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/darren-hayes-spin|title=Darren Hayes \u2013 Spin|website=Music OMH|last=Hubbard|first=Michael|date=1 April 2002|access-date=27 June 2022}}</ref> carried on in the same musical vein as Savage Garden, with a less soft rock sound and more edgy [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] vibe, although the first single \"Insatiable\" was a [[ballad]], reaching Number 3 in Australia. Other singles \"Strange Relationship\", \"Crush (1980 Me)\" and \"I Miss You\" also performed well in charts. The album reached the Top 5 in Australia at Number 3, and in the UK at Number 2. It also reached the top ten in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. In the United States, the album failed to make the same impact as Savage Garden's previous releases, reaching Number 35 on ''Billboard''. It was later re-issued with a bonus disc consisting of some live and studio tracks.\n\nHayes spent two years working on his second solo album, ''[[The Tension and the Spark]]''. Other than the track \"I Forgive You\", which was produced with Madonna collaborator [[Marius De Vries]], the entire album was produced by Hayes and [[Robert Conley (producer/songwriter)|Robert Conley]] (with whom he had previously toured and recorded \"Crush (1980 Me)\" for ''Spin'' and \"Do You Believe\" for Specificus). The album marked a bold change of direction for Hayes. Conley's production was almost entirely electronic, with acoustic instruments buried under walls of sequenced sounds. Although artistically this was a huge step forward and earned Hayes the strongest praise of his career, it alienated a large portion of his audience, who were expecting another album of radio-friendly pop songs. The first single, \"Pop!ular\", was released on 12 July 2004. This single reached Number One on the US Dance Charts, and fared well in the UK. Hayes's follow-up single, \"Darkness\", charted in the lower regions of the ARIA top 50 charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Darren+Hayes&titel=Darkness&cat=s|title=Darren Hayes \u2013 Darkness|website=Australian Charts|access-date=29 June 2022}}</ref>\n\nOne of his out-takes from the ''Spin'' sessions, \"[[When you say you love me (Human Nature song)|When You Say You Love Me]]\", was recorded by [[Clay Aiken]] in 2003 for his ''[[Measure of a Man (Clay Aiken album)|Measure of a Man]]'' album. It was later covered by [[Human Nature (band)|Human Nature]], resulting in an Australian top 20 single in April 2004 off their ''[[Walk The Tightrope]]'' album, and was then re-recorded in 2008 featuring Hayes himself.\n\n=== 2005\u20132006: ''Truly Madly Completely'' and parting ways with Columbia ===\nIn 2005, Hayes recorded a track he wrote with Robert Conley called \"[[So Beautiful]]\", which was included on the Savage Garden greatest hits compilation, ''[[Truly Madly Completely: The Best of Savage Garden]]''. The compilation also includes a second track by Hayes called \"California\". Both of these tracks hark back to Hayes's early sound, although still retaining some of the electronic flourishes from ''The Tension and the Spark''.\n\nOn 9 July 2006, Hayes announced that he had parted ways with [[Columbia Records]] after ten years and 24 million album sales together.\n\nThe tour following this release saw Hayes play the iconic [[Sydney Opera House]]. The performance was recorded and released on a DVD entitled ''[[A Big Night in with Darren Hayes]]''.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008: ''This Delicate Thing We've Made'' ===\n[[File:Darren Hayes S2T 2008.jpg|thumb|Hayes performing in 2008]]\nHayes finished recording his third solo album, ''[[This Delicate Thing We've Made]]'', in 2007. The album was a double-disc, with 25 tracks. Many of the tracks were co-written with Robert Conley, and a great deal of the album was written with and produced by Justin Shave, who played keyboards for part of Hayes's ''Time Machine'' tour. The album was released on 20 August 2007 on Hayes's own independent record label, Powdered Sugar, while the first single, \"[[On the Verge of Something Wonderful]]\", was released in Australia on 28 July 2007 and in the UK and online on 6 August 2007.\n\nOn 9 April 2007, Hayes released the album track \"[[Who Would Have Thought]]\" from ''[[This Delicate Thing We've Made]]'' as a teaser track on his official website, as well as his MySpace profile. This was accompanied by an animation for the song created by his partner, animator and director, Richard Cullen. Around April 2007, remixes of the album track \"Step into the Light\" were being played in clubs around the world. The album version of \"Step into the Light\" was released as a teaser on Hayes's official website and MySpace on 30 April 2007.\n\nDuring the first half of 2007, Hayes performed selected songs from the album in [[The Time Machine World Tour]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/articles/2007/09/27/darren_hayes_review_feature.shtml|title=Darren Hayes @ Newcastle City Hall|website=BBC|date=27 September 2007|access-date=27 June 2022}}</ref> small, exclusive gigs around the world. Tickets for several of these much sought after shows sold out in under ten minutes. In June 2007, Hayes embarked on a small tour of USA and Canada, stopping in New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles, along with the band [[Temposhark]]. The shows were well received with very positive reviews.\n\nOn 30 June 2007, Hayes headlined the London Gay Pride at Trafalgar Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.gay.com/headlines/11637 |title=Darren Hayes to headline London Pride |date=30 May 2007 |website=gay.com |access-date=30 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710050607/http://uk.gay.com/headlines/11637 |archive-date=10 July 2007}}</ref> He performed \"I Want You\" and \"On the Verge of Something Wonderful\", as well as a medley that included \"Pop!ular\".\n\nIn July 2007, Hayes announced The Time Machine Tour that would start out in the UK, and then move on to Hayes's home country Australia. On 29 July 2007, \"On the Verge of Something Wonderful\" was the most selected music video on [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] in the UK. On 20 August 2007, ''This Delicate Thing We've Made'' was released in the UK, America and Australia. 'The Time Machine Tour' included venues such as The [[Royal Albert Hall]] and the State Theatre in Sydney. His stage was again designed by [[Willie Williams (lighting designer)|Willie Williams]] and included a large bridge that could extend over the first few rows of seats. On the final night, at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Hayes's hometown of Brisbane, the performance was recorded in HD for a DVD release. The Time Machine Tour DVD came out in two editions: the special edition which was limited to 2000 copies and contained a four-panel, fold-out, gleaming white box, a thirty-two-page color booklet with 300 photos and notes from the artist, and the regular edition. The special edition DVD, which was only available from Hayes' website, was shipped to purchasers on 1 July, and the regular edition, which was available in shops, was released on 22 July.\n\nHayes did a mini tour in the US in November and December 2007, making appearances at [[Borders Group|Borders]] stores and performing two shows in New York City and Philadelphia.\n\nOn 18 December 2007, Hayes announced \"The Side Two Tour\". The show toured the UK in February 2008 and featured Hayes performing songs from ''This Delicate Thing We've Made'' that were not featured on \"The Time Machine Tour\", in a more intimate setting. In late 2008, the DVD ''[[This Delicate Film We've Made]]'' was announced. The DVD featured selected songs from the album, arranged in a new sequence, and set to visuals that told a loose, abstract animated narrative. The DVD entered the UK music DVD charts at Number 1.\n\n=== 2009\u20132010: ''We Are Smug'' ===\nOn 19 April 2009, Hayes teased via Twitter that he was preparing another album.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/darrenhayes/status/1558975646 |title=heading to stockholm tomorrow to start writing songs for my new album |website=Twitter |date=19 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111194729/https://twitter.com/darrenhayes/status/1558975646 |archive-date=11 January 2014}}</ref> On 8 May, Hayes announced, via his MySpace page, that he and Robert Conley had produced an album together titled ''[[We Are Smug (album)|We Are Smug]]''. The ten-track album, with a fair amount of experimentation with both lyrics and music, was made available via a link from his MySpace page, and was made free to download to gauge acceptability of Hayes's shifting musical styles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=140713037&blogId=487816886 |title=Happy Birthday |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514063512/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=140713037&blogId=487816886 |archive-date=14 May 2009 |website=MySpace |date=8 May 2009}}</ref> The album is heavily electronic with some heavy beats. It also contains some explicit content. Both Hayes and Conley share vocal duties on this album.\n\nHayes signed to Sony ATV Music Publishing for a worldwide deal in August 2009. Emma Banks from CAA UK came on board October 2009 to represent Hayes for his touring plans around the new album.\n\nAlthough the album was completed before the holidays in 2009, Hayes announced in early 2010 that he had more song ideas and he was going back into the studio, which delayed the album another year. Hayes completely finished his fourth solo album in mid-2010, working with top writer/producers from around the world and having the record mixed by [[Robert Orton (mix engineer)|Robert Orton]].\n\nHayes also recorded a song for the Finn tribute album ''[[He Will Have His Way]]'', a cover of \"Not Even Close\". It was released on [[Halloween]] 2010.\n\n=== 2011\u20132021: ''Secret Codes and Battleships'' and hiatus ===\nOn 17 April 2011, Hayes announced that he had signed a record deal with Mercury Records/Universal Music Australia and signed to EMI Services UK /Europe.
