The Action Plan compiles population data on bonobos from 20 years of research conducted at various sites throughout the bonobo's range. The plan identifies priority actions for bonobo conservation and serves as a reference for developing conservation programs for researchers, government officials, and donor agencies.\n\nActing on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM developed the Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative. This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The ZSM has conducted regional surveys within the range of the bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The ZSM's initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the ZSM has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. They have built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120210211110/http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/ | archive-date = 10 February 2012 | title = Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative | publisher = Zoological Society of Milwaukee}}</ref>\n\nWith grants from the United Nations, USAID, the U.S. Embassy, the World Wildlife Fund, and many other groups and individuals, the ZSM also has been working to:\n* Survey the bonobo population and its habitat to find ways to help protect these apes\n* Develop antipoaching measures to help save apes, forest elephants, and other endangered animals in Congo's Salonga National Park, a UN [[World Heritage Site]]\n* Provide training, literacy education, agricultural techniques, schools, equipment, and jobs for Congolese living near bonobo habitats so that they will have a vested interest in protecting the great apes \u2013 the ZSM started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.\n* Model small-scale conservation methods that can be used throughout Congo\n\nStarting in 2003, the U.S. government allocated $54 million to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases in the region and work to develop bonobo conservation programs. This initiative should improve the likelihood of bonobo survival, but its success still may depend upon building greater involvement and capability in local and indigenous communities.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Chapin M | date = December 2004 | url = http://watha.org/in-depth/EP176A.pdf | title = Vision for a Sustainable World | work = WORLDWATCH magazine }}</ref>\n\nThe bonobo population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nIn addition, concerned parties have addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organizations such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the [[African Wildlife Foundation]], and others, are trying to focus attention on the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.\n\n== Hybridization with chimpanzees ==\nResearchers have found that both central (''[[Central chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes troglodytes]]'') and eastern chimpanzees ([[Eastern chimpanzee|''Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii'']]) share more genetic material with bonobos than other chimpanzee subspecies.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Owens |first=Brian |date=2016-10-27 |title=Chimps and bonobos interbred and exchanged genes |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2110682-chimps-and-bonobos-interbred-and-exchanged-genes/ |access-date=2022-04-06}}</ref> It is believed that [[genetic admixture]] has occurred at least two times within the past 550,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-06 |title=Ancient interbreeding between chimpanzees and bonobos |url=https://cnag.crg.eu/news/ancient-interbreeding-between-chimpanzees-and-bonobos |access-date=2022-04-06 |website=cnag.crg.eu}}</ref> In modern times hybridization between bonobos and chimpanzees in the wild is prevented as populations are [[Allopatric speciation|allopatric]] and kept isolated on different sides of the Congo river.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jewett |first=Katie |date=2017-04-25 |title=The Great Divide |url=https://www.biographic.com/the-great-divide/#:~:text=The%20Congo%20River%20separates%20the,this%2C%20the%20world's%20deepest%20river. |access-date=2022-04-06 |website=www.biographic.com}}</ref>\n\nWithin captivity hybrids between bonobos and chimpanzees have been recorded. Between 1990 and 1992, five pregnancies were conceived and studied between a male bonobo and two female chimpanzees. The two initial pregnancies were aborted due to environmental stressors. The following three pregnancies however lead to the birth of three hybrid offspring.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vervaecke, Elsacker |first=Hilde, Van |date=1992 |title=Hybrids between common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and pygmy chimpanzees (Pan paniscus) in captivity |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272356540 |access-date=2022-04-06 |website=www.researchgate.net}}</ref>\n\nA bonobo and chimpanzee hybrid called Tiby was also featured in the 2017 Swedish film ''[[The Square (2017 film)|The Square]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Foundation |first=Arcus |title=Killing, Capture, Trade and Ape Conservation: Volume 4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2021-04-29 |isbn=9781108487948 |pages=111}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Basankusu]], DR Congo \u2013 base for bonobo research and conservation\n* [[Bonobo Conservation Initiative]]\n* [[Chimpanzee genome project]]\n* [[Claudine Andr\u00e9]]\n* [[Great ape personhood]]\n* [[Great Ape Project]]\n* [[Kanzi]]\n* [[List of apes]] \u2013 notable individual nonhuman apes\n* [[Lola ya Bonobo]]\n* [[Koba (Planet of the Apes)|Koba]], a fictional bonobo and antagonist of the ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' reboot series\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n<!-- CurrBiol17:619,17:1663. -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Books ===\n* {{cite book | vauthors = de Waal F, Lanting F | author-link1 = Frans de Waal | author-link2 = Frans Lanting | title = Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | date = 1997 | isbn = 0-520-20535-9 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Takayoshi K | title = The Last Ape: Pygmy Chimpanzee Behavior and Ecology | location = Stanford, CA | publisher = [[Stanford University Press]] | date = 1992 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Savage-Rumbaugh S, Lewin R | author-link1 = Sue Savage-Rumbaugh | author-link2 = Roger Lewin | title = Kanzi: The Ape at the Brink of the Human Mind | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons|John Wiley]] | date = 1994 | isbn = 0-471-58591-2}}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Woods V | author-link = Vanessa Woods | title = Bonobo Handshake | publisher = Gotham Books | date = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-59240-546-6}}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Sandin J | title = Bonobos: Encounters in Empathy | publisher = Zoological Society of Milwaukee & The Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Inc. | date = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-9794151-0-4}}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = de Waal F | author-link1 = Frans de Waal | title = The Bonobo and the Atheist | publisher = [[W.
