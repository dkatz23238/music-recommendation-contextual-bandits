They are signed to [[Nuclear Blast]]. Formed in late 1995 by [[Bj\u00f6rn Strid]] and [[Peter Wichers]], originally under the name ''Inferior Breed'', the band changed their name in late 1996 to Soilwork (meaning \"working from the ground up\").\n[[File:Soilwork Rockharz 2019 06.jpg|thumb|Singer Bj\u00f6rn Strid]]\n[[File:Soilwork Rockharz 2019 15.jpg|thumb|Guitarist Sylvain Coudret]]\n[[File:Soilwork Rockharz 2019 22.jpg|thumb|Keyboardist Sven Karlsson]]\n[[File:Soilwork Rockharz 2019 18.jpg|thumb|Bassist Rasmus Ehrnborn]]\n[[File:Soilwork Rockharz 2016 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Ex-Bassist Markus Wibom]]\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1995\u20132000)===\nThe band was formed in late 1995, originally under the name '''Inferior Breed'''. Their sound, as explained by \"Speed\" was influenced by such bands as [[Pantera]], [[Meshuggah]], and [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]].<ref name=\"MKSI\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metalkings.com/reviews/soilwork/soilweng.htm |title=Soilwork Interview |website=Metalkings.com |access-date=14 August 2007}}</ref> Upon changing their band name in late 1996 to Soilwork, they began to make more melodic music.<ref name=\"MKSI\"/>  Soilwork began work on a demo entitled ''In Dreams We Fall into the Eternal Lake''. Before the recording ever took place, bassist Carl-Gustav D\u00f6\u00f6s left the group, leaving guitarist [[Peter Wichers]] to handle the bass tracks on the demo. In a chance encounter, Soilwork met [[Michael Amott]] of [[Arch Enemy]] fame, who owned a record store in Helsingborg, and gave him a copy of their demo.<ref name=\"MKSI\"/> This ultimately led to the band signing with [[Listenable Records]]. The band had huge changes which saw them change dramatically,  giving rise to the guitar mastery of David Andersson. \nNot only did Andersson influence Soilwork but he also guest starred with Australian Demonic Drug metallers, Gangs of Old Ladies.\n\nIn 1998, Soilwork added keyboardist Carlos Holmberg and bassist Ola Flink. The band recorded and released their debut album ''[[Steelbath Suicide]]'' in May of that year. Soon after, guitarist Ludvig Svartz and drummer Jimmy Persson left, citing \"different musical opinions\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Soilwork/1481/ |title=Svartz and Persson quit |publisher=Tartarean Desire |date=12 December 2005 |access-date=23 July 2007}}</ref> Persson (now guitar and vocals in Faithful Darkness) was replaced by [[Henry Ranta]], while Svartz was replaced by Peter Wichers' uncle, Ola Frenning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourteeng.net/soilwork.html |title=Wicher's Uncle Frenning Joins |date=6 April 2005 |access-date=23 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040857/http://www.fourteeng.net/soilwork.html |archive-date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> The band toured throughout Europe in support of the album with bands such as [[Darkane]], [[Naglfar (band)|Naglfar]], and [[Krisiun]].\n\nIn 1999, Soilwork recorded their second full-length album, ''[[The Chainheart Machine]]'' but it was released in 2000. The album received critical acclaim and eventually landed them a recording contract with label [[Nuclear Blast]], allowing the band to tour with acts such as [[Defleshed]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], and even, briefly, with fellow melodic death metallers [[Dark Tranquillity]].<ref name=\"SWIF\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist,8263.sm?id=146 |title=Soilwork Interview |website=Rockdetector.com |access-date=14 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828025535/http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist,8263.sm?id=146 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=28 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to popularity (2000\u20132006)===\nIn 2000, after exhausting themselves with touring, Soilwork returned to the studio to record their third full-length album, ''[[A Predator's Portrait]]''.
