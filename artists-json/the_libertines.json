The band, centred on the songwriting partnership of Bar\u00e2t and Doherty, has also included [[John Hassall (musician)|John Hassall]] (bass), and [[Gary Powell (musician)|Gary Powell]] (drums) for most of its recording career. The band was part of the [[Post-punk revival|garage rock revival]] and spearheaded the movement in the UK.\n\nThe band gained some notoriety in the early 2000s, due to Doherty's use of illegal drugs and conflicts between Bar\u00e2t and Doherty.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4749448.stm|title=Saluting the Libertines' legend|access-date=28 November 2007|author=Dowling, Stephen|date=3 March 2006|work=BBC News|quote=won notoriety for the tumultuous relationship between front men Peter Doherty and Carl Bar\u00e2t}}</ref> Although their mainstream success was initially limited, their profile soon grew, culminating in a No.&nbsp;2 single and No.&nbsp;1 album on the UK Charts.

This lasted until they realised their collective creative capabilities and forged a bond over their shared passion for songwriting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockfeedback.com/article.asp?nObjectID=1481|publisher=rockfeedback.com|title=The Libertines \u2013 Various, UK, Throughout 2002|access-date=19 March 2007|author=Toby L|date=9 February 2004}}</ref>\nBar\u00e2t abandoned his course two years in; Doherty left his English literature course at [[Queen Mary University of London|Queen Mary, University of London]], after only a year, and they moved into a flat together on Camden Road in North London, which they named \"The Albion rooms.\"\n\nThey formed a band with their neighbour Steve Bedlow, commonly referred to as \"Scarborough Steve,\" and named themselves \"The Strand\", later discarded for \"The Libertines\" after the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s [[The 120 Days of Sodom|Lusts of the Libertines]] (\"The Albions\" was also considered, but rejected; Albion is an archaic name for Britain). They later met [[John Hassall (musician)|John Hassall]] and [[Johnny Borrell]], who played bass with the Libertines for a short period. Many of their early gigs took place in the flat shared by Doherty and Bar\u00e2t.\n\nThey had booked themselves into the Odessa studios and played at Filthy Macnasty's Whiskey Cafe in [[Islington]], where Pete was working as a barman. Roger Morton thought they had potential and offered, with a friend, to manage the Libertines. Despite a separate offer from an experienced member of the music industry, John Waller, the band accepted Morton's services as manager. However, Morton would eventually give up the job after an unsuccessful six months.\n\nIn March 2000 the Libertines met Banny Pootschi, a lawyer for [[Warner Music Group|Warner Chappell Music Publishing]]. Recognizing their potential, she took on an active role in managing them. They recorded \"Legs XI\", a set of their best 8 tracks at the time (and later a popular bootleg recording among fans). However, by December 2000, they had still not been signed and this caused Dufour, Hassall and Pootschi to part ways with the Libertines.<ref>[http://www.albionarks.com/wiki/Libertines_Interview_NME_08/06/2002]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/september_2004/libertines.html|publisher=Free Williamsburg|title=The Libertines|author=Laurence, Alexander|date=September 2004|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent success of [[The Strokes]], a band with a similar style, caused Pootschi to reconsider her position. She formed a plan (dubbed \"Plan A\") to get the Libertines signed to [[Rough Trade Records]] within 6 months. In this period, Bar\u00e2t and Doherty wrote many of the songs which ended up on their first album. [[Gary Powell (musician)|Gary Powell]] was recruited to play drums, as Paul Dufour was deemed by Pootschi to be 'too old'. On 1 October 2001, Bar\u00e2t and Doherty played a showcase for James Endeacott from Rough Trade. After Borrell failed to attend this important rehearsal, they telephoned him to discover he was on tour \"living the high life.\"  Endeacott's support led to them playing for the heads of Rough Trade, Geoff Travis and Jeanette Lee, on 11 December that year. They were told they would be signed, and the official deal took place on 21 December.\n\nThe Libertines were in need of a bassist, so Hassall rejoined the band at their request, but was informed he would have to stay in the background, as the band would be focused on the partnership of Doherty and Bar\u00e2t. After signing with Rough Trade, Doherty and Bar\u00e2t rented a flat together at 112a Teesdale Street in [[Bethnal Green]] which they named \"The Albion Rooms\" (a venue that became a location for many of their [[Guerilla gig]]s).\n\n===Success (2002\u20132003)===\n\nNow with a firm line-up, they began to play more gigs alongside [[The Strokes]] and [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]] in quick succession.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/southampton/music/libertines_iv.shtml|work=BBC News|title=The Libertines Interview|date=28 October 2002|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref> This succeeded in spreading their name around the music press, with the ''NME'' taking a particular interest in them (an interest which continued throughout their career).\n\nTheir first single was a double A-side of \"[[What a Waster]]\" and \"I Get Along\", produced by former [[Suede (band)|Suede]] guitarist [[Bernard Butler]]. It was released on 3 June 2002 to highly positive reception but received little airplay due to its liberal use of profanities. A censored version appeared as [[BBC Radio 1]] DJs [[Mark and Lard]]'s single of the week. On the week the single came out, the Libertines featured on the cover of the ''NME'' for the first time. The single reached No.&nbsp;37 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\n{{Listen|filename=Up_the_bracket.ogg|title=\"Up the Bracket\"|description=27-second clip of the start of [[Up the Bracket (song)|Up the bracket]] including iconic opening scream|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nTheir first album was recorded and produced by [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]], formerly of [[The Clash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/l/libertines-upthebracket.shtml|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=The Libertines|date=20 March 2003|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref> Entitled ''[[Up the Bracket]]'', it was recorded at the RAK studios in [[St John's Wood]], with mixing taking place at Whitfield studios. During this time, the band were playing as many gigs as possible (over 100 in 2002 alone) including support acts for the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Morrissey]].\n\nTheir second single and title track from the album, \"[[Up the Bracket (song)|Up the Bracket]]\", was released on 30 September and charted at No.&nbsp;29. This was soon followed by the release on 21 October of the album, which charted at No.&nbsp;35. They won Best New Band at the [[NME Awards]] for that year and Bar\u00e2t moved out of The Albion Rooms.\n\n===Problems (2003)===\n\nDuring the recording of ''Up the Bracket'' and in the subsequent touring, Doherty's drug use had increased greatly (he was using both crack cocaine and heroin by this time) and his relationship with the rest of the band deteriorated. The band had become fractious, and some of this tension was visible in their performances. Doherty expressed himself in the \"[[Books of Albion]]\", his personal collection of notes, thoughts and poems, and also more and more frequently on the libertines.org fan forums. His posts and writings at this time were unpredictable: at times, he seemed distressed and angry; at others, he came across as calm and happy.\n[[File:Libertine tattoo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Carl Bar\u00e2t's tattoo of the word \"Libertine\" on his right arm (in Bar\u00e2t's own handwriting). Taken from the second album cover]]\n\nThey went to the US to promote themselves and work on new material. While in New York City around May 2003, they recorded the ''Babyshambles Sessions'', where they recorded versions of current and future Libertines and [[Babyshambles]] releases such as \"Last Post on the Bugle\", \"[[Albion (song)|Albion]]\", \"In Love With a Feeling\" and \"Side of the Road\". As a mark of their commitment to the band, Doherty and Bar\u00e2t both got tattoos of the word \"Libertine\" on their arms, written in Carl's handwriting. The prelude to this moment can be heard on \"The Good Old Days\" from the Babyshambles Sessions, in which, after the lyric, \"A list of things we said we'd do tomorrow,\" Doherty yells 'Get a tattoo!' However, Bar\u00e2t became increasingly exasperated with the people with whom Doherty was associating and the drugs they brought. Bar\u00e2t quit the sessions in disgust and Doherty finished recording alone. The sessions were given to a fan called Helen Hsu who, as Doherty allegedly instructed, put them out for free on the Internet.\n\nBack in the UK, tensions continued to grow as Doherty organised and played guerrilla gigs which Bar\u00e2t did not attend. Their new single \"[[Don't Look Back into the Sun]]\" saw the return of [[Bernard Butler]] as producer. The lyrical quality of the song was praised, and the single held as a prime example of Doherty and Bar\u00e2t's songwriting talents. However, Doherty did not work well with Butler and was rarely present during the recording process. As a result, the song had to be pieced together from the vocals he provided, with Butler himself recording Doherty's guitar parts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nAs Bar\u00e2t's birthday approached, Doherty organised a special celebration gig in an attempt to smooth the tensions between them. Bar\u00e2t, however, was already attending a party organised by some of his friends, and the hosts convinced him not to leave. Doherty was left to play the gig himself. Feeling betrayed, Doherty neglected to take the train to Germany the next day for the Libertines' European tour. The Libertines were forced to play without Doherty: a guitar technician learned his guitar parts and several songs were dropped altogether. Soon, however, positions changed and it was Bar\u00e2t who refused to let Doherty into the band unless he cleaned himself up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/libertines/14490|work=NME|title=We Don't Get Along!|date=19 June 2003|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/libertines/14505|work=NME|title=Pete- Libertines Speak Out|date=20 June 2003|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref> Doherty continued to play with separate musical project [[Babyshambles]] whilst the Libertines completed tour commitments in Japan without him. Distraught and angry, Doherty burgled Bar\u00e2t's flat and was subsequently arrested. On 11 August, he pleaded guilty at the preliminary hearing to the charge of burglary.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3142801.stm|work=BBC News|title=Musician admits burgling bandmate's flat|date=12 August 2003|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/libertines/15033|work=NME|title=Pete Libertine Goes to Jail|date=8 September 2003|access-date=28 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nAmidst the internal turmoil, \"[[Don't Look Back into the Sun]]\" was released on 18 August and charted at No.&nbsp;11, the highest position they had managed at that point. The Libertines played the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Carling Weekend]] with replacement guitarist [[Anthony Rossomando]] (who later joined [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]]). On 7 September, Judge Roger Davies sentenced Doherty to 6 months in prison. He served his sentence in [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)|Wandsworth prison]]. This sentence was later reduced on appeal by Judge Derek Inman to two months.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3149610.stm|work=BBC News|title=Libertines singer's sentence cut|date=29 September 2003|access-date=6 January 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?b=news&id=13717|publisher=[[xfm]]|title=Libertine Reunited with Liberated Pete|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Second album and the end of The Libertines (2003\u20132004)===\nBar\u00e2t was waiting for Doherty at the prison gates when he was released in October 2003.

The show became ''NME'''s Gig of the Year. The Libertines went on to play three consecutive sold-out dates at the [[London Forum]] in mid-December 2003, ending in stage invasions by the fans. These gigs would be named amongst the top 100 gigs of all time by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1111104,00.html|work=The Observer|title=Masters and commanders|date=21 December 2003|access-date=6 January 2006 | location=London | first=Kitty | last=Empire}}</ref> The Libertines also went on a widely acclaimed UK tour in March 2004 that included three more consecutive sold-out dates in London, this time at [[Brixton Academy]].\n\nBanny Pootschi resigned and was replaced as manager by [[Alan McGee]], previously the founder and MD of [[Creation Records]] (most famous for signing [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]) and later to become manager of [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]]. They continued to play gigs and commenced recording their second album with Bernard Butler. However, the relationship between Doherty and Butler was as unsuccessful as before and the attempts were soon abandoned. In early 2004 the Libertines won Best Band at the [[NME Awards]], despite the fact that \"Don't Look Back into The Sun\" was their only official release during the preceding year.\n\nAs an aside from the Libertines, Doherty had recorded the vocals for \"[[For Lovers]]\", a song written by his friend and local poet [[Peter Wolfe (musician)|Peter \"Wolfman\" Wolfe]]. \"For Lovers\" was released on 13 April 2004 and reached No.&nbsp;7 in the charts, eclipsing the Libertines' highest charting single to that date. Despite Bar\u00e2t's intolerance of Wolfe and the associated drugs, he recorded guitar for the B-side to the single, \"Back From the Dead\".\n\n[[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] returned as producer for the second attempt to record the second album. Doherty had returned to his drug habit and so relationships were strained. Security hired for the protection of Doherty and Bar\u00e2t had to be used to keep them from fighting. The album was finished and Doherty left the mixing and dubbing to the others; he would not return to the studio with the Libertines for another ten years. On 14 May 2004, he was admitted to The Priory, a high-profile retreat, in an attempt to overcome his addictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?id=25169|publisher=[[xfm]]|title=Peter Doherty Admitted to the Priory|access-date=6 January 2006}}</ref> He left early,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/108598.htm|work=[[NME]]|title=Pete Libertines leaves drug rehab|date=24 May 2004|access-date=6 January 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117021606/http://www.nme.com/news/108598.htm|archive-date=17 January 2006}}</ref> then returned, only to leave again a week later on 7 June.\n\nDuring this time, Bar\u00e2t had been setting up a weekly club night called Dirty Pretty Things (a later dispute forced it to be renamed Bright Young Things) at the [[Infinity Club]] in the [[West End of London|West End]]. The day Doherty left the Priory for the second time, he went to the club and spoke with Bar\u00e2t, with Hassall and Powell present as well. Doherty told him that he was going to [[Wat Tham Krabok]] in Thailand to get clean. The Libertines performed a short set that night: it was the last time they would all play together for more than six years, and the last time Doherty would speak to Bar\u00e2t for more than nine months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/108749.htm|work=[[NME]]|title=Pete rejoins The Libertines|date=8 June 2004|access-date=6 January 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220022945/http://www.nme.com/news/108749.htm|archive-date=20 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe Libertines did not let Doherty play with them but promised that \"when he cleans up his addictions he will be immediately welcomed back into the band.\"<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3852977.stm|work=BBC News|title=Libertines star pleads not guilty|date=30 June 2004|access-date=6 January 2006}}</ref> However, Doherty had managed to achieve growing success and fame with his new venture, Babyshambles, which further reduced the likelihood of reconciliation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Libertines were still releasing fresh material. The new single \"[[Can't Stand Me Now]]\", which detailed the breakdown of the ailing frontmen's once seemingly cast iron friendship while illustrating the [[love-hate relationship]] between Doherty and Bar\u00e2t, was released on 9 August and charted at No.&nbsp;2. The song included Doherty asking the question: 'Have we enough to keep it together?' Their eponymous second album, ''[[The Libertines (album)|The Libertines]]'' was released in late August and topped the albums chart.

Members of the band reunited several times on stage through the years to play Libertines songs, but talks of a reunion remained tepid as Doherty and Bar\u00e2t concentrated on their respective bands [[Babyshambles]] and [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]]. A retrospective collection ''[[Time for Heroes - The Best of The Libertines]]'' was released in 2007.\n\nIt wouldn't be until 2010, when it was announced on 29 March, that the Libertines were to reform for the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in 2010. They were special guests to headliners [[Arcade Fire]] on Friday 27 August at [[Bramham Park]], [[Leeds]] and Saturday 28 August at Little John's Farm, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].

There were hints of more Libertines gigs in the future which both Bar\u00e2t and Doherty confirming they have received offers for gigs at some point in 2011.

Also in 2012, Doherty said that the Libertines definitely have a future as a band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/pete-doherty/6311|title=Pete Doherty: 'I want to do Eurovision' \u2013 video|date=7 April 2012|work=NME|access-date=8 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521213816/http://www.nme.com/news/pete-doherty/6311|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Reformation and ''Anthems for Doomed Youth'' (2014\u2013present)===\n[[File:Festival des Vieilles Charrues 2016 - The Libertines - 009.jpg|thumb|The Libertines at [[Vieilles Charrues Festival]] in 2016]]\nOn 20 April 2014, an image of London's Hyde Park was released to the band's Facebook page.

At their 5 July Hyde Park gig, they announced three new gigs, taking place in Alexandra Palace, on 26, 27 and 28 September.\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that Doherty had successfully completed his rehab treatment at the [[Hope Rehab Centre]] in Thailand, and had joined his bandmates in the recording of their third studio album. In January 2015 it was also revealed that the Libertines would be headlining the festival T in the Park in Scotland. In February 2015, it was announced that the Libertines would be headlining [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in August 2015. In May 2015, it was announced that the Libertines would be headlining Corona Capital Music Festival in Mexico City. In June 2015, Carl Bar\u00e2t shared an image of the band in Thailand with the caption, 'Kitchen sink dramas over track listings', suggesting that the album was now complete.\n\nIn June, the band also announced that the first single off the new album would be \"Gunga Din\", which they also debuted live at Best Kept Secret headline show, Hilvarenbeek<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-libertines/86324 |title=NME News The Libertines play new song 'Gunga Gin' at Best Kept Secret headline show \u2013 watch |work=NME |date=20 June 2015 |access-date=24 August 2015}}</ref> On 26 June 2015, the Libertines were the surprise special guests on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury 2015, and were joined by special guest [[Ed Harcourt]].

Doherty was inspired by bands such as (principally) [[the Jam]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Smiths]], and [[Chas & Dave]]. Doherty has expressed \"Still Ill\" by the Smiths as a song that means a lot to him, in an interview. Bar\u00e2t admired [[the Velvet Underground]], [[the Clash]], [[the Doors]], [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Doherty liked the written works of [[William Blake]], [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Thomas Chatterton]], whereas Bar\u00e2t preferred [[Saki]] and the [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] idea of wit.<ref>\nWills, D. 'Modern Beats', in Wills, D. (ed.) Beatdom Vol. 1 (Mauling Press: Dundee, 2007) pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nOn their collective sound, Doherty commented, \"It's like they say: [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] is the sound of a council estate singing its heart out, and the Libertines is the sound of someone just put in the rubbish chute at the back of the estate, trying to work out what day it was\".<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/wunARwuww-8 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120124143309/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wunARwuww-8 Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wunARwuww-8 |title=Interview, 7 Ages Of Rock \u2013 Indie / BBC1 2007 |via=YouTube |date=5 July 2007 |access-date=24 October 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nDoherty and Bar\u00e2t followed one common dream whilst in the Libertines: \"It's either to the top of the world, or the bottom of a canal\", Bar\u00e2t once said this phrase to Doherty in the early days of their friendship.\n\nThe Libertines' lyrics occasionally reference their idea of sailing on \"the good ship [[Albion]] to [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]]\". This idea was especially important to Doherty who has continued the theme when writing for Babyshambles. He thinks of Arcadia as a utopia without any rules or authority.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,871348,00.html|work=The Guardian|title=We believe in melody, hearts and minds|date=10 January 2003|access-date=6 January 2006 | location=London | first=Dorian | last=Lynskey}}</ref>\n\nTheir recordings were fairly [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]]. Mick Jones' recording method was hands-off: he allowed the band to perform one song several times through and would then choose the best take. He performed minimal [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] and [[dubbing (music)|dubbing]]. While Bernard Butler was less strict with this, the final sound still came across as raw and unpolished.\n\nThe band has been compared to many classic British rock bands, as their angle on rock is uniquely British. Their sound is often likened to that of the Jam and [[the Kinks]]' early records as well as [[the Clash]]'s first album and early singles. They are perhaps most similar to pioneer rockers, [[Buzzcocks]]. [[Morrissey]] is another strong influence cited by the band members. Many of their lyrics refer to elements of British life, use English/[[cockney]] slang and are sung in a near-drunken sounding slur. In their attitude they are sometimes compared to the [[Sex Pistols]] due to their chaotic and energetic live performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/l/libertines-upthebracket.shtml|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Up the Bracket|date=20 March 2003|access-date=6 January 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe Libertines were praised for forming a very close relationship with fans. The band befriended several of their fans, and their [[Guerrilla gig]]s allowed devoted supporters to see them in close proximity. The film ''Fuck the Police'', shot in 2003 by Anne McCloy, captured one such gig at The Albion Rooms when the police raided and closed down an impromptu gig after complaints by irate neighbours. Doherty published the \"Books of Albion\" online, sharing his personal thoughts and feelings freely. He also frequently posted on the fan forums. This allowed fans a deep insight into his life and helped cement the relationship between the band and the public. They were also very free with their recordings, releasing songs free onto the internet and via word-of-mouth giveaways. This allowed their fan base to hear unfinished songs or ideas, some of which would grow into finished versions on the albums, some of which would be discarded.\n\nThe Libertines have had two biographies written about them, both written after the band split. The first was ''Kids in the Riot: High and Low with The Libertines'' written by Peter Welsh, a friend. The second was ''[[The Libertines Bound Together]]: The Story of Peter Doherty and Carl Bar\u00e2t and How They Changed British Music'' written by Anthony Thornton and [[Roger Sargent (photographer)|Roger Sargent]], an ''NME'' journalist and photographer respectively who had followed the band from an early stage.\n\nThe Libertines have had a lasting effect on the British music scene.<ref name=independent0703>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/after-the-libertines-what-todays-bands-owe-carl-and-pete-439391.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608030141/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/after-the-libertines-what-todays-bands-owe-carl-and-pete-439391.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 June 2008|title=After The Libertines: What today's bands owe Carl and Pete|access-date=27 February 2008|author=Thornton, Anthony |author-link=Anthony Thornton (writer)|date=9 March 2007|work=[[The Independent]] | location=London}}</ref> The image of Doherty and Bar\u00e2t entwined, Bar\u00e2t looking up protectively as his friend leans into his shoulder, on the front of their second album, has been called by Anthony Thornton \"one of the most iconic rock images of the last decade\".\n\n===''The Libertines: Bound Together''===\nWriter [[Anthony Thornton (writer)|Anthony Thornton]] and photographer [[Roger Sargent (photographer)|Roger Sargent]]<ref name=\"Roger Sargent Photography\">{{cite web|url=http://rogersargent.carbonmade.com |title=Roger Sargent Photography |publisher=Rogersargent.carbonmade.com |access-date=24 August 2015}}</ref> collaborated on a best-selling book about the band.
