Often referred to by the media as the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|\"Goddess of Pop\"]],<ref name=GoddessOfPop /> she has been described as embodying female autonomy in a male-dominated industry. Cher is known for her distinctive [[contralto]] singing voice and for having worked in numerous areas of entertainment, as well as adopting a variety of styles and appearances throughout her six-decade-long career.\n\nCher gained popularity in 1965 as one-half of the [[folk rock]] husband-wife duo [[Sonny & Cher]] after their song \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" peaked at number one on the US and UK charts. Together they sold 40&nbsp;million records worldwide. Her solo career was established during the same time, with the top-ten singles \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]\" and \"[[You Better Sit Down Kids]]\". She became a television personality in the 1970s with her [[CBS]] shows; first ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]'', watched by over 30&nbsp;million viewers weekly during its three-year run, and then the namesake ''[[Cher (TV series)|Cher]]''. She emerged as a fashion trendsetter by wearing elaborate outfits on her television shows.\n\nWhile working on television, Cher released the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles \"[[Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves]]\", \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]]\", and \"[[Dark Lady (song)|Dark Lady]]\", becoming the female artist with the most number-one singles in United States history at the time. After her divorce from [[Sonny Bono]] in 1975, she released the [[disco]] album ''[[Take Me Home (Cher album)|Take Me Home]]'' (1979) and earned $300,000 a week for her 1979\u20131982 [[Cher in Concert|concert residency in Las Vegas]].\n\nIn 1982, Cher made her Broadway debut in the play ''[[Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' and starred in its [[Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|film adaptation]]. She subsequently garnered critical acclaim for her performances in films such as ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), ''[[Mask (1985 film)|Mask]]'' (1985), ''[[The Witches of Eastwick (film)|The Witches of Eastwick]]'' (1987), and ''[[Moonstruck]]'' (1987), the last of which won her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She then revived her music career by recording the rock-inflected albums ''[[Cher (1987 album)|Cher]]'' (1987), ''[[Heart of Stone (Cher album)|Heart of Stone]]'' (1989), and ''[[Love Hurts (Cher album)|Love Hurts]]'' (1991), all of which yielded successful singles such as [[I Found Someone (Cher song)|\"I Found Someone\"]], \"[[If I Could Turn Back Time]]\", and \"[[Love and Understanding]]\". Cher contributed to the [[Mermaids (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for her next film, ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'' (1990), which spawned the UK number-one single \"[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)#Cher version|The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]\". She made her directorial debut with a segment in the abortion-themed anthology ''[[If These Walls Could Talk]]'' (1996).\n\nCher reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the [[dance-pop]] album ''[[Believe (Cher album)|Believe]]'', whose [[Believe (Cher song)|title track]] topped the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1999|''Billboard'' Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1999]] and became the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK. It features pioneering use of [[Auto-Tune]] to distort her vocals, known as the \"Cher effect\". Her 2002\u20132005 [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour]] became one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time, earning $250&nbsp;million. In 2008, she signed a $60&nbsp;million deal to headline [[the Colosseum at Caesars Palace]] in Las Vegas for three years. During the 2010s, she landed starring roles in the films ''[[Burlesque (2010 American film)|Burlesque]]'' (2010) and ''[[Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again]]'' (2018) and released studio albums ''[[Closer to the Truth]]'' (2013) and ''[[Dancing Queen (album)|Dancing Queen]]'' (2018), both of which debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nHaving sold 100&nbsp;million records, Cher is one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. [[List of awards and nominations received by Cher|Her achievements]] include a [[Grammy Award]], an [[Emmy Award]], an [[Academy Award]], three [[Golden Globe Awards]], a [[Cannes Film Festival]] award, the [[Billboard Icon Award|''Billboard'' Icon Award]], and awards from the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] and the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]]. She is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a ''Billboard'' chart in six consecutive decades, from the 1960s to the 2010s. Aside from music and acting, she is noted for her political views, social media presence, philanthropic endeavors, and social activism, including [[LGBT]] rights and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== 1946\u20131961: Early life ===\n[[File:Cher HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photograph of a young, dark-haired girl looking at the camera and smiling.|Cher in high school (1960)]]\nCher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in [[El Centro, California]], on May 20, 1946.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=17}} Her father, John Sarkisian, was an [[Armenian Americans|Armenian-American]] truck driver with drug and gambling problems; her mother, [[Georgia Holt]] (born Jackie Jean Crouch), is a former model and retired actress who claims Irish, English, German, and Cherokee ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://etcanada.com/news/284868/cher-refuses-to-apologize-for-half-breed-after-twitter-war-fuelled-by-trumps-diversity-coalition-appointee/|title=Cher Refuses To Apologize For 'Half-Breed' After Twitter War Fuelled By Trump's Diversity Coalition Appointee {{!}} ETCanada.com|date=December 31, 2017|publisher=[[Entertainment Tonight Canada]]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bego|2001|p=11}}: Sarkisian's profession;<br />{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=17}}: Sarkisian's nationality and personal problems, Crouch's profession;<br />{{cite magazine|last=Cheever|first=Susan|author-link=Susan Cheever|url= http://people.com/archive/in-a-broken-land-vol-39-no-19/|title=In a Broken Land|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 17, 1993|access-date=January 16, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161227055224/http://people.com/archive/in-a-broken-land-vol-39-no-19/|archive-date=December 27, 2016}}: Sarkisian's nationality, Crouch's ancestry.</ref> Cher's father was rarely home when she was an infant,{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}} and her parents divorced when Cher was ten months old.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=17}} Her mother later married actor John Southall, with whom she had another daughter, Georganne, Cher's half-sister.{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nNow living in Los Angeles, Cher's mother began acting while working as a waitress. She changed her name to Georgia Holt and played minor roles in films and on television. Holt also secured acting parts for her daughters as extras on television shows like ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}} Her mother's relationship with Southall ended when Cher was nine years old, but she considers him her father and remembers him as a \"good-natured man who turned belligerent when he drank too much\".{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=18}} Holt remarried and divorced several more times, and she moved her family around the country (including New York, Texas, and California).{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}} They often had little money, and Cher recounted having had to use rubber bands to hold her shoes together.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=18}} At one point, her mother left Cher at an orphanage for several weeks.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=10}} Although they met every day, both found the experience traumatic.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=18}}\n\nWhen Cher was in fifth grade, she produced a performance of the musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice.{{sfn|Cher|Coplon|1998|p=39}} Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was [[Audrey Hepburn]], particularly due to her role in the 1961 film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.

The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, \"[she] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality.\"{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=21}} A former classmate commented, \"I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special&nbsp;... She was like a movie star, right then and there&nbsp;...

She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher's unconventional behavior stood out: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a [[midriff]]-baring top.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=22}} She later recalled, \"I was never really in school.
