The founding members are lead singer/guitarist [[Isaac Brock (musician)|Isaac Brock]], drummer [[Jeremiah Green]], and bassist [[Eric Judy]]. Strongly influenced by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[XTC]], and [[Talking Heads]], they rehearsed, rearranged, and recorded demos for almost two years before finally signing with small-town indie label [[K Records]] and releasing numerous singles.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/72297]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSince their 1996 debut album, ''[[This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About]]'', the band's lineup has mostly centered on Brock and Green, undergoing multiple changes. The band achieved mainstream success with their fourth album, ''[[Good News for People Who Love Bad News]]'' (2004), and its singles \"[[Float On (Modest Mouse song)|Float On]]\" and \"[[Ocean Breathes Salty]]\". Judy performed on every Modest Mouse album until his departure in 2012. [[Guitar]]ist [[Johnny Marr]] (formerly of [[the Smiths]]) joined the band in 2006, shortly following [[percussion]]ist [[Joe Plummer]] (formerly of [[the Black Heart Procession]]) and multi-instrumentalist [[Tom Peloso]], to work on the album ''[[We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank]]'' (2007). Guitarist [[Jim Fairchild]] joined the band in 2009. The band's sixth album, ''[[Strangers to Ourselves]]'', was released on March 17, 2015. Their seventh album, ''[[The Golden Casket]]'', released on June 25, 2021.\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation and early years: 1992\u20131999 ===\nWhen Isaac Brock was a teenager, he was employed at a local family video store just outside Seattle, where he met bassist [[Eric Judy]]. Brock and Judy later discovered drummer [[Jeremiah Green]],<ref name=\"Carpenter, Susan 2004\">Carpenter, Susan. \"THE ARTS; POP MUSIC; from Modest Beginnings ...; nearly 15 Years from its Seattle Grunge Origins, Modest Mouse's Career has Taken a Mighty Turn\".

Brock says he made a point of the band being from Issaquah to avoid association with the music scenes of Seattle or Olympia and to keep with the band's suburban lyrical themes. In 1994, at [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]]'s Dub Narcotic Studios, Modest Mouse recorded its first [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?]]'', which was released by [[K Records]]. This was followed by a single, \"[[Broke (Modest Mouse song)|Broke]]\", recorded by Steve Wold (a.k.a. bluesman [[Seasick Steve]]) under [[Sub Pop]] records at Moon Studios in [[Olympia, Washington]]. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, ''[[Sad Sappy Sucker]]'', but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before the band made its way into the pop music world in 2004, many of Modest Mouse's tours included stops at DIY/punk venues such as [[Speak in Tongues]] in Cleveland, Ohio, where they continued to play even after becoming popular enough to fill larger venues.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sandy |first1=Eric |title=Speak In Tongues: An Oral History of Cleveland's Infamous DIY Punk Venue |date=2022 |publisher=Microcosm Publishing |location=Portland |isbn=9781648410642 |url=https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/books/29099 |access-date=30 August 2022}}</ref>\n\nAfter moving to [[Up Records]],<ref>\"[http://epitonic.com/artists/modest-mouse/ Modest Mouse]\" [bio].

Steve Wold also recorded and produced this album (and at the time was assisting in the recordings as well, but was not officially part of the band) along with the next offering, ''[[Interstate 8 (album)|Interstate 8]]''. The 1997 album, ''[[The Lonesome Crowded West]]'' (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) served as the band's breakthrough. ''The Lonesome Crowded West'' gained the band a [[cult following]], and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=McMurray|editor-first= Jacob|title=Taking Punk to the Masses: From Nowhere to Nevermind: a Visual History from the Permanent Collection of Experience Music Project|publisher=Fantagraphics Books|location=Seattle|year=2011|isbn=9781606994337|oclc=1065713061}}</ref> During this time, Nick Kraft became involved with the task of refining the band's sound.
