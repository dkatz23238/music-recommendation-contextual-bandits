VNV Nation's sound blends poetic and thought provoking lyrics with a sound that ranges from melodic [[electronic body music|industrial dance]] anthems, to haunting ballads and [[Post-classical history|post-classical]] soundtrack pieces. Their 2015 album ''[[Resonance: Music For Orchestra Vol. 1]]'' achieved #4 ''Classical'' <ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Chart Search|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/search?artistname=vnv+nation&charttitle=resonance&label=&chartcode=&chart_date=|access-date=2021-04-08|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> & #3 ''Classical Crossover'' <ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Classical Crossover Albums Chart|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/classical-crossover-albums/2015-05-30|access-date=2021-04-08|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>''Billboard'' chart positions in the US.

In 1983, he joined a band named ''Die Fabrik'', whose punk-inspired noise and synth style was not well received in Dublin. By 1987, Harris moved to London where, in 1989, he began to compose music under the name ''Nation'' - a [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984 film)|1984]]-inspired, electronic orchestral music project. Harris relocated to Toronto, Canada in 1990, but his music output stagnated until 1994 when he revived ''Nation'', modified by his newfound motto: \"Victory Not Vengeance\" to become VNV Nation.<ref name=\"culture_shock_3\">{{cite journal |title=VNV Nation: Ouis Contra Nos? |journal=Culture Shock |date=1996 |volume=3 |issue=96 |pages=32\u201333 |publisher=Genocide Project |location=Hackensack, NJ |language=English |issn=1093-1651 |url=https://archive.org/details/cultureshocktransmission31996}}</ref>\n\n===Early years: ''Advance and Follow'' (1995) and ''Praise the Fallen'' (1998)===\nThe group's first release, ''[[Advance and Follow]]'', came out in 1995. ''Advance And Follow'' featured industrial electronic beats heavily influenced by middle-era EBM acts such as [[Nitzer Ebb]] and [[Front 242]], along a mixture of danceable synthesizer melodies, and elements of [[orchestra|orchestral music]]. Although it was the band's first full-length release, Harris regards ''Advance and Follow'' more as a set of demos than a proper album.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Tom|title=VNV Nation: \"We wanted to offer people an alternative of substance over pure style\"|url=http://www.westword.com/music/vnv-nation-we-wanted-to-offer-people-an-alternative-of-substance-over-pure-style-5683636|website=Westword.com|access-date=7 September 2015}}</ref> In 2001, it was re-released as ''Advance and Follow 2.0'', with updated production, re-recorded vocals, and five bonus tracks, which include two Front 242 covers.\n\nTheir next release, ''[[Praise the Fallen]]'' in 1998, continued largely in this vein, and they began to enjoy a larger degree of commercial success.\n\nDuring that time, Harris also wrote for the online magazine ''[[Side-Line]]'', of which he was the webmaster until 1999.<ref name=\"culture_shock_3\" />\n[[Image:VNV Nation Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|VNV Nation live in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]\n\n===''Empires'' (1999)===\n''[[Empires (VNV Nation album)|Empires]]'', released in 1999, was their breakthrough album, gaining them widespread commercial success and topping the German DAC charts for seven weeks.<ref name=\"dac-albums-99\">{{cite web |title=DAC Top 50 Albums 1999 |url=http://www.public-propaganda.de/charts/1999/dac_alb50.html |website=Trendcharts oHG |publisher=AMC Alster Musik Consulting GmbH |access-date=20 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010418190612/http://www.public-propaganda.de/charts/1999/dac_alb50.html |archive-date=18 April 2001 |date=2000 |url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Empires'' expanded on the band's bombastic, melodic synthesizer lines and incorporated tighter song structures. Furthermore, the harsher 'sheet metal instrumentals' of ''Praise the Fallen'' were largely gone, and the music as a whole was far more complex with multiple-layered arpeggios and pads. The album was composed using a mix of analog and digital synthesizers, and an [[Ensoniq ASR-10]] sampler. Notable analog synthesizers used on the album included the [[ARP 2600]], which was used for most of the sounds on the tracks \"Firstlight,\" \"Arclight,\" and \"Standing,\" the SCI [[Sequential Circuits|Pro One]], and an [[Oberheim OB-1]]. Digital synthesizers used were the [[Roland JP-8000]], [[Access Virus]] (used almost exclusively on the track Darkangel), [[Korg Trinity]], the EMU Proteus 2000 and the [[Roland JV-1080]].\n\n===''Futureperfect'' (2002)===\nTheir 2002 album, ''[[Futureperfect]]'', while retaining many industrial elements represented a departure in many ways, largely away from EBM and towards trance and synthpop. Some neoclassical instrumental pieces were included in the album. Around this time Ronan Harris and [[Apoptygma Berzerk]]'s Stefan Groth were credited with coining the term \"[[futurepop]]\" to describe their sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sortedmagazine.com/Sordid.php3?nID=261|website=Sortedmagazine.com|title=Being a little bit productive}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://releasemagazine.net/Spotlight/spotlightvnvnation.htm|title=VNV Nation - Release Music Magazine Spotlight|website=Releasemagazine.net|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref> This shift caused their mainstream popularity to increase still further, but alienated some of their fans who preferred their earlier harsher and darker sound. Notably, the album was produced using only software synthesizers instead of hardware synthesizers. It was the first VNV Nation album made entirely with software synthesizers.\n\nThe band embarked on a highly successful world tour in support of ''Futureperfect'' from 2001 to 2003. Their concerts in Berlin, Washington DC, and the [[M'era Luna Festival]] were recorded and edited together for release as the ''[[Pastperfect]]'' DVD.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pastperfect: Metropolis Mail-Order|url=https://www.metropolis-mailorder.com/product.php?prodnum=MET+294|access-date=7 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013131407/http://www.metropolis-mailorder.com/product.php?prodnum=MET+294|archive-date=13 October 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===''Matter + Form'' (2005)===\nTheir 2005 album, ''[[Matter + Form]]'', expanded on the soundscape established with ''Futureperfect''. Notable for this harder-edged sound was the first single \"Chrome\". Also of note is the lack of effects applied to the vocals, a departure from previous albums, which allows Harris' voice more space in the mix. There were also several songs with a softer and more pensive theme. Some songs even had a slight \"rock\" feeling to them, mostly from how drum sequences and bass lines were arranged, the most obvious example being the final song, \"Perpetual\". The assortment of instruments used in the production was much larger than on previous albums. While mostly composed using software synthesizers, several different analogue modular synthesizers were used, along with an array of vintage effects. This album was also the first time the band used an outside producer. Both ''Matter + Form'' and \"Chrome\" peaked at #1 on the DAC Albums and Singles charts, respectively.<ref name=\"dac-albums-05\">{{cite web |title=DAC Top 50 Albums 2005 |url=http://charts.trendcharts.de/jahrescharts2005/DAC/top50.html |website=Trendcharts oHG |publisher=AMC Alster Musik Consulting GmbH |access-date=20 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423220622/http://charts.trendcharts.de/jahrescharts2005/DAC/top50.html |archive-date=23 April 2008 |date=2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"dac-singles-05\">{{cite web |title=DAC Top 100 Singles 2005 |url=http://charts.trendcharts.de/jahrescharts2005/DAC/index.html |website=Trendcharts oHG |publisher=AMC Alster Musik Consulting GmbH |access-date=20 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423203707/http://charts.trendcharts.de/jahrescharts2005/DAC/index.html |archive-date=23 April 2008 |date=2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===''Judgement'' (2007)===\nVNV Nation's next studio album was ''[[Judgement (VNV Nation album)|Judgement]]'', released on 4 April 2007. Containing ten tracks, it continued the evolution of the VNV Nation sound. While written and recorded in VNV Nation's own studio, located in the now defunct Soundfactory Studios in Hamburg, the album production took advantage of the main studio's facilities through the use of its collection of vintage microphones and effects, and mixing the album on the studio's ADT console.\n\nOn 25 April 2007, at the sold-out show at The Metro in Chicago, Harris stated that the rumours about ''Judgement'' being the last album were false and that more was to come and that ''Judgement'' was just the beginning.\n\nAt the alternative electronic music festival [[Infest (festival)|Infest]] in [[Bradford]] on 26 August 2007, just after the [[murder of Sophie Lancaster]], Harris dedicated the song \"Illusion\" to her and contacted the family soon afterwards to offer his condolences.<ref>{{YouTube|-JWd-XRYVN4|VNV Nation \u2013 Illusion}} Infest 2007.

On the 10th, they played a standard electronic set, and on the 11th, they performed with Ronan Harris on vocals accompanied by a full [[symphony orchestra]] for the first time. That orchestra was the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra|Gewandhausorchester]], one of the most traditional German orchestras, which had already premiered works by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] or [[Franz Schubert]]. The show was recorded for release, but a problem with the recording equipment rendered the audio unusable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/VNVNation/posts/10151766732956258 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/42907656257/10151766732956258 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |url-access=limited|title=VNV Nation|website=Facebook.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref> As a result, Ronan began to work with the arranger on an album of VNV Nation songs scored for orchestra, which would include the tracks performed at Gothic Meets Klassik as well as additional songs.
