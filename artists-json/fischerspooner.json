The name is a combination of the founders' last names, [[Warren Fischer]] and [[Casey Spooner]].\n\n==Career==\nOriginally a duo formed by classically trained musician Warren Fischer and video-artist and experimental theater performer Casey Spooner for an impromptu rendition of their makeshift track \"Indian Cab Driver\" at the [[Astor Place]] [[Starbucks]], the group grew to over 20 performers, most of whom are dancers and guest vocalists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/181-fischerspooner|title=Fischerspooner - Artist Profile}}</ref> \"We started as a performance art piece about entertainment that ultimately became legitimate entertainment,\"<ref name=suicidegirls>{{cite web\n |url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Casey+Spooner%3A+Fischerspooner/\n |title = Casey Spooner: Fischerspooner\n |work = [[SuicideGirls]]\n |date = 27 April 2009\n |access-date = 27 April 2009\n }}\n</ref> said Casey Spooner, when talking about the group's origins in an April 2009 interview.\n\n===''#1'' (2001)===\nTheir debut album, ''[[1 (Fischerspooner album)|#1]]'', has been released on several record labels, including [[International DJ Gigolo]], [[Ministry of Sound]] and [[Capitol Records]], and includes their hit singles \"Sweetness\", \"[[Emerge (song)|Emerge]]\", and a cover of [[Wire (band)|Wire]]'s \"[[the 15th]]\". In the final months of 2004, Fischerspooner opened up their FS Studios in [[New York City]] to the public for a few hours once a week, allowing people to meet the band and production team, as well as preview new video, music and dance projects that they were working on.\n\n===''Odyssey'' (2005)===\nIn 2005, ''[[Odyssey (Fischerspooner album)|Odyssey]]'', the band's second album, was released. The album featured songs that were more structured and more accurately described as [[electropop]] than [[electroclash]]. \"''Odyssey'' was really about being on [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], which was this icon of classic American music, trying to embrace that clich\u00e9 and find a way to embody it and infiltrate it and take it apart at the same time\",<ref name=suicidegirls /> says Spooner.\n\nThe lead single, \"Just Let Go\", featuring live drums and guitars, possessed a markedly different sound than those heard on their debut album. \"Just Let Go\" was featured on season 2, episode 15 of ''[[Nip/Tuck]]''; \"All We Are\" was also featured on the same TV series, in season 3, episode 1. The second single, \"Never Win\", went on to become the album's biggest hit, and was well received in both clubs and radio. Furthermore, it was also featured in the 2006 [[Happy Madison]] movie ''[[Grandma's Boy (2006 film)|Grandma's Boy]]''. \"A Kick in the Teeth\" was rumored to be the album's third, and possibly final, single but was only pressed on 12\" that included a remix by [[Tiefschwarz]]. This was followed after a duration of silence by a 12\" remix of \"We Need a War\" with a mix by DJ Hell. Other remixes believed to have been done are of \"All We Are\" and \"Get Confused\". \"All We Are\" was featured as the credits track in the first episode of season two of Sweetbitter.\n\nAfter the album's release, Fischerspooner toured a new, more elaborate show in Europe, but the band found themselves without the funds to tour the show fully in North America. \"I was incredibly frustrated because I had worked two years on this huge record and I was only able to perform for three months\",<ref name=suicidegirls /> recalls Spooner, who subsequently retreated to his theatrical roots, joining experimental New York performance ensemble [[The Wooster Group]]. During this period, it was unclear whether the band would record together again; and, in May 2007, the band was released from its [[Capitol Records]] recording contract.\n\n===''Entertainment'' (2009)===\nEarly European gig recordings of \"The Best Revenge\" surfaced on the internet during summer 2007. \"The Best Revenge\" was released on January 14, 2008 with French label [[Kitsune Music]]. The track includes a remix package from the likes of [[Autokratz]], [[Tocadisco]], Alex Gopher, The Passions and Tony Senghore. Fischerspooner also released \"Danse en France\" as a single on the Kitsun\u00e9 label.\n\nWarren and Casey subsequently began to work on more material for a new album while Casey was performing the role of Ophelia's brother Laertes in The Wooster Group's production of Hamlet (Fischerspooner also contributed two original songs to the production).\nReleased in North America via the band's own label FS Studios on May 4, 2009, ''[[Entertainment (Fischerspooner album)|Entertainment]]'' is their third full-length album and was produced by Jeff Saltzman (The Killers, The Black Keys, The Sounds).\n\nThe album's cover was listed on Pitchfork's worst album covers of 2009.\n\n===''Sir'' (2018)===\nThe album ''[[Sir (album)|Sir]]'', executive-produced and co-written by [[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M.]] and [[Boots (musician)|Boots]], was released on February 16, 2018 on Ultra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/2017/9/01/digital-butch-casey-spooners-aggressively-homosexual-pop-music|title=Digital Butch: Casey Spooner's 'Aggressively Homosexual' Pop Music|date=September 1, 2017|website=www.out.com|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The band released the first single \"Have Fun Tonight\" on June 19, 2017. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/fischerspooner-team-with-michael-stipe-for-new-song-have-fun-tonight-watch-the-video/|title=Fischerspooner Team with Michael Stipe for New Song \"Have Fun Tonight\" |last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=June 19, 2017|access-date=June 19, 2017|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]}}</ref> The song \"Top Brazil\", was released on January 19, 2018; along with an electro-pop music video which Billboard called, \"provocative.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8095037/fischerspooner-erotic-topbrazil-music-video-bathhouse|title=Fischerspooner Releases Erotic NSFW 'TopBrazil' Music Video: Watch|website=Billboard|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> \nNPR interpreted the album as a retrospective collage of Reagan-era queer references framed in an undeniably contemporary style; \n\n\"Even the cheapskate metaphor passions in the lyrics, read as physical, often NSFW desires \u2014 'raging motorcycle thoroughbred,' 'not opposed to humiliation,' 'denim on denim,' 'dorsal fins at night in Berlin,' 'Butterscotch Goddam,' 'dark pink Saturday night' \u2014 that are dated just enough to seem older and odder.
