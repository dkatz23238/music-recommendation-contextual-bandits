The band experienced several line-up changes, with Siouxsie and Severin being the only constant members. They disbanded in 1996, with Siouxsie and Budgie continuing to record music as [[the Creatures]], a second band they had formed in the early 1980s. In 2004, Siouxsie began a solo career.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation (1976\u20131977) ===\nSiouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin met at a [[Roxy Music]] concert in September 1975, at a time when [[glam rock]] had faded and there was nothing new coming through with which they could identify.{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=27}} From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the [[Sex Pistols]].{{sfn|Johns|1989|p=13}} Journalist [[Caroline Coon]] dubbed them the \"[[Bromley Contingent]]\", as most of them came from the [[Bromley]] area in south east [[London]], a label Severin came to despise. \"There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked\".{{sfn|Johns|1989|p=13}} They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude.{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=48}} When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the [[100 Club Punk Festival]], organised by Sex Pistols manager [[Malcolm McLaren]], was pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members.{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=49}} Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, [[Marco Pirroni]] on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as [[Sid Vicious]]) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on \"[[The Lord's Prayer]]\".{{sfn|Paytress|2003|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nThe band intended to split up after the gig, but they were asked to play again. Over the next few months, Siouxsie and Severin recruited drummer [[Kenny Morris (musician)|Kenny Morris]] and guitarist Peter Fenton.{{sfn|Paytress|2003|pp=54\u201355}} After playing several gigs in early 1977, they realised that Fenton did not fit in because he was \"a real rock guitarist\". [[John McKay (musician)|John McKay]] took his place in July.{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=57}} Their first live appearance on television took place in November on [[Manchester]]'s  [[ITV Granada|Granada]], on [[Tony Wilson]]'s TV show ''[[So It Goes (TV series)|So It Goes]]''. That month they also recorded their first [[John Peel]] session for BBC radio in which they premiered a new song \"Metal Postcard\", introducing a \"[[motorik]] austerity\" in the drums patterns,<ref>{{citation |first=Dan |last=Cairns|title=I didn't get permission - I just went ahead and did it |work=The Sunday Times|date=26 August 2007}}</ref> with \"the space in the sound\" and \"the serrated guitars\".<ref>{{cite journal|first=David |last=Stubbs|title= Siouxsie and the Banshees ''At the BBC'' [review] |journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=July 2009|quote=the very first group to make the transition from punk's stage invasion to the more developed theatre of post-punk.

[[Nick Kent]] of ''NME'' said of the record: \"The band sounds like some unique hybrid of [[the Velvet Underground]] mated with much of the ingenuity of ''[[Tago Mago]]''-era [[Can (band)|Can]], if any parallel can be drawn\".

Their third album, ''[[Kaleidoscope (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Kaleidoscope]]'', released in 1980, saw the Banshees exploring new musical territories with the use of other instruments like synthesizers, sitars and drum machines. The group initially had a concept of making each song sound completely different, without regard to whether or not the material could be performed in concert.{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=101}} ''Melody Maker'' described the result as \"a kaleidoscope of sound and imagery, new forms, and content, flashing before our eyes\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paulo Hewitt |title=Siouxsie's sketches |journal=Melody Maker |issue=26 July 1980}}</ref> ''Kaleidoscope'' was a commercial success, peaking at number 5 in the UK albums chart.

'I heard it for the first time, and it sounded like nothing else on this planet. This is just a pop song that they put out in the middle of their career that nobody knows about, but to me it sounded like the most current but most futuristic bit of guitar-pop music I've heard.
