Their classic lineup consisted of two sets of brothers, the Mothersbaughs ([[Mark Mothersbaugh|Mark]] and [[Bob Mothersbaugh|Bob]]) and the Casales ([[Gerald Casale|Gerald]] and [[Bob Casale|Bob]]), along with [[Alan Myers (drummer)|Alan Myers]]. The band had a No. 14 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' chart]] hit in 1980 with the single \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\", the song that gave the band mainstream popularity.\n\nDevo's music and visual presentation (including stage shows and costumes) mingle [[kitsch]] science fiction themes, [[deadpan]] [[Surreal humour|surrealist humor]] and mordantly [[satire|satirical]] [[social commentary]]. The band's namesake, the [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[social theory]] of \"de-evolution\", was an integral concept in their early work, which was marked by experimental and dissonant [[art punk]] that merged rock music with [[electronic music|electronics]]. Their output in the 1980s embraced [[synth-pop]] and a more mainstream, less conceptual style, though the band's satirical and quirky humor remained intact. Their music has proven influential on subsequent movements, particularly on [[New wave music|new wave]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[alternative rock]] artists. Devo (most enthusiastically Gerald Casale) was also a pioneer of the [[music video]] format.\n\n==History==\n===1973\u20131978: Formation===\nThe name ''Devo'' comes from the concept of \"[[Devolution (biology)|de-evolution]]\" and the band's related idea that instead of continuing to evolve, mankind had begun to regress, as evidenced by the dysfunction and [[herd mentality]] of American society.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.clubdevo.com/mp/bio.html |title=Devo Bio |website=Clubdevo.com |access-date=September 11, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011183248/http://clubdevo.com/mp/bio.html |archive-date=October 11, 2007}}</ref> In the late 1960s, this idea was developed as a joke by [[Kent State University]] art students [[Gerald Casale]] and [[Bob Lewis (musician)|Bob Lewis]], who created a number of satirical art pieces in a devolution vein. At this time, Casale had also performed with the local band 15-60-75 ([[The Numbers Band]]). They met [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] around 1970, a talented keyboardist who had been playing with the band Flossy Bobbitt.<ref name=thoughts /> Mothersbaugh brought a more humorous feel to the band, introducing them to material like the pamphlet \"Jocko Homo Heavenbound\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fw_alden.tripod.com/id1.html |title=Jocko-Homo Heavenbound |website=F.

Devo returned to perform in the Student Governance Center (featured prominently in the film) at the 1974 Creative Arts Festival with a lineup including the Casale brothers, Bob Lewis, Mark Mothersbaugh, and [[Jim Mothersbaugh]] on drums.\n[[File:Devo Jocko Homo Mongoloid.jpg|thumb|right|Front and back covers of Devo's first release, the [[Phonograph record|45&nbsp;rpm]] [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Mongoloid (song)|Mongoloid]]\" backed with \"[[Jocko Homo]]\" (1977), released on the band's [[Booji Boy#Booji Boy Records|Booji Boy Records]]]]\n\nThe band continued to perform, generally as a quartet, but with a fluid lineup including Mark's brothers [[Bob Mothersbaugh]] and Jim Mothersbaugh. Bob played electric guitar, and Jim provided percussion using a set of home-made [[electronic drum]]s. Their first two music videos, \"[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]\" and \"Jocko Homo\" featured on ''[[The Truth About De-Evolution]]'', were filmed in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], and [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio]], the hometown of most members. This lineup of Devo lasted until late 1975 when Jim left the band. Bob Lewis would sometimes play guitar during this period, but mainly stayed in a managerial role. In concert, Devo would often perform in the guise of [[Characters in Devo music videos|theatrical characters]], such as [[Booji Boy]] and the Chinaman. Live concerts from this period were often confrontational, and would remain so until 1977. A recording of an early Devo performance from 1975 with the quartet lineup appears on ''[[Devo Live: The Mongoloid Years]]'', ending with the promoters unplugging Devo's equipment.<ref name=bio />\n\nFollowing Jim Mothersbaugh's departure, Bob Mothersbaugh found a new drummer, [[Alan Myers (drummer)|Alan Myers]], who played on a conventional, acoustic [[drum kit]]. Casale re-recruited his brother Bob Casale, and the lineup of Devo remained the same for nearly ten years.\n\nDevo gained some fame in 1976 when the short film ''[[The Truth About De-Evolution]]'' directed by Chuck Statler<ref>Liner notes to Devo, \"Mongoloid\" backed with \"Jocko Homo\".

After Bowie backed out of the business deal due to previous commitments, their first album, ''[[Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!|Q: Are We Not Men?

While not as successful as their first album, it did produce some fan favorites with the songs \"Blockhead\" and \"The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize\" {{sic}}, as well as a cover of the [[Johnny Rivers]] hit \"[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]\". \"Secret Agent Man\" had been recorded first in 1974 for Devo's first film and performed live as early as 1976. In 1979, Devo traveled to Japan for the first time, and a live show from this tour was partially recorded. Devo appeared on ''[[Don Kirshner's Rock Concert]]'' in 1979, performing \"Blockhead\", \"Secret Agent Man\", \"Uncontrollable Urge\", and \"Mongoloid\". Also in 1979, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]], in conjunction with the Los Angeles radio station [[KROQ-FM]], released ''Devotees'', a tribute album. It contained a set of covers of Devo songs interspersed with renditions of popular songs in Devo's style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-KROQ-Devotees-Album/release/1570542 |title=KROQ Devotees Album: RNSP 301 |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDevo actively embraced the parody religion [[Church of the SubGenius]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westword.com/music/devos-gerald-casale-were-the-predators-that-nobody-can-stop-5113527 |title=Devo's Gerald Casale: \"We're the predators that nobody can stop\" |last=Murphy |first=Tom |date=July 26, 2011 |access-date=August 13, 2015}}</ref> In concert, Devo sometimes performed as their own opening act, pretending to be a [[Christian rock|Christian soft rock]] band called \"Dove (the Band of Love)\", which is an [[anagram]] of \"Devo\".

This album included their best-known hit, \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\", which quickly became a [[Top 40]] hit. The album moved to an almost completely electronic sound, with the exception of acoustic drums and Bob Mothersbaugh's guitar. The tour for ''Freedom of Choice'' was ambitious for the band, including dates in Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huboon.com/1980.html |first=Mike |last=Ziegler |title=Devo Live Guide 1980 |website=Huboon.com |access-date=August 13, 2015}}</ref> The band used a minimalist set including large custom light boxes which could be laid on their back to form a second, smaller stage during the second half of the set. Other popular songs from ''Freedom of Choice'' were \"[[Girl U Want]]\", the [[Freedom of Choice (song)|title-track]], and \"Gates of Steel\". The band released popular music videos for \"Whip It\" and \"Girl U Want\". Devo made two appearances on the TV show ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' in 1980, as well as on ''Don Kirshner's Rock Concert'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', and other shows. The band members often wore red, terraced [[energy dome]] hats as part of its stage outfit. The dome was first worn during the band's ''Freedom of Choice'' campaign of 1980. It reappeared in the 1981, 1982, and 1988 tours, as well as in most of their performances since 1997. Devo also recorded two albums of their own songs as elevator music for their fan club, Club Devo, released on cassette in 1981 and 1984. These were later re-released on the album ''[[E-Z Listening Disc]]'' (1987), with all but two of the original Club Devo songs. These songs were often played as house music before Devo concerts.\n\nIn August 1981, the band's ''[[DEV-O Live]]'' EP spent [[List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1980s#1981 (Kent Music Report)|three weeks at the top of the Australian charts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianmusichistory.com/australian-singles-chart-for-1981 |title=Australian Singles chart for 1981 |date=November 5, 2010 |first=Mark |last=Gibson |website=Australian Music History |access-date=August 13, 2015}}</ref> In 1982, they toured Australia and appeared on the TV show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''. Devo enjoyed continued popularity in Australia, where the nationally broadcast 1970s\u20131980s pop TV show ''Countdown'' was one of the first programs in the world to broadcast their video clips. They were given consistent radio support by Sydney-based non-commercial rock station [[Triple J|Double Jay]] (2JJ) and Brisbane-based independent community station Triple Zed ([[4ZZZ]]), two of the first rock stations outside America to play their recordings. The late-night music program ''Nightmoves'' aired ''The Truth About De-Evolution''.\n\nIn 1981, Devo contributed a cover of \"[[Working in the Coal Mine]]\", recorded during the ''Freedom of Choice'' sessions, to the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]''. They offered the song to be used in the film when Warner Bros. refused to include it on the album. Warner then included it as an independent bonus single accompanying their 1981 release, ''[[New Traditionalists]]''. For this album Devo wore self-described \"Utopian Boy Scout uniforms\" topped with a \"New Traditionalist Pomp\"\u2014a plastic half-wig modeled on the hairstyle of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Among the singles from the album was \"[[Through Being Cool (Devo song)|Through Being Cool]]\", written as a reaction to their new-found fame from \"Whip It\" and seen as a response to new fans who had misinterpreted the message behind the hit song. The album's accompanying tour featured the band performing an intensely physical show with treadmills and a large Greek temple set. That same year they served as [[Toni Basil]]'s backing band on [[Word of Mouth (Toni Basil album)|''Word of Mouth'']], her debut album, which included versions of three Devo songs, recorded with Basil singing lead.<ref name=\"Top One Hit Wonders: Mickey\">{{cite web |title=Mickey \u2013 Toni Basil |url=http://toponehitwonders.com/pop/mickey-toni-basil/ |website=Top One Hit Wonders |access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Gruber: Mickey\">{{cite web |last=Gruber |first=Xaque |title='Mickey' Turns 30: A Closer Look at the One and Only Toni Basil |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/xaque-gruber/toni-basil-mickey-anniversary_b_2080971.html |website=The Huffington Post |date=November 8, 2012 |access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1982\u20131987: ''Oh, No!

Produced by [[Roy Thomas Baker]], the album featured a more synth-pop-oriented sound than its predecessors. According to Gerald Casale, the album's sound was inspired by reviewers alternately describing them as both \"[[Fascism|fascists]]\" and \"[[clown]]s\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-11426-lsdevo-is-like-the-house-band-on-the-titanicrs.html |title=Devo Is Like the House Band on the Titanic |first=Alan |last=Sculley |date=June 30, 2010 |newspaper=[[Shepherd Express]] |access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> The album's tour featured the band performing seven songs in front of a 12-foot high rear-projection screen with synchronized video, an image recreated using [[Chroma key|blue screen]] effects in the album's accompanying music videos. Devo also contributed two songs, \"[[Theme from Doctor Detroit]]\" and \"Luv-Luv\" to the 1983 [[Dan Aykroyd]] film ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'', and produced a music video for \"Theme from Doctor Detroit\" featuring clips from the film with live-action segments.\n\nDevo released their sixth album, ''[[Shout (Devo album)|Shout]]'', in 1984 to poor reviews. The album has been criticized for its overuse of the [[Fairlight CMI]] digital [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]] synthesizer and weak songwriting. However, the band's cover of the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song \"[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]\" and the accompanying music video received some praise. Following the critical and commercial failure of ''Shout'', Warner Bros. dropped Devo from their label. Shortly after, claiming to feel creatively unfulfilled, Alan Myers left the band,<ref name=Myers /> causing the remaining band members to abandon the plans for a ''Shout'' video LP, as well as a tour. In the interim, Mark Mothersbaugh began composing music for the TV show ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' and released an elaborately packaged solo [[Compact Cassette|cassette]], ''[[Muzik for Insomniaks, Volume 1 and Volume 2|Musik for Insomniaks]]'', which was later expanded and released as two [[Compact disc|CD]]s in 1988.\n\n===1987\u20131991: ''Total Devo'', ''Smooth Noodle Maps'', and breakup===\nIn 1987, Devo re-formed with former [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] drummer [[David Kendrick]] to replace Myers. Their first project was a soundtrack for the flop horror film ''[[Slaughterhouse Rock]]'', starring [[Toni Basil]]. The band released the album ''[[Total Devo]]'' in 1988, on [[Enigma Records]]. This album included two songs used in the ''Slaughterhouse Rock'' soundtrack. The song \"Baby Doll\" was used that same year in the comedy film ''[[Tapeheads]]'', with newly recorded Swedish lyrics, and was credited to (and shown in a music video by) a fictitious Swedish band called Cube-Squared. Devo followed this up with a world tour, and released the live album ''[[Now It Can Be Told: Devo at the Palace]]''.

A promotional video was filmed for the song \"Trilobites\".\n\nIn 1990, ''[[Smooth Noodle Maps]]'', Devo's last album for twenty years, was released. It too was a critical and commercial failure which, along with its two singles \"Stuck in a Loop\" and \"Post Post-Modern Man\", were Devo's worst-selling efforts; all failed to appear on the U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/smooth-noodle-maps-mw0000689854 |title=Devo: Smooth Noodle Maps |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 13, 2015}}</ref> Devo launched a concert tour in support of the album, but poor ticket sales and the bankruptcy and dissolution of Enigma Records, which was responsible for organizing and financing the tour, caused it to be cancelled part way through. They had a falling out and played one final show in March 1991 before breaking up. In an interview with Mark Mothersbaugh from excerpts on their 1996 computer game ''[[Devo Presents Adventures of the Smart Patrol (album)|Devo Presents Adventures of the Smart Patrol]]'', \"Around '88, '89, '90 maybe, we did our last tour in Europe, and it was kind of at that point, We were watching ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' on the bus and said, 'Oh my God, that's our life.' And we just said, 'Things have to change.' So we kind of agreed from there that we wouldn't do live shows anymore.\" Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', except for Bob Mothersbaugh. Two albums of demo recordings from 1974\u20131977, namely ''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume One]]'' (1990) and ''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume Two]]'' (1991), were released on [[Rykodisc]], as well as an album of early live recordings, ''[[Devo Live: The Mongoloid Years]]''.\n\n===1991\u20131996: Hiatus===\nFollowing the split, Mark Mothersbaugh established [[Mutato Muzika]], a commercial music production studio, along with Bob Mothersbaugh and Bob Casale.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/are-you-not-devo-you-are-mutato-2151061 |title=Are you not Devo?

Mothersbaugh has had considerable success writing and producing music for television programs, including ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' and  ''[[Rugrats]]'', video games, cartoons, and films, where he worked alongside director [[Wes Anderson]]. David Kendrick also worked at Mutato for a period during the early 1990s. Gerald Casale began a career as a director of music videos and commercials, working with bands including [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Silverchair]] and the [[Foo Fighters]]. In the wake of Devo's dissolution, Bob Mothersbaugh attempted to start a solo career with The Bob I Band, recording an album that was never released.

The band performed on part of the 1996 [[Lollapalooza]] tour in the rotating Mystery Spot. On these tours and most subsequent tours, Devo performed a set-list mostly composed of material from between 1978 and 1982, ignoring their Enigma Records-era material. Also in 1996, Devo released a multimedia CD-ROM [[adventure game]], ''[[Adventures of the Smart Patrol]]'' with [[Inscape (publisher)|Inscape]]. The game was not a success, but the Lollapalooza tour was received well enough to allow Devo to return in 1997 as a headliner. Devo performed sporadically from 1997 onwards.\n\nIn 1999, the ''[[Oh, No!
