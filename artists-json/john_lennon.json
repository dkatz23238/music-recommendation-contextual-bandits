Lennon was characterised by the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing and drawings, on film, and in interviews. His [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|songwriting partnership]] with [[Paul McCartney]] remains the most successful in history.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Newman |first1=Jason |title=It Takes Two: 10 Songwriting Duos That Rocked Music History |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467781/it-takes-two-10-songwriting-duos-that-rocked-music-history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=5 October 2017 |date=23 August 2011 |quote=By any measure, no one comes close to matching the success of The Beatles' primary songwriters.}}</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Liverpool]], Lennon became involved in the [[Skiffle#Revival in the United Kingdom|skiffle craze]] as a teenager. In 1956, he formed [[the Quarrymen]], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called \"the smart Beatle\", he was initially the group's ''de facto'' leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media by participating in numerous films, including ''[[How I Won the War]]'', and authoring ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'', both collections of [[literary nonsense|nonsense writings]] and line drawings. Starting with \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the [[anti-war movement]] and the larger [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]. In 1969, he started the [[Plastic Ono Band]] with his second wife, the multimedia artist [[Yoko Ono]], held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration [[Bed-ins for Peace]], and [[Break-up of the Beatles|quit the Beatles]] to embark on a solo career.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Lennon and Ono collaborated on many works, including a trilogy of [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] albums, several more films, his solo debut ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'', and the international top 10 singles <!-- Before adding to this list of Lennon's most significant songs, please seek consensus on the talk page first. Thank you. --> \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\", \"[[Instant Karma!]]\", \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" and \"[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]\". Moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the [[Vietnam War]] resulted in a three-year deportation attempt by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]]. Lennon and Ono separated from 1973 to 1975, during which time he produced [[Harry Nilsson]]'s album ''[[Pussy Cats]]''. He also had chart-topping collaborations with [[Elton John]] (\"[[Whatever Gets You thru the Night]]\") and [[David Bowie]] (\"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\"). Following a five-year hiatus, Lennon returned to music in 1980 with the Ono collaboration ''[[Double Fantasy]]''. He was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] by a Beatles fan, [[Mark David Chapman]], three weeks after the album's release.\n\nAs a performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 25 number-one singles in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. ''Double Fantasy'', his best-selling album, won the 1981 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. In 1982, Lennon won the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for [[Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music|Outstanding Contribution to Music]]. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a [[BBC]] history poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him the fifth-greatest singer and thirty-eighth [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|greatest artist]] of all time. He was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (in 1997) and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).\n\n== Early years: 1940\u20131956 ==\n[[File:Mendipsnationaltrust.JPG|thumb|alt=A grey two-storey building, with numerous windows visible on both levels|Lennon's home at [[251 Menlove Avenue]]|left]]\nLennon was born on 9 October 1940 at [[Liverpool Maternity Hospital]] to [[Julia Lennon|Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley)]] (1914\u20131958) and [[Alfred Lennon]] (1912\u20131976). Alfred was a [[Merchant Navy|merchant seaman]] of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent who was away at the time of his son's birth.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=504}} His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John \"Jack\" Lennon, and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: \"Julia offered the name in honour of&nbsp;... Winston Churchill\"}} His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9{{nbsp}}Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother;{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: \"The entire Stanley clan gathered nightly at Newcastle Road\"}} the cheques stopped when he went [[AWOL|absent without leave]] in February 1944.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=54: \"Until then he had sent her money each month from his wages, but now it stopped\"}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=26: \"In February 1944&nbsp;... he was arrested and imprisoned. Freddie subsequently disappeared for six months\"}} When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia, by then pregnant with another man's child, rejected the idea.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=27}} After her sister [[Mimi Smith|Mimi]] complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon.\n\nIn July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to [[Blackpool]], secretly intending to emigrate to [[New Zealand]] with him.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Alf admitted to her that he had planned to take John to live in New Zealand\"}} Julia followed them \u2013 with her partner at the time, Bobby Dykins \u2013 and after a heated argument, his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. In one account of this incident, Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=30: \"Julia went out of the door&nbsp;... John ran after her\"}} According to author [[Mark Lewisohn]], however, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. Billy Hall, who witnessed the incident, has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=41\u201342}} Lennon had no further contact with Alf for close to 20 years.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=497}}\n\nThroughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence, Lennon lived at [[251 Menlove Avenue|Mendips, 251{{nbsp}}Menlove Avenue]], [[Woolton]], with Mimi and her husband [[George Toogood Smith]], who had no children of their own.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Hard to see why Mimi wanted John, as she had always said she didn't want children\"}} His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving {{linktext|crossword}} puzzles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=32: \"When he was old enough, taught John how to solve crossword puzzles\"}} Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and John often visited her at 1&nbsp;Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him [[Elvis Presley]] records, taught him the banjo, and showed him how to play \"[[Ain't That a Shame]]\" by [[Fats Domino]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=48: \"To get them started, she applied the triad to 'Ain't That a Shame'\"}} In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature:\n\n{{blockquote|A part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and ''not'' be this loudmouthed lunatic poet/musician.

Five ''strong'', ''intelligent'', ''beautiful'' women, five sisters. One happened to be my mother. [She] just couldn't deal with life.

They would visit the [[Blackpool Tower Circus]] and see artists such as [[Dickie Valentine]], [[Arthur Askey]], [[Max Bygraves]] and [[Joe Loss]], with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]].{{sfn|Harry|2009}} After Parkes's family moved to Scotland, the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there.

The instrument was an inexpensive [[Gallotone Champion]] acoustic for which she lent her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house and not Mimi's, knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son's musical aspirations.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=45}} Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, and she hoped that he would grow bored with music, often telling him, \"The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it.\"{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=89}}\n\nOn 15 July 1958, Julia Lennon was struck and killed by a car while she was walking home after visiting the Smiths' house.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=48}} His mother's death traumatised the teenage Lennon, who, for the next two years, drank heavily and frequently got into fights, consumed by a \"blind rage\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=326}} Julia's memory would later serve as a major creative inspiration for Lennon, inspiring songs such as the 1968 Beatles song \"[[Julia (Beatles song)|Julia]]\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=327}}\n\nLennon's senior school years were marked by a shift in his behaviour.

Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by Lennon in September 1956.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=738}} By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a \"spirited set of songs\" made up of half skiffle and half [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=95}} Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the [[St Peter's Church, Woolton, Liverpool|St Peter's Church]] garden f\u00eate. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the band.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93\u201399}}\n\nMcCartney said that Aunt Mimi \"was very aware that John's friends were lower class\", and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=44}} According to McCartney's brother [[Mike McGear|Mike]], their father similarly disapproved of Lennon, declaring that Lennon would get his son \"into trouble\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=32}} McCartney's father nevertheless allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the family's front room at [[20 Forthlin Road|20{{nbsp}}Forthlin Road]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=38\u201339}}{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=47}} During this time Lennon wrote his first song, \"[[Hello Little Girl]]\", which became a UK top 10 hit for [[the Fourmost]] in 1963.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=337\u2013338}}\n\nMcCartney recommended that his friend [[George Harrison]] become the lead guitarist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=47, 50}} Lennon thought that Harrison, then 14 years old, was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played \"[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]\" for Lennon and was asked to join.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=47}} [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=64}} Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became \"The Beatles\" in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles were engaged for a 48-night [[The Beatles in Hamburg|residency in Hamburg]], in West Germany, and were desperately in need of a drummer. They asked [[Pete Best]] to join them.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=57}} Lennon's aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=53}} After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members, Lennon was introduced to [[Preludin]] while in Hamburg,{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66\u201367}} and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=57}}\n\n[[File:John Lennon (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Lennon in 1964]]\n[[Brian Epstein]] managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying \"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\"{{sfn|Frankel|2007}} McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer [[Ringo Starr]]; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold,{{sfn|Lewisohn |1988|pp=24\u201326: \"Twist and Shout, which had to be recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold\"}} which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \"[[Twist and Shout]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=376: \"He had been struggling all day to reach notes, but this was different, this hurt\"}} The Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \"We were just writing songs{{nbsp}}... pop songs with no more thought of them than that \u2013 to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon: \"He was like our own little Elvis{{nbsp}}... We all looked up to John.

Lennon was on tour when his first son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], was born in April. During their [[Royal Variety Show]] performance, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at the audience: \"For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands{{nbsp}}... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery.\"{{sfn|Shennan|2007}} After a year of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania in the UK]], the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' marked their breakthrough to international stardom.

We'll have to get married.\"{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=91}} The couple wed on 23 August at the [[Mount Pleasant, Liverpool|Mount Pleasant]] [[Register Office]] in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]] was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=493\u2013495}} Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=113}}\n\nCynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of [[LSD]], and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=496\u2013497}} When the group travelled by train to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], Wales in 1967 for the [[Maharishi Yogi]]'s Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage.{{sfn|Warner Brothers|1988}} After spending a holiday in Greece,{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=211\u2013213}} Cynthia arrived home at [[Kenwood, St. George's Hill|Kenwood]] to find Lennon sitting on the floor with Ono in [[terrycloth]] robes{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=213}} and left the house, feeling shocked and humiliated,{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=214\u2013215: \"I was in shock, [...] It was clear that they had arranged for me to find them like that and the cruelty of John's betrayal was hard to absorb\", \"I felt utterly humiliated, and longed to disappear.

A few weeks later, [[Magic Alex|Alexis Mardas]] informed Powell that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=221}} She received a letter stating that Lennon was doing so on the grounds of her adultery with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, an accusation which Powell denied.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=222: \"It was laughable. Roberto had been kind and a good friend, but I had never been unfaithful to John. It was his attempt to make himself feel better about what he was doing\"}} After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=229}} The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her \u00a3100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=305\u2013306: \"He had agreed that I should have custody of Julian\", \"He raised his offer to \u00a3100,000\"}}\n\n===Brian Epstein===\n\n[[File:Aankomst Brian Epstein (manager Beatles) op Schiphol (Grand Gala du Disque 1965), Bestanddeelnr 918-2516 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Brian Epstein]] in 1965]]\n\nThe Beatles were performing at Liverpool's [[The Cavern Club|Cavern Club]] in November 1961 when they were introduced to [[Brian Epstein]] after a midday concert. Epstein was homosexual and [[closeted]], and according to biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], one of Epstein's reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, \"Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a caf\u00e9 in [[Torremolinos]] looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=232}} Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club master of ceremonies [[Bob Wooler]] for saying \"How was your honeymoon, John?\" The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke,{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=1165, 1169}} but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=94, 119\u2013120}} Lennon was drunk at the time and the matter was simple: \"He called me a [[queer]] so I battered his bloody ribs in.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=1169}}\n\nLennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=232}} When Epstein invited suggestions for the title of his autobiography, Lennon offered ''Queer Jew''; on learning of the eventual title, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]'', he parodied, \"More like ''A Cellarful of Boys''\".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|pp=298\u2013299}} He demanded of a visitor to Epstein's flat, \"Have you come to blackmail him? If not, you're the only bugger in London who hasn't.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=232}} During the recording of \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\", he sang altered choruses of \"Baby, you're a rich fag Jew\".{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=503}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=206}}\n\n===Julian Lennon===\n\n[[File:Julian Lennon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Julian Lennon]] at the unveiling of the John Lennon Peace Monument]]\n\nDuring his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]] was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]]. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in [[Weybridge]] some four years later, \"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=517}} Lennon used it as the title of a [[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds|Beatles song]], and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Lennon insisted, \"It's not an acid song.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=574}} Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \"Hey Jules\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \"[[Hey Jude]]\". Lennon later said, \"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian{{nbsp}} ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=341}}\n\nLennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973.{{sfn|Pang|2008|loc=back cover}} With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to [[Disneyland]].{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=252\u2013255}} Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' track.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} He bought Julian a [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} Julian recalls that he and his father \"got on a great deal better\" during the time he spent in New York: \"We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general.\"{{sfn|Times Online|2009}}\n\nIn a ''Playboy'' interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, \"Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=63}} He said he was trying to reestablish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, \"Julian and I will have a relationship in the future.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=63}} After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.{{sfn|Badman|2003|p=393}}\n\n===Yoko Ono===\n<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. -->\n[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Lennon and Ono in 1980 by [[Jack Mitchell (photographer)|Jack Mitchell]]]]\nLennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=682}} Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \"Hammer A Nail\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\" According to Lennon's recollection in 1980, Ono had not heard of the Beatles, but she relented on condition that Lennon pay her five [[wikt:shilling|shillings]], to which Lennon said he replied, \"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=104}} Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work ''[[Apple (artwork)|Apple]]'', much to her fury.<ref name='MOMA'>{{cite web|title=Apple.

When asked, Lennon gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to \"[[The Word (song)|The Word]]\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=272}}}}\n\nOno began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \"avant-garde bullshit\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=683}} While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the ''[[Two Virgins]]'' album, after which, he said, they \"made love at dawn\".<ref>''[[Two Virgins]]'' liner notes</ref> When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \"Oh, hi.\"{{sfn|Lennon|1978|p=183}} Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=510}} a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=800}}\n\nTwo years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the [[Vietnam War]]. They were married in [[Gibraltar]] on 20 March 1969,{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=705}} and spent their honeymoon at the [[Hilton Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry,{{sfn|Kruse|2009|p=16}} so held one instead at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] in Montreal, where they recorded \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=276}} They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their \"[[Bagism]]\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song \"[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]\".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=550}} Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on 22 April 1969, adding \"Ono\" as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the [[Apple Corps]] building, where the Beatles had performed [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|their rooftop concert]] three months earlier. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, some official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon.{{sfn|Coleman|1984b|p=64}} The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire|Sunninghill]] in [[Berkshire]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=615 et seq}} After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\nOno and Lennon moved to New York, to a flat on [[Bank Street (Manhattan)|Bank Street]], [[Greenwich Village]].

Klein hired [[May Pang]] as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \"He likes you a lot.\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \"[[May Pang#\"Lost Weekend\"|lost weekend]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=698\u2013699}} In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie [[Mal Evans]], and [[Harry Nilsson]].\n\nIn June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\n===Sean Lennon===\n[[File:Sean Lennon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|right|[[Sean Lennon]] at a [[Free Tibet]] event in 1998]]\nOno had previously suffered three [[miscarriage]]s in her attempt to have a child with Lennon.

He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as ''Real Love: The Drawings for Sean''. Lennon later proudly declared, \"He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=535}}\n\n===Former Beatles===\n{{Further|Collaborations between ex-Beatles|Paul McCartney|George Harrison|Ringo Starr}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white picture of four young men outdoors in front of a staircase, surrounded by a large assembled crowd.

He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon eventually signed the papers while he was on holiday in Florida with Pang and Julian.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}}} Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him.{{sfn|Doggett|2010|pp=247\u201348}}{{sfn|The Editors of ''Rolling Stone''|2002|p=146}} Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that Lennon felt made little mention of him.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=121}} Lennon told ''[[Playboy]]'', \"I was hurt by it.

I'm not in the book.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=327}}\n\nLennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \"[[How Do You Sleep?

The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=934\u2013935}} According to Lennon, the pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but they were too tired.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp=81\u201382}} Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with{{nbsp}}... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono{{nbsp}}... That ain't bad picking.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2010\u20132011|p=95}}\n\nAlong with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music. During his career break from 1975 until shortly before his death, according to Fred Seaman, Lennon and Ono's assistant at the time, Lennon was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} Lennon took notice when McCartney released \"[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]\" in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio. \"It's driving me crackers!\" he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time.

It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages.{{sfn|Friedman|2005|p=252}} The ACLU, representing Wiener, won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] in 1991.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=315}} The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] appealed the decision to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52\u201354, 76}} In 1997, respecting President [[Bill Clinton]]'s newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve \"foreseeable harm\", the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52\u201354, 76}}\n\nWiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000.

He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the ''Daily Howl''. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the ''Daily Howl'' to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate [[Pete Shotton]], to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon \"had an obsession for [[Wigan Pier]]. It kept cropping up\", and in Lennon's story ''A Carrot in a Potato Mine'', \"the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier.\" Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, \"Why?\" Above was a flying pancake, and below, \"a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog \u2013 also wearing glasses\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=179\u2013181}}\n\nLennon's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that ''[[In His Own Write]]'' (1964) was published after \"Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about\". Like the ''Daily Howl'' it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, \"Good Dog Nigel\", tells the tale of \"a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail \u2013 until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock\". ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' considered the poems and stories \"remarkable&nbsp;... also very funny&nbsp;... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy\". ''Book Week'' reported, \"This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the [[Literary nonsense|literature of nonsense]] to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge.\" Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers \"took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=393\u2013394}}\n\nIn combination with ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'' (1965), ''In His Own Write'' formed the basis of the stage play ''[[The Lennon Play: In His Own Write]]'',{{sfn|Lewisohn|2000|p=287}} co-adapted by [[Victor Spinetti]] and [[Adrienne Kennedy]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=396\u2013397}} After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]], the play opened at [[The Old Vic]] in 1968.

''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' (2000) also presented examples of his writings and drawings.\n\n==Art==\nIn 1967, Lennon, who had attended art school, funded and anonymously participated in Ono's art exhibition [[Half-A-Room]] that was held at [[Lisson Gallery]]. Following his collaborating with Ono in the form of The [[Plastic Ono Band]] that began in 1968, Lennon became involved with the [[Fluxus]] art movement.

''Blue Room Event'' consisted of sentences that Ono wrote directly on her white New York apartment walls and ceiling.

The cut-up technique can be traced to at least the [[Dada]]ists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the early 1960s by writer [[William S. Burroughs]]. For ''The Complete Yoko Ono Word Poem Game'', Lennon took the portrait photo of himself that was included in the packaging of the 1968 ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' LP (aka ''The White Album'') and cut it into 134 small rectangles. A single word was written on the back of each fragment, to be read in any order. The portrait image was meant to be reassembled in any order.

Lennon said, \"I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming.\"{{sfn|Wenner|2000|p=14}} In the words of biographer Barry Miles, \"Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock 'n' roll.\"{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=90}} The Beatles' producer, [[George Martin]], tells how Lennon \"had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand.
