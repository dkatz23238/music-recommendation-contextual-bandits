She rose to fame after winning the [[American Idol (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2002, which earned her a record deal with [[RCA Records|RCA]]. Her debut single, \"[[A Moment Like This]]\", topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and became the country's best selling single of 2002. It was included on her debut studio album, ''[[Thankful (Kelly Clarkson album)|Thankful]]'' (2003), which debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Trying to reinvent her image, Clarkson parted ways with ''Idol'' management and shifted to [[pop rock]] for her second studio album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]'' (2004). Supported by four US top-ten singles \u2013 [[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|the title track]], \"[[Since U Been Gone]]\", \"[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]\", and \"[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]\" \u2013 ''Breakaway'' sold over 12 million copies worldwide and won two [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nClarkson took further creative control for her third studio album, ''[[My December]]'' (2007), co-writing all of its tracks and becoming its executive producer.
