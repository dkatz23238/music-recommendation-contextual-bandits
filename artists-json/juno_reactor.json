Central to the project is Ben Watkins and his collaborations with a constantly changing ensemble of musicians from across the world. This ensemble has included [[Mabi Thobejane]], [[Amampondo]], [[Steve Stevens]], [[Eduardo Niebla]], [[Greg Ellis (musician)|Greg Ellis]], [[Taz Alexander]], [[Sugizo]], [[Budgie (drummer)|Budgie]] and recently [[Hamsika Iyer]] and [[Maggie Hikri]].\n\n==History==\nJuno Reactor was formed as an art project in 1990. [[Ben Watkins]] wanted to collaborate with other artists, producing exciting projects that were not commercially driven. He wanted to create experimental music and non-musical soundtracks that would work with installations, art pieces, and film projects.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.popmatters.com/juno-reactor-gods-and-monsters-2496154982.html|title=Juno Reactor: Gods and Monsters|date=2008-05-07|work=PopMatters|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/juno-reactor-mn0000305109/biography|title=Juno Reactor {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>\n\nJuno Reactor released their first single, \"Laughing Gas\", in 1993 on the [[NovaMute]] label. This was soon followed by their debut album, ''[[Transmissions (Juno Reactor album)|Transmissions]]''. This release was the first artist album in the genre{{clarify |date=March 2019 |reason=which genre? }}. Later, the band released ''[[Luciana (album)|Luciana]]'' on [[Alex Paterson]]'s ([[The Orb]]) [[Inter-Modo]] label. Juno Reactor left [[NovaMute]] and [[Inter-Modo]] in 1995 and signed with the [[United Kingdom|UK]] label [[Blue Room Released]] to release the single \"Guardian Angel\". Their album ''[[Beyond the Infinite]]'' was released in 1995.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe 1997 [[Blue Room Released]] ''[[Bible of Dreams]]'' was Juno Reactor's fourth album. It had a very different sound from the group's previous albums, and moved away from the traditional dance beats by implementing tribal influences. Watkins collaborated with [[Amampondo]], a traditional [[South Africa]]n percussion act, on the single \"Conga Fury\". Watkins and Amampondo went on a five-week tour of the US, opening for [[Moby]]. In 1998, Juno Reactor played a live set with Amampondo at [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The group collaborated with [[The Creatures]] on the track \"I'm here...Another Planet\" for the ''[[Lost in Space (film)|Lost in Space]]'' (1998) soundtrack.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> They teamed up with [[The Creatures]] again in 1999 on the track \"Exterminating Angel\", featured on that group's album ''[[Anima Animus]]''.<ref name=\"roughguide\"/>\n\nWatkins released the fifth Juno Reactor album, ''[[Shango (Juno Reactor album)|Shango]]'', in 2000. It was the first of his albums on [[Metropolis Records]]. The first track from the album, \"[[Pistolero (song)|Pistolero]]\", was a collaboration with [[Billy Idol]]'s guitarist, [[Steve Stevens]].

It was recorded in a Japanese studio overlooking [[Mount Fuji]]. \"Hotaka\" featured Stevens on guitar, and included traditional [[Taiko]] drummers [[Gocoo]]. In 2003, the album ''Odyssey 1992\u20132002'' was released as a compilation of the best Juno Reactor tracks of the decade.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe sixth Juno Reactor album, ''[[Labyrinth (Juno Reactor album)|Labyrinth]]'', was released in October 2004, and featured Watkins' work from the [[The Matrix series|''Matrix'' films]]. The album once again featured the tribal influences present in their music through tracks like \"Conquistador II\".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 2006, Watkins was hired to compose an orchestral score for ''[[Brave Story]]'', a Japanese [[anime]] feature film. [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Japan]] released the soundtrack, which was recorded at the [[Building of Slovak radio|Slovak Radio Concert Hall]] in [[Slovakia]] with the Slovak National Symphony Orchestra. The album was written by \"Ben Watkins aka Juno Reactor\".<ref name=\"discog-bravestory\"/>\n\nIn 2008 Ben Watkins collaborated with anime director [[Koji Morimoto]] for ''[[Genius Party Beyond]]'', an anthology of short animated films from [[Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C]].\n\nJuno Reactor's album ''[[Gods & Monsters (Juno Reactor album)|Gods & Monsters]]'' was released in March 2008, and featured the introduction of Ghetto Priest and [[Sugizo]] into the Juno Reactor fold, along with [[Eduardo Niebla]], Xavier Morel, and Yasmin Levy. In 2009, the band toured with drummer [[Budgie (drummer)|Budgie]], of the band [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].\n\nJuno Reactor's album ''[[The Golden Sun of the Great East]]'' was released on Metropolis Records in 2013.\n[[File:Agnivo.jpg|thumb|263x263px|Agnivo as part of Juno Reactor]]\n[[Juno Reactor & The Mutant Theatre]] premiered at the [[Ozora Festival]] 4 August 2016 \"TIME\" a unique performance featuring the Juno Reactor live band: [[Tal Tula Ben-Ari]] (Vocals) [[Nataly Hay]] (Dancer) [[Amir-John Haddad|Amir Haddad]] (Oud and Guitars) Ben Watkins (Electronics & Guitar) [[Johann Bley]] (Drums).
