Most prominent was [[Lin Biao]], until his purported defection from China and death in a plane crash in 1971.

Mao placed his wife Jiang Qing, a former film actress who before 1966 had not taken a public political role, in charge of the country's cultural apparatus. Zhang, Yao and Wang were party leaders in Shanghai who had played leading roles in securing that city for Mao during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAround the time of the death of Lin Biao in 1971, the Cultural Revolution began to lose momentum. The new commanders of the [[People's Liberation Army]] demanded that order be restored in light of the dangerous situation along the border with the [[Soviet Union]] (see [[Sino-Soviet split]]). Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], who had accepted the Cultural Revolution, but never fully supported it, regained his authority, and used it to bring Deng Xiaoping back into the Party leadership at the 10th Party Congress in 1973. Liu Shaoqi had meanwhile died in prison in 1969.\n\nNear the end of Mao's life, a power struggle occurred between the Gang of Four and the alliance of Deng Xiaoping, Zhou Enlai, and [[Ye Jianying]].\n\n==Downfall==\n[[Image:Gang of Four at trial.jpg|thumb|450px|The Gang of Four at their trial in 1981]]\nZhou Enlai died in January 1976, and in the subsequent months of mourning, a power struggle occurred in the top echelons of the party. The reformist Deng was named acting premier, while the Gang of Four began using their newspapers to criticize Deng and to mobilize their urban militia groups. Much of the military and party security remained under the control of the party elders of the Central Committee, who generally took a cautious role in mediating between the reformist Deng and the radical Gang of Four. They agreed to the removal of Deng from office after the April [[1976 Tiananmen Incident|Tiananmen Incident]], but took steps to ensure that Deng and his allies would not be personally harmed in the process.\n\nOn September 9, Chairman Mao died. For the next few weeks the Gang of Four retained control over the government media, and many articles appeared on the theme of \"principles laid down\" (or \"established\") by Mao near the end of his life.<ref name=hsu15>{{Citation\n| last1       = Hs\u00fc\n| first1      = Immanuel Chung-yueh\n| year       = 1990\n| title      = China Without Mao: the Search for a New Order\n| publisher  = Oxford University Press\n| isbn       = 0-19536-303-5\n| page       = 15\n}}</ref><ref name=baum>{{Citation\n| last1       = Baum\n| first1       = Richard\n| year       = 1996\n| title       = Burying Mao: Chinese Politics in the Age of Deng Xiaoping\n| publisher       = Princeton University Press\n| page       = [https://archive.org/details/buryingmao00rich/page/40 40]\n| isbn       = 0-69103-637-3\n| url-access       = registration\n| url       = https://archive.org/details/buryingmao00rich/page/40\n}}</ref> (The words \"principles laid down\" were themselves supposedly a quotation from Mao, but their canonical status was in dispute.<ref name=hsu15/>) Urban militia units commanded by supporters of the radical group were placed on a heightened state of readiness.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1       = Hs\u00fc\n| first1      = Immanuel Chung-yueh\n| year       = 1990\n| title      = China Without Mao: the Search for a New Order\n| publisher  = Oxford University Press\n| isbn       = 0-19536-303-5\n| page       = 13\n}}</ref><ref name=baum/>\n\nPremier Hua Guofeng attacked the radicals' media line at a Politburo meeting in late September;<ref name=hsu16/> but Jiang Qing emphatically disagreed with Hua, and she insisted that she be named as the new party chairman.<ref name=hsu16>{{Citation\n| last1       = Hs\u00fc\n| first1      = Immanuel Chung-yueh\n| year       = 1990\n| title      = China Without Mao: the Search for a New Order\n| publisher  = Oxford University Press\n| isbn       = 0-19536-303-5\n| page       = 16\n}}</ref> The meeting ended inconclusively.<ref name=hsu16/> On October 4 the radical group warned, via an article in the ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]'', that any revisionist who interfered with the established principles would \"come to no good end\".<ref name=baum/>\n \nThe radicals hoped that the key military leaders [[Wang Dongxing]] and [[Chen Xilian]] would support them, but instead, Hua won the Army over to his side.

That night Mao Yuanxin was arrested in [[Manchuria]], and the propagandists of the Gang of Four in [[Peking University]] and in newspaper offices were taken into custody. All was done with quiet and efficiency. In Shanghai, the Gang's supporters received a message to come to Beijing \"for a meeting\". They came and were arrested.
