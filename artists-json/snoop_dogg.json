Among the many notable hip hop industry deaths and convictions were the death of Snoop Dogg's friend and labelmate [[Tupac Shakur]] and the [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] indictment of Death Row co-founder [[Suge Knight]].<ref name=\"allmusicbio\"/> Dr. Dre had left Death Row earlier in 1996 because of a contract dispute, so Snoop Dogg co-produced ''Tha Doggfather'' with [[Daz Dillinger]] and [[DJ Pooh]].\n\nThis album featured a distinct change of style from ''Doggystyle,'' and the leadoff single, \"[[Snoop's Upside Ya Head]]\", featured a collaboration with  Charlie Wilson The album sold reasonably well but was not as successful as its predecessor. ''Tha Doggfather'' had a somewhat softer approach to the G-funk style. After Dr. Dre withdrew from Death Row Records, Snoop realized that he was subject to an ironclad time-based contract (i.e., that Death Row practically owned anything he produced for a number of years), and refused to produce anymore tracks for [[Suge Knight]] other than the insulting \"Fuck Death Row\" until his contract expired.<ref name=\"Most Lovable Pimp\"/> In an interview with [[Neil Strauss]] in 1998, Snoop Dogg said that though he had been given lavish gifts by his former label, they had withheld his royalty payments.<ref>Strauss, Neil. ''Everyone Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2011, p. 12-13</ref>\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that after ''Tha Doggfather,'' Snoop Dogg began \"moving away from his gangsta roots toward a calmer lyrical aesthetic\":<ref name=\"allmusicbio\"/> for instance, Snoop participated in the 1997 [[Lollapalooza]] concert tour, which featured mainly alternative rock music.
