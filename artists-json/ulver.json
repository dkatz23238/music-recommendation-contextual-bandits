Their early works, such as debut album ''[[Bergtatt \u2013 Et eeventyr i 5 capitler|Bergtatt]]'', were categorised as folklore-influenced [[black metal]], but the band has since evolved a fluid and increasingly eclectic musical style, blending genres such as [[experimental rock]], [[electronica]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[trip hop]], [[symphonic music|symphonic]] and [[chamber music|chamber]] traditions, [[noise music|noise]], [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[experimental music]] into their oeuvre.<ref>{{cite web|last=All Music|title=Ulver Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ulver-mn0000179632/biography|access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref> 1997 marked their international debut with the release of their third album ''[[Nattens madrigal]]'' through German label [[Century Media Records|Century Media]]. However, following discord with the label, Rygg formed his own imprint, [[Jester Records]], in 1998.<ref name=\"Discogs\">{{cite web | url=http://www.discogs.com/label/12795-Jester-Records | title=Jester Records | publisher=Discogs | access-date=27 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Rygg invited composer and multi-instrumentalist Tore Ylwizaker into the band, and together they changed Ulver's musical direction. Their first musical endeavour together, ''[[Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', drew from a variety of non-metal sources, including [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], and the works of [[William Blake]]. ''[[Metamorphosis (EP)|Metamorphosis]]'' (1999) and ''[[Perdition City]]'' (2000) followed, showcasing further experimentation and explorations into [[electronic music]]. In 2000, author [[J\u00f8rn H. Sv\u00e6ren]] joined the band, and since then, the core of Ulver has been Rygg, Ylwizaker and Sv\u00e6ren. In 2009, Ulver expanded their line-up: British multi-instrumentalist [[Daniel O'Sullivan (musician)|Daniel O'Sullivan]] became the fourth core member, and several other musicians were enlisted as supporting and live members; of the latter, Norwegian musician and producer Ole Alexander Halstensg\u00e5rd has since established himself as another prominent member of the band.\n\nUlver has performed at several prestigious venues, including [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] (2009), [[Norwegian National Opera and Ballet|the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet]] (2010), [[Teatro Regio (Parma)|Teatro Regio di Parma]] (2013), [[Franco Maria Ricci|Labirinto della Masone di Franco Maria Ricci]] (2017)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.labirintodifrancomariaricci.it/en/evento/ulver-at-labirinto-della-masone/!eyJtIjoiUDEzNDI0IiwiYyI6IlA5MDQzIn0|title=ULVER at Labirinto della Masone|website=Franco Maria Ricci|language=en-US|access-date=24 January 2020}}</ref> and held artist residency at [[Henie Onstad Kunstsenter]] (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ulver Live at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter 15.04.2018.

The concert was a part of the [[Norwegian Festival of Literature]]. The three band members were accompanied by guest musicians: Lars Pedersen (aka [[When (Pedersen)|When]]) on drums, Daniel O'Sullivan (also in \u00c6thenor, [[Guapo (band)|Guapo]], Mothlite) on guitar and bass, [[Pamelia Kurstin]] playing [[Theremin]] and Ole Aleksander Halstensg\u00e5rd (from [[Paperboys (group)|Paperboys]]).\n\nSubsequently, the only live appearances outside Norway were held at the Brutal Assault Festival in the Czech Republic on 7 August and at the Gagarin205 club in Athens, Greece (16 November). More festival appearances in Norway were announced: ''[[\u00d8yafestivalen]]'' at Middelalderparken, Oslo (11 August), ''M\u00f8llafestivalen'' in Gjerstad (14 August), ''Pstereo '09'' at Marinen, Trondheim (21 August) and London's Queen Elizabeth Hall (9 October).\n\n===Ulver at the Opera===\nOn 31 July 2010 Ulver performed live at the [[Norwegian National Opera and Ballet]] with [[Christian Fennesz]] and the performance artist Ian Johnstone.<ref name=\"Jester Records\">{{cite web|author=ULVER |url=http://www.jester-records.com/ulver/ulver.html |title=Ulver Official Homepage |website=Jester-records.com |date=31 August 1997 |access-date=27 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''Wars of the Roses'' Tour===\nFrom 22 March 2011 to 21 April, Ulver played in several European countries to support their 2011 album ''Wars of the Roses''. On this tour they performed said album in its entirety, and also added some abstract/improvised passages. [[Zweizz]] supported these shows.\n\n===''Messe I.X\u2013VI.X'' performances===\nFollowing its original performance at Troms\u00f8 Kulturhus in Troms\u00f8, Norway, with Troms\u00f8 Chamber Orchestra, on 21 September 2012, Ulver have performed ''Messe I.X\u2013VI.X'' in its entirety a further three times: On 20 May 2013 at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]], Leipzig, Germany with the St\u00fcba Philharmonie, Volkspalast and on 16 November 2013 at Teatro Regio, Parma, Italy with the MG_INC Orchestra and at the Dark MOFO festival, 17 June 2017, in Hobart, Australia, the orchestras being conducted by composer [[Martin Romberg]].\n\n===''The Assassination of Julius Caesar'' performances===\nIn the wake of the release of ''The Assassination of Julius Caesar'', Ulver played a few concerts in Europe, and gave their first two shows in Australia. In November, they toured Europe, playing their last album in its entirety, only adding a few songs from their ''Sic Transit Gloria Mundi'' EP released shortly before the beginning of the tour. [[Stian Westerhus]] was their opening act, promoting its solo album Amputation, and supporting Ulver on stage as a guitarist during some songs he played on the last Ulver's release.\n\n===First North American performances===\nOn 21 and 22 March 2019, Ulver played at Irving Plaza in New York City, their first North American shows ever. It was described by ''Kerrang!'' as \"New York's ultimate goth night\". A return to the United States was cancelled when Ulver announced that pre-sale tickets were \"too modest\" up against the \"big risk\" of touring with their production in the US.<ref name=\"Brooklyn vegan\">{{cite web|author=Hatfield, Amanda |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/ulver-cancel-west-coast-tour-say-presales-are-too-modest/ |title=Ulver cancel West Coast tour, say \"pre-sales are too modest\" |website=brooklynvegan.com|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Current members===\n* [[Kristoffer Rygg]] \u2013 vocals, additional [[programming (music)|programming]], e-percussion {{small|(1993\u2013present)}}\n* Tore Ylwizaker \u2013 programming, keyboards {{small|(1998\u2013present)}}\n* J\u00f8rn H.
