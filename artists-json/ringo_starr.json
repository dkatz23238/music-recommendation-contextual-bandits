Starr occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\" and \"[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles songs \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\" and \"[[Octopus's Garden]]\", and is credited as a co-writer of four others.\n\nStarr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, with periods of prolonged hospitalisation. He briefly held a position with [[British Rail]] before securing an apprenticeship as a machinist at a Liverpool school equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, Starr became interested in the UK [[skiffle]] craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American [[rock and roll]] around early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another [[Liverpool]] group, [[Rory Storm#Rory Storm and the Hurricanes|Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]]. After achieving moderate success in the UK and [[Hamburg]], he quit the Hurricanes when he was asked to join the Beatles in August 1962, replacing [[Pete Best]].\n\nIn addition to [[The Beatles in film|the Beatles' films]], Starr has acted in numerous others. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US top-ten hit \"[[It Don't Come Easy]]\", and number ones \"[[Photograph (Ringo Starr song)|Photograph]]\" and \"[[You're Sixteen]]\". His most successful UK single was \"[[Back Off Boogaloo]]\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]'', which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. Starr has featured in numerous documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two series of the children's television program ''[[Thomas & Friends]]'' and portrayed \"Mr. Conductor\" during the first season of the [[PBS]] children's television series ''[[Shining Time Station]]''. Since 1989, he has toured with thirteen variations of [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]].\n\nStarr's playing style, which emphasised feel over technical virtuosity, influenced many drummers to reconsider their playing from a compositional perspective. He also influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the [[matched grip]], tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings.<ref name=\"PAS\" /> In his opinion, his finest recorded performance was on the Beatles' \"[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=280}} In 1999, he was inducted into the ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.moderndrummer.com/modern-drummers-readers-poll-archive/#_ | title= Modern Drummer's Readers Poll Archive, 1979\u20132014 | work=[[Modern Drummer]] | access-date=10 August 2015}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' readers named him the fifth-greatest drummer of all time.
