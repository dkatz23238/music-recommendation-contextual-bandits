He is known for his musical versatility, as his [[Ricky Martin albums discography|discography]] spans multiple genres, including [[Latin pop]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Dance music|dance]], [[reggaeton]], and [[Salsa music|salsa]].<!-- Sourced in \"Musical styles and themes\" section --> Dubbed the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#M|King of Latin Pop]]\", the \"King of Latin Music\", and the \"Latin Pop God\", he is regarded as one of the most influential artists in the world.<!-- Sourced in \"Legacy and influence\" section --> Born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], Martin began appearing in television commercials at the age of 9 and began his musical career at age 12, as a member of Puerto Rican boy band [[Menudo (group)|Menudo]]. He started his solo career in 1991 while in [[Sony Music Mexico]], gaining recognition in Latin America with the release of his first two studio albums, ''[[Ricky Martin (1991 album)|Ricky Martin]]'' (1991) and ''[[Me Amaras (album)|Me Amaras]]'' (1993), both of which were focused on [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]].\n\nMartin's third album, ''[[A Medio Vivir]]'' (1995), helped him rise to prominence in European countries. The chart-topping single \"[[Mar\u00eda (Ricky Martin song)|Mar\u00eda]]\", incorporated a mixture of [[Latin music]] genres and became his first international hit. His international success was further solidified with his fourth album, ''[[Vuelve (album)|Vuelve]]'' (1998). The album, which earned Martin his first [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]], spawned chart-topping hits \"[[Vuelve (Ricky Martin song)|Vuelve]]\" and \"[[The Cup of Life|La Copa de la Vida]]\".

As an actor, Martin gained popularity and stardom for his role in the hit [[soap opera]] ''[[General Hospital]]'' (1994-1996), while his portrayal of [[Antonio D'Amico]] in ''[[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story]]'' (2018) marked the acting opportunity of his career, garnering him an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] nomination.

A month after joining Menudo, he made his debut performance with the group at the [[Luis A. Ferr\u00e9 Performing Arts Center]] in San Juan. During this performance, he inadvertently disobeyed the choreography by walking around the stage, when it was planned that he would stay still, and was chastised by the band manager after the show: \"The mistake was such a big deal that from that moment on, never again did I move when I wasn't supposed to move. That was the discipline of Menudo: You either did things the way you were told or you were not part of the group.\" Although Martin enjoyed traveling and performing onstage with Menudo, he found the band's busy schedule and strict management exhausting, and later reflected that the experience \"cost\" him his childhood. Despite this, Martin acknowledged his \"opportunity to have so many amazing experiences with so many amazing people\" during his time with the group.<ref name=\"rickybook\"/>\n\nDuring his time with

As he understood they did this because they loved him and wanted the best for him, he \"forgave all of the pain and anger they caused\" him.

He accepted the offer, dropped out the university and moved from New York to Mexico City to perform in the play. While he was performing onstage in ''Mama Ama el Rock'', a producer in the audience took notice of Martin's acting and offered him a role in the Mexican [[telenovela]] ''[[Alcanzar una estrella]]'' ({{trans|''To reach a star''}}) (1990). Martin also joined the cast for the second season of the show, titled ''[[Alcanzar una estrella II]]'' (1991). A film based on the TV series, titled ''M\u00e1s que alcanzar una estrella'' ({{trans|''More than reaching for a star''}}) (1992), was also produced in which Martin starred, and earned him an [[El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico|El Heraldo Award]] for his role.<ref name=\"rickybook\"/>\n\n{{Quote box |bgcolor=#bbccff |salign=right |width=240px |align=right | quote = I was so excited about getting back into the music world that I didn't care what the conditions were.

The show was canceled after two seasons, but soon afterward, Martin was given the role of Miguel Morez on the popular hit soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]''; Morez, a bartender and singer, known for his long and flowing hair, was a Puerto Rican citizen hiding in the United States from his lover's [[Crime boss|criminal mastermind]] father and created a [[love triangle]] with his fianc\u00e9 Lily Rivera and Brenda. Martin portrayed the role for two years and gained huge popularity and stardom, becoming \"one of the most-talked about actors on the soap opera\". Despite this, Martin felt he lacked chemistry with the rest of the ''General Hospital'' cast and observed that people treated him differently because of his Puerto Rican accent.
