A type of [[cutlery]] (sometimes called flatware in the United States), especially as part of a [[table setting|place setting]], it is used primarily for transferring food to the mouth. Spoons are also used in food preparation to measure, mix, stir and toss ingredients and for serving food. Present day spoons are made from metal (notably flat silver or [[Household silver|silverware]], plated or solid), wood, [[porcelain]] or plastic. There are a wide variety of spoons that are made of a variety of materials and by different cultures for many different uses and foods.\n\n==History==\nPreserved examples of various forms of spoons used by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians include those composed of [[ivory]], [[flint]], [[slate]] and wood, many of them carved with [[religious symbol]]s.<ref name=\"enc\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Spoon|volume=25|page=733}}</ref> During the Neolithic Ozieri civilization in [[Sardinia]], ceramic [[Ladle (spoon)|ladles]] and spoons were already in use.

In [[Southeast Asia]], spoons are the primary utensil used for eating; forks are used to push foods such as rice onto the spoon as well as their western usage for piercing the food.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.satayusa.com/southchina.htm|title=South China Seas Culture & Cuisine|website=www.satayusa.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://uktv.co.uk/food/item/aid/534144| title = UKTV Food: Recipes: Southeast Asian cuisine}}</ref> Use of a spoon for cutting <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tastecooking.com/spoon-over-fork/|title = Spoons: The Filipino Utensil of Choice|date = 10 May 2018}}</ref> is common in the Philippines but has resulted in disciplinary action [[Montreal-Philippines cutlery controversy|against a student doing so]] in Canada.\n\nSpoons are also widely used in cooking and serving.

A test sample of jelly taken from a boiling mass may be allowed to slip from a spoon in a sheet, in a step called \"sheeting\". At the \"crack\" stage, syrup from [[boiling]] sugar may be dripped from a spoon, causing it to break with a snap when chilled. When boiled to 240&nbsp;\u00b0F. and poured from a spoon, sugar forms a filament, or \"thread\". Hot syrup is said to \"pearl\" when it forms such a long thread without breaking when dropped from a spoon.\n\nUsed for stirring, a spoon is passed through a substance with a continued circular movement for the purpose of mixing, blending, dissolving, cooling, or preventing sticking of the ingredients. Mixed drinks may be \"[[muddler|muddled]]\" by working a spoon to crush and mix ingredients such as mint and sugar on the bottom of a glass or mixer. Spoons are employed for mixing certain kinds of powder into water to make a sweet or nutritious drink.<!--need more specifics; this is a strange sentence-->\nA spoon may also be employed to toss ingredients by mixing them lightly until they are well coated with a dressing.\n\nFor storage, spoons and knives were sometimes placed in paired ''[[decorative boxes|knife boxes]]'', which were often ornate wooden containers with sloping top, used especially during the 18th century. On the table, an ornamental utensil called a ''[[nef (napkin holder)|nef]]'', shaped like a ship, might hold a napkin, knife and spoon.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:18-03-25-K\u00fcchenutensil-DSCF1429.jpg|Spoon with special tip for kiwifruits or melons\nFile:18-03-25-K\u00fcchenutensil-DSCF1431.jpg|Spoons for salad\nFile:Spoonful of cereal.jpg|Cold [[breakfast cereal]] held in a [[dessert spoon]]\nFile:Soup Spoon.jpg|[[Stainless steel]] bouillon spoon\n</gallery>\n\n==Language and culture==\n[[File:First rice.jpg|thumb|Spoon-feeding]]\nSpoons can be [[Spoon (musical instrument)|used as a musical instrument]].\n\nTo ''spoon-feed'' oneself or another can simply mean to feed by means of a spoon. Metaphorically, however, it often means to present something to a person or group so thoroughly or wholeheartedly as to preclude the need of independent thought, initiative or self-reliance on the part of the recipient; or to present information in a slanted version, with the intent to preclude questioning or revision. Someone who accepts passively what has been offered in this way is said to have been spoon-fed.\n\nA '''spoonful'''\u2014the amount of material a spoon contains or can contain\u2014is used as a standard [[units of measurement|unit of measure]] for volume in [[Cooking weights and measures|cooking]], where it normally signifies a '''teaspoonful'''. It is abbreviated ''coch'' or ''cochl'', from Latin ''cochleare''. \"Teaspoonful\" is often used in a similar way to describe the dosage for [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter medicines]]. [[Dessert spoon]]ful and [[tablespoon]]ful may also be found in drink and food recipes. A teaspoon holds about 5ml and a tablespoon about 15 ml.\n\nThe [[souvenir spoon]] generally exists solely as a decorative object commemorating an event, place, or special date.\n\n==Manufacture==\n{{See also|Silver#Jewelry_and_silverware|l1=Alloys of silver used in jewelry and silverware}}\n\nFor machine-made spoons, the basic shape is cut out from a sheet of [[sterling silver]], nickel silver [[alloy]] or [[stainless steel]]. The bowl is cross rolled between two pressurized rollers to produce a thinner section. The handle section is also rolled to produce the width needed for the top end. The blank is then cropped to the required shape, and two dies are used to apply the pattern to the blank. The [[Flash (manufacturing)|flash]] is then removed using a [[Linishing|linish]]er, and the bowl is formed between two dies and bent.\n[[File:Forgedspoons-1-.jpg|thumb|The stages of the [[Forge|handforging]] process]]\n\nTo make a spoon the traditional by way of [[Forge|handforging]], a bar of [[silver]] is marked up to the correct proportions for the bowl and handle.\n\nIt is then heated until red hot and held in [[tongs]] and using the [[hammer]] and [[anvil]], beaten into shape. The tip of the bar is pointed to form the tip of the bowl, then hammered to form the bowl. If a heel is to be added, a section down the centre is left thicker. The edges of the bowl and the tip of the spoon are left thicker as this is where most of the thickness is needed. The handle is then started and hammered out to length going from thick at the neck and gradually tapering down in thickness giving a balanced feel. During this process, the piece becomes very hard and has to be [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]]ed several times, then worked again until the final shape is achieved.\n\n[[File:Euskal Museoa spoons.jpg|thumb|Wooden spoon carving steps]]\nThe bowl is filed to shape, often using a metal template. The bowl is then formed using a tin cake and spoon stake. The molten [[tin]] is poured around the spoon stake and left to harden. The handle is then bent down to 45 degrees, and the spoon is hammered into the tin using the spoon stake and a heavy hammer, to form the bowl. The bend in the handle is then adjusted to match the other spoons in the set and so it sits correctly on the table. The bowl is then [[file (tool)|file]]d level, a process called striking off. The surfaces are filed, first with a rough file to remove the fire stain from the surface, then with a smooth file. It is then buffed to remove any file marks and fire stain from inside the bowl and is polished to the desired finish.\n\n== Derivatives ==\nBoth the [[spork]] and the [[sporf]] are derived from the spoon: they combine the bowl of the spoon with the [[Tine (structural)|tines]] of the [[fork]] and with both tines and the cutting edge of the [[knife]] respectively.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cutlery]]\n* [[List of types of spoons]]\n* [[Spoon bending]]\n* [[Spoon theory]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Bednersh, Wayne.
