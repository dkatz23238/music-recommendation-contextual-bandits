According to an interview she gave in 2005 on British music station [[The Box (UK and Ireland)|The Box]], her voice lost its power and she became unable to record, and thus she spent a long time writing and trying to create a sound that she finally became happy with.\n\nAs stated on the Australian talk show ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove]]'' in 2004, Anastacia wanted to have more edge to her vocals as she felt there was something missing from her previous works. She brought in rock instruments that brought a new atmosphere to her music. She also felt that she still needed the funkiness and pop as the singer felt that too much edge would sound wrong with her voice. Out of this a new sound was formed. She describes her sound as Sprock\u2014a combination of [[soul music|soul]], pop, and rock. She named the album after herself. Anastacia entered record studios in September 2003 to begin recording her next album, working with [[Glen Ballard]], [[Dallas Austin]], and [[David A. Stewart]] for release in 2004. On the album, Anastacia also collaborated with [[P.O.D.]] lead singer [[Sonny Sandoval]] on the socially conscious track \"I Do\".\n\nThe first single, released in March, was \"[[Left Outside Alone]]\", which saw a change in direction for Anastacia. It was one of the biggest songs in Europe of 2004, reaching number one in Austria, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland; number two in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway; and number three in the United Kingdom and Hungary. Overall the song remained at number one on the European ''Billboard'' singles chart for 15 weeks.<ref name=\"anastacia.com\"/> The song also topped the Australian charts, Anastacia's second number one in the country, where it went on to become the second-biggest-selling single of 2004.\n\n''[[Anastacia (album)|Anastacia]]'' quickly became her most successful album to date, giving her a third consecutive triple platinum album in the UK and reaching the top of the national charts in Ireland, the Netherlands, Australia, Greece, Germany and other countries. Unlike her first two albums, which were released in her homeland of America, ''Anastacia'' was not, despite being scheduled for release on three occasions. \"[[Left Outside Alone]]\" was released twice, but failed to pick up heavy airplay.<ref name=\"BiographyChannel\"/> It only gained sporadic [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] format airplay. Again, it sparked [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic/Dance]] format airplay and the dance mix of \"Left Outside Alone\" peaked at number five on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. After the original version of \"Left Outside Alone\" failed to catch on because of lukewarm promotion, especially on radio, the album was postponed and eventually cancelled after the release date of August 30, 2004, passed. Anastacia released three further internationally successful singles; \"[[Sick and Tired (Anastacia song)|Sick and Tired]]\" (which gave her another number one in Spain and another UK top five single), \"[[Welcome to My Truth]]\" (her best-selling hit in Spain), and the ballad \"[[Heavy on My Heart]]\", sales of which went towards the Anastacia Fund (a charitable organization providing [[research funding]] for breast cancer).[[File:Heavy Rotation 3.jpg|thumb|Anastacia performing live in 2005|254x254px]]A small batch of [[Anastacia (album)|her self-titled album]] was released with a bonus DVD, poster and slip case.

Even though [[Sony BMG]] did force her to release this collection, Anastacia has said that she is happy now that it was created as it was like a \"story book\", or summary of the first six years of her career.

Anastacia however remained positive, stating that other artists have faced the same problems while changing a record label, also blaming the world [[Great Recession|economical crisis]] and the label's decision to alter her sound from her own chosen sprock{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sprack|date=October 2022}} sound of her previous record to a more \"urban feel\".
