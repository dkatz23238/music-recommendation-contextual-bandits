The band's most recent lineup before going on hiatus consisted of [[Richard Archer]] ([[singing|lead vocals]] and [[electric guitar|guitar]]), Kai Stephens ([[bass guitar]] and backing vocals) and [[Steve Kemp (musician)|Steve Kemp]] ([[drum kit|drums]] and backing vocals). Founding member Ross Phillips (guitar and backing vocals) left the band on 6 May 2013 but returned in 2014 to promote the release of their greatest hits album, ''[[Hard-Fi: Best of 2004 \u2013 2014|Best of 2004 \u2013 2014]]'', and the one-off gig on 13 February 2014.\n\nThey achieved chart success with their third single, \"[[Hard to Beat]]\"<ref>[http://acharts.us/song/2143 \"Music Charts: \"Hard-Fi - Hard to Beat\"]. aCharts.us.</ref> and then followed by other successful singles such as \"[[Living for the Weekend (Hard-Fi song)|Living for the Weekend]]\"<ref>[http://acharts.us/song/9869 \"Music Charts: \"Hard-Fi - Living for the Weekend\"]. aCharts.us.</ref> and \"[[Cash Machine]]\",<ref>[http://acharts.us/song/7280 \"Music Charts: \"Hard-Fi - Cash Machine\"]. aCharts.us.</ref> which all reached the top 20 of the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>[http://acharts.us/performer/hardfi \"Music Charts: \"Hard-Fi\"]. aCharts.us.</ref> Their debut album ''[[Stars of CCTV]]'' was released on 4 July 2005,<ref name=\"Hard-Fi : Discography\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hard-fi.com/discography.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223214846/http://www.hard-fi.com/discography.php|url-status=dead|title=Hard-Fi : Discography|archivedate=23 December 2007}}</ref> and although receiving critical acclaim (''[[NME]]'' called it the 23rd best album of 2005 and it was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]] and two [[Brit Awards]]; Best British Group and Best British Rock Act),<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/bestalbumsandtracksoftheyear/2005-2-1045347|title=2005 - NME|date=2016-10-10|work=NME|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\"Hard-Fi battle to beat Mercury odds\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4207346.stm|title=Hard-Fi battle to beat Mercury odds|publisher=BBC | date=4 September 2005 | access-date=5 January 2010|first=Ian|last=Youngs}}</ref> it did not reach No.&nbsp;1 on the UK Albums Chart until six months later on 22 January 2006.<ref name=\"acharts.us\">[http://acharts.us/album/16904 \"Music Charts: \"Hard-Fi - Stars of CCTV\"]. aCharts.us.</ref> It originally entered the charts at number 6.<ref name=\"acharts.us\"/> The band's second album ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West (album)|Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' was released on 3 September 2007<ref name=\"Hard-Fi : Discography\"/> and reached number 1 in its first week.<ref>[http://acharts.us/album/27862 \"Music Charts: \"Hard-Fi - Once Upon a Time in the West\"]. aCharts.us.</ref> Their third album ''[[Killer Sounds]]'', which features the singles \"[[Good for Nothing (song)|Good for Nothing]]\", \"[[Fire in the House]]\" and \"[[Bring It On (Hard-Fi song)|Bring It On]]\", was released on 19 August 2011 and debuted at number 9 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Contempo band ===\n[[Richard Archer]] decided to return to his hometown of [[Staines]], crushed by the lack of success of his former band [[Contempo (band)|Contempo]] and the death of his father from cancer. He said \"I moved back to Staines because I ran out of money and it was quite a shock.\"\n\nArcher claims that music business insiders tried to dissuade the band's manager Warren Clarke from managing him. When Archer asked his publishers for some money to record the new songs that he had written, they terminated his contract instead. \"People told him, don't bother with Archer, he's damaged goods, you're wasting your time.\"<ref name=\"Hard-Fi Flash site including Biography\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hard-fi.com/flash.html|title=Hard-Fi flash|publisher=Hard-Fi|format=Flash|access-date=19 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006141444/http://www.hard-fi.com/flash.html|archive-date=6 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Hard-Fi - Rockin' The City Video Podcast Part One\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvAspgJdhlA |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/wvAspgJdhlA |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Hard-Fi - Rockin' The City Video Podcast Part One|publisher=Hard-Fi}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation and early success ===\n\nWhile Archer was making demos to produce an album, he went into the Staines hi-fi shop where Ross Phillips worked, simply so he could listen to his latest demos on the shop's best equipment.

The majority of ''Stars of CCTV'' was recorded in a variety of unusual acoustic environments - in bedrooms, in pubs, and played back in their producer, Wolsey White's, [[BMW]]. 1000 copies of this record were pressed with only 500 going on public sale, and the initial plan was to sell 1000 each time. However, it quickly sold out, receiving critical acclaim and radio play, proving a lot more successful than the band had imagined. Most of the album was recorded in a disused [[Taxicab|mini cab]] office, which cost them about \u00a3300 and is known to this day as the \"Cherry Lips\" Studio. The band used to try to make their music sound more atmospheric by putting a microphone in the corridor to add echo; listening closely to the record reveals that this also picked up passers-by humming and whistling and the occasional aeroplane flying overhead.\n\nArcher desperately tried to generate publicity for the band through the ''Staines Observer'', to no avail; \"We sent them a press release and a photo,\" said Archer. \"The press release was all like, the hard-hitting sound of the streets and stuff. And the article came out going, 'Richard Archer, former pupil of Thamesmead School ...' Whatever you say, they seem to be most interested in what school you went to.\"\n\nThe band were then licensed to the major label [[Atlantic Records]] in December 2004, where they were given the chance to re-record the album in the renowned [[Abbey Road Studios]], among other well known studios, however they went back to the cab office to maintain their sound.\n\n=== ''Stars of CCTV'' ===\n{{Main|Stars of CCTV}}\n\nThe band were one of the acts opening for [[Green Day]], alongside [[Taking Back Sunday]] and [[Jimmy Eat World]] on their two-day residency of the [[Milton Keynes Bowl]] in June 2005. [[Simple Plan]] were initially booked though cancelled only a few weeks before the show, and Hard-Fi were made as a last minute booking and opened on both days. Their debut album's launch party was scheduled to be 7 July 2005 at Cheekees nightclub in Staines, however this was cancelled due to the ill health of Richard's mother, and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]] also occurring that day. Her death resulted in the band pulling out of the [[Glastonbury festival]]. The launch party was rescheduled for 13 July 2005 and the venue changed to [[Ladbroke Grove]], London.\n\nThe ''Stars of CCTV'' album re-entered the official UK album chart at No.&nbsp;4 on 1 January 2006. Two places higher than it originally went in on the week of its release, the album climbed from No.&nbsp;33. ''Stars of CCTV'' finally got to No.&nbsp;1 on 22 January. The band's re-release of \"Cash Machine\" entered the official Top 40 singles chart at No.&nbsp;14 on 1 January.

Once Hard-Fi were becoming successful, Richard's mother died and the song \"Help Me Please\" is about how difficult it was for him having his dreams come true after many unsuccessful bands but realises he has no parents to share the joy with. Similarly, \"The King\" is about Richard returning to Staines and finding everything completely different, and realising everything of which he knew and loved had disappeared.
