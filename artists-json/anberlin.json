If it helps people in whatever circumstances they're in, that's amazing, but I definitely don't classify us as a Christian band.\"<ref name=\"Anberlin Aren't Christian Rock\"/> Elsewhere, Christian has remarked, \"[My faith] affects every single aspect of my life, but I'm not a preacher, I'm an entertainer.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisweeknews.com/?sec=home&story=sites/thisweeknews/042607/common/News/042607-News-345223.html| title= Florida-based band Anberlin to play the Basement May 1| publisher= ThisWeek Community Newspapers| date= April 26, 2007|access-date=January 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nDespite these statements and others of the like, multiple sources list the band as part of the Christian rock genre, and some Anberlin song lyrics do contain Christian references. Furthermore, the band appears at Christian music festivals such as [[Parachute Music Festival]] and [[Cornerstone Festival]], and their songs have been included on Christian rock compilation CDs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicmoz.org/Releases/Compilations/X/X_2003-_Experience_The_Alternative/|title=MusicMoz - Releases: Compilations: X: X 2003- Experience The Alternative|website=musicmoz.org}}</ref> and DVDs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I2ISE0|title=Amazon -- X 2007}}</ref>  They are also played on the [[Gospel Music Channel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelmusicchannel.com/artists/detail/anberlin |title=Anberlin &#124; Christian Music - Gospel Music Channel |publisher=Gospelmusicchannel.com |access-date=October 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828193938/http://gospelmusicchannel.com/artists/detail/anberlin |archive-date=August 28, 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nAnberlin has also been repeatedly featured in Christian rock magazine ''HM'' (''Hard Music'', which was originally the fanzine ''Heaven's Metal''). Christian submitted a letter to the magazine, criticizing the more overtly religious [[Christian punk]] band the [[Knights of the New Crusade]] for a promotional image that represented a \"black mark on the face of Christianity\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/exclusive/anberlins_stephen_goes_off200503/index.php |title=Anberlin's Stephen Goes Off|publisher=HM Letters to the Editor, HM Online Exclusives|access-date=January 5, 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090129195459/http://hmmagazine.com/exclusive/anberlins_stephen_goes_off200503/index.php| archive-date= January 29, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nChristian has also said in an interview with Lightforce radio how the band tries to \"step out of the bubble\" and referred to themselves as being part of Christian music. He discussed in detail what Christians should do in their lives: love and embrace others as [[Jesus]] would as well as show God's grace to others. He mentioned as well how the band [[Fall Out Boy]] said in an interview that they did not really know much about Jesus until Anberlin toured with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.thejoyfm.com/cruise/lightforce/steveninterview.mp3|title=The Joy FM Radio Interview}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with Smartpunk, drummer Nathan Young commented, \"The thing is, some bands that are trying to get out of the Christian market, they get bummed out by questions about it. I don\u2019t really mind it, because I\u2019m a Christian, and I\u2019m okay talking about it. With the whole term 'Christian Band,' I don\u2019t understand how a band can be Christian.
